  Brought this phone for my wife who is die hard fan for oppo...Offer like 2000 extra off on exchange with Oppo is just like waww....So after exchange of her old oppo mobile I got this phone for just Rs.6800.... Best phone if u want oppo brand name and u are boared to ur old oppo phone... So this review is considering 6800 cost...Pros.1) good features considering cost 6800.2) Size matters 6.5 inch grt3) Speakers are good Dolby4) Comes with classic headphones with good looks and decent sound quality... No other phones now a days comes with headphones...5) Quad camera gives good quality photos...6) Selfie camera is also decent considering cost 68007) 5000mAh battery8) can be use as power bank for other phonesCons:1) Original cost 13990 is huge considering features...Other good brands like MI, VIVO, MOTO, etc sells 48MP camera phones for 12000 and so...2) Accessories like back cover, tempered glass are yet not in market... May be u have to wait for them...Though 1 transparent back cover is included in Mobile Box...This is all about this phone after 24hrs use....I will update if something comes...

  Best option for exchange, I got it in 9k ,Review score (out of 5)Design : 4.5 (finger print scanner position is bit high), other things like screen size, corners,back panel, camera position are perfect and it's light weight too...Sounds quality : 5/5 (unexpected, dual side stereo and Dolby is awesome, loudness, clarity and effects are far better then any other phone i.e. mi 7 pro, Lenovo, Samsung or honor)Photography : it's similar to other available options in market, day light as usual is very clear and crisp, didn't get time for more night photography, but few repetitive uploaded pics are in night mode with very minimal light which are good.Battery backup : best in this category (10% ~ 3 hours of heavy uses) , for heavy uses 30hours for normal uses it ll go up to 2 days.Performance : not played many games but seems good, while opening any game auto memory cleaner will run,lag and heat issue is not there (checked continuously 1.5 hours)Memory space : 46 GB free space, all basic apps are pre installed, separate as card slot is available (apart from 2 SIM slot), 1.86 GB ram available after all updation, while playing any game also 900 to 1 GB space is availablePros : apart from above mentioned points :1)Front cam is good like other similar phone (mi, real me, honor, Samsung)2) earphones quality/look is very good in this range.3) dual speaker position is in front top of display and near to charging pin, so stereo comes properly4)face detection is fast5)no heating issue while charging /YouTube /gaming6) battery is lasting for more than 4 days on normal usesCons:1) fingerprint scanner position is bit high2) ram 6 GB would have a perfect option3) macro photos are not that good compare to redmi 7 pro4) no fast charger with pack

  Oppo makes very nice phone at this price range about quad cameras but we have another option to select Realme smartphones which is comparatively low budget and good cameras...But this phone I like mostly in battery back up with type C charger.. and also like camera clearity because I have already attached some snaps here from my Oppo A5 2020...Overall good performance of this phone and speaker was nice sounds which is have dual atmos..Thanks Oppo

  Lowest speed ever seen in android and charger not support to battery. It will be 3 hours to take full charge

"
"

  The first thing is slow charging of this mobile taking more than 3 hours for full charging.  My friend bought the same mobile but that was 4 gb ram and 64 gb rom in which he got hand free but my mobile was 3 gb ram and 64 rom in which they are not providing hand free. Why?

"
"

  Its Camera gives pictures .. like .keypad mobile who has vga camera very poor in camera u get redish images i have never seen such worst device it often get stuck in between apps .. evn u dnt have pubg like games in ur device still it get stuck in usual apps .. it is better to buy a keypad mobile .rather than oppo a5 2020 struggled a lot with this device .. finally got returned thank god ... I truely suggest u people out there . Do not waste your money in buying this device

"
"

  Pros- Phone looks actually good  Good battery lifeCons- phone is too heavy  Camera performance not upto the  mark.Go for MI A3 if u don't want the cons

"
"

  It's a nice phone , quite heavy that might be due to it's 5000mah battery. Gaaming is awesome , camera is not upto the mark, quad camera is just locha, night mode doesn't satisfy you,And the most important thing it lacks is the LED NOTIFICATION LIGHT it's a must and seeing it's price (13k) notification light must have arranged,I bought this phone in exchange don't buy it without exchange because you can get a much better phone in this price . nest with exchange

  OPPO A5: This is faulty product selling by Amazon. and they have shake hand with the the agent to fool customer.The camera quality of this mobile is worst and regarding this on 3rd day itself i wanted to return the product but Amazon has denied it saying its not their fault and product is not manufactured by them. But if the product is not manufactured by them and the product is faulty then they shall take return of the product and should return my money back. But Amazon executive is not taking the request of return for this product. this is straight away fooling the customer by Amazon.

"
"

   So the mobile was delivered to me on 20July,20 & the fingerprint scanner stopped working on 11Aug,20 ie less than a month ai it's within one month of purchase the scanner stopped working & if anyone is concerned I have already tried hard reset, soft reset of the handset but the scanner never worked as you can see in the video attached moreover they are still installing the bloatware eg helo app (as seen in the screen shot) which have been BANNED... by the Indian Government.. its not a small issue.. as they are still not working for the safety of there Indian customer... Thus never going to recommend a oppo mobile to anyone not even entry level & just forget about the high-end series...

  Guys I got this phone with exchange of my MiA1 only RS. 6200Review giving after using this phone for 15 days.Pros:1. Bettery backup is superb.  I have to charge it alternate days.2. Display is awesome3. Camera quality is good but you must have the knowledge of lighting to take awesome pictures.4. RAM 4gb and ROM 64gb is quite good for normal use5. Face recognition is very fast.Cons:1. Camera is not good for those who don't understand the lighting position. Only those user complain about it.2. Pattern lock is not available, you have to satisfied with face lock or numeric lock.3. Weight around 200gms.Overall a good phone with exchange and it will never disappoint you. Trust me.

"

  It's a great product to have in this price range. Very sturdy design and comes with very good quality back cover. It really protect the phone when falls down.Camera quality is great outdoor and indoor. Speaker is very very good. Fingerprint scanner and face recognization works excellently.Battery last long, very long but dispit having c-type charger it take bit time to recharge fully. For average use/ non-gaming use it last for almost 2 n half day.Only thing I don't like is the weight of the phone. You feel the weight of the phone after some time specially if you are watching long videos n all.I got it in additional exchange value offer so I it's above the average value for money for me. It comes with one year complete protection so if you have kids in the house definitely buy this product. It has blue light filters do saves your child's eye sights.

  Pros - 1. Battery life is Excellent.  2. Feels nice in the hand & looks stunning.  3. Stereo Speaker gives a great experience.  4. Snapdragon 665 is decent for normal users, good for casual games but not for heavy games.  5. Has widevine L1 Certification, so u can stream Netflix, Amazon Prime In FHD.  6. Has Usb Type C, nice to have this.Cons - 1. Display is 720p, not a good display.  2. Doesn't support fast charging.  3. Cameras are too bad, for normal pictures it's also not good, don't even think about good shots.  4. Storage speed is slow, ram management is very poor.  5.

  I bought this phone for my parents as a gift, its been a week they haven't got any problem with this device so far from their prospective, great camera quality, and long battery life, great build quality, i highly recommend this phone for basic / average user.one thing This phone steps behind is for No fast charging feature, it would be so great to have such feature, anyway i was aware of this before buying so not an issue. the Other thing is that, this phone can be used as a battery bank for other phone, which is totally useless feature if anyone ask me, you have to buy additional wires for that too. BONUS! ColorOS contains bloatware that CANNOT be disabled (for just this, 1 star from review rating is reduced) I really really! hate to not have control over my phone, this thing actually encourage people towards rooting phone, the specific app I hated most is OPPO app market!! WHY? who use this? gladly i am not the user, my parents seems doesn't care about that.but anyway, Overall OPPO A5 2020 is great value phone for basic daily uses and some average gaming

  I bought this Phone and used 48 hr . Here I am sharing my review about this PhoneProns1.value for money2.Battery back-up is very good in normal usages3.rear camera is decent but need to improve4.selfie camera is very good compared to other phones5.Display is Decent only.6.inbuild tempered glass and transparent backcover is excellent quallity7.Dolby Atmos speaker's are excellent8.No heating issues on wifi Cons1.Power Adaptor (charger) is made in china.company itself says product is made in India and I don't know why they give china charger2.No Fast charging option.it takes 3hr minimum to 0 to 1003.There is no Led Notification indicator. This is the biggest drawbacks of this Phone because even 3000 rs phones comes with led notification indicator

  I exchanged this for my Redmi Note 4. All said and done, I think, I shouldn't have. The Redmi Note (4 or any other version since) is superior in every way - scores over the Oppo in both departments  - hardware and software. I would have bought the new Redmi 9 but it wasn't available for exchange and I wasn't about to pay 4000 more. Besides there is the Redmi 9 and then there is a Redmi Note 9 and both offerings use the Mediatek processor, this time over, if I am not mistaken, instead of the Qualcomm Snapdragon, and it is early days yet - with the reviews. They say some flavors of the Mediatek are doing as well as the Qualcomm Snapdragon, but I can't be sure and you might want to look up the data on that elsewhere - say NDTV gadgets or some such site.The Oppo's operating system ""Color OS"" sucks big time. Among other annoyances the most visible / obvious ones are : you don't get that slider to get past the screen saver, and you have to punch in your security numbers every time - which is a bit of a pain and also they want you to pay them anything in between 24 to a couple of hundred bucks for a new theme, which you can get on other phones for free (or at least I did with Redmi). Who in their right mind will pay for kitschy wallpaper and cheap fonts from when windows was launched in 1985 (you know the type that was included in all kinds of ""banner"" software and then made it's way into software like wordstar? that). Also, from day one, the ""assistive ball"" is missing for me. I would use the assistive ball to take screenshots or the one-touch turn off display button. I tried to reach oppo customer service about it. try as I might, i couldn't call them and then I found an email id and tried to write to them, but they didn't have an answer either. The best they could do is ask me to reset the OS all over again - which of course I am not going to do. It would mean downloading and installing all the apps again. And if it still doesn't correct the problem, I'd have lost all that valuable bandwidth for nothing. Also, it would reset some of the bloatware I got rid off, so painstakingly.  I can always use the system one touch turn off display icon from the tray. But shiver me timbers! if I ever need to reach them about a genuine SOS kinda issue, then what?!The other thing that you miss when moving from the Redmi to this one is the Redmi OS's ""Second Space"" feature. The dual device mode (not the same as dual apps). It's like you have a laptop / PC with two operating systems to choose from only you can switch from one to the other when your phone is still on - fully booted up and while working on one OS. Like an alt + tab on the PC, switch from one ""space"" to the other and back again. Talk to the wife on the one end and exchange whatsapp with the girlfriend on the other (kidding. have neither a wife or a girlfriend! but think about those who do! what fun! yeah? they made a phone for adulterers!).I tried to take a picture of the full moon at night the other evening, and all I got was white light in the frame! Now, the thing has four cameras, with goodness knows how many megapixels and it's been a while since smartphones have been at it - so, you'd think they might have the whole point-and-shoot thing in the bag, wouldn't you? At least don't dissolve a perfectly round moon into Jesus' second coming! Elsewhere I read, the OPPO isn't what you use for night photography, but it takes okay enough pictures during the day. But that's like shortchanging you 50 percent on the cameras. It's like they punched in four holes in the thing and stuck in a few lenses that don't do nothing ever for you, like a cheap Rolex knock-off that sits there on your wrist, but won't tell the time.  I don't use the camera, so I won't complain, but you don't want to buy the Oppo to take pictures then.I had a good mind of returning it and get my money back before the window closes but I don't want to go through the hassle all over again (of buying another phone). It works and I am able to use it to connect to the internet. I can only hope that the thing does not develop any snags going ahead and at least lasts me a few years before I can afford to buy me another phone!so, yeah. underwhelmed. but on the plus side, i knocked Rs. 3500/- off of the marked price, got me a little more space (the old Redmi had 32GB and this one has 64, not that it makes a difference to me. A good chunk is taken away by the OS and leaves about 40 GB available to me for my apps, audio and ebooks) , and also I got me 4gb of RAM. That's a GB more and the good thing about that is I don't have to start the Amazon app again every time I go away googling for the answers to the Amazon quiz. (what? so I cheat! it's not like I have won anything ever or am ever gonna win anything anyway!)

  1. No wifi calling right out of the box but once you update it you get WiFi calling .2. Phone is heavy : my hands literally start to pain after few hours of use. Mainly chat.3. Battery, display, camera is all fine. For this price range.4. My biggest disappointment is weight.5. After 4 months phone started getting hang sometime. Not too much but still.

  Camera quality poor mob gets hot while playing game

  This phone is too good in battery life. If you like music there is awesome Dolby atmos system. Good fone in budget. Camera performance is also excellent in this budget category. Performance and Display is also good. You can play pubg without any lag and with excellent battery backup.Overall, good phone in this category

"

  Best if you get it under 10k. I got it on sale + exchange so the deal was fine for me.Display 3.5/5Camera 2.5/5Battery 5/5Charging 3/5Performance 3.5/5No headsets for 3gb variant🤦‍♂️🤷‍♂️Fingerfrint is fast. I don't use face unlock. SD665 is great budget chipset. Updated to Android 10 but color os is just meh. I mean out for 3gb ram it uses 1.5gb, with some permanent services you are left with 1gb free memory. Bought it for my parents so no big deal as they are not heavy users but if you are a heavy user, either don't buy color os phone or atleast go for 4gb variants.

"
"

  So I bought this phone for my dad.Pricing is a bit high even for 3GB version. However I got it at 9,400 on sale so a pretty good deal.Pros:1. Big screen2. Widevine L1 certification3. Stereo speakers which are quite loud and great for such a cheap phone4. Dolby Atmos5. Two usable cameras incl. Ultra Wide6. 5000mah battery with type C charging (again quite rare at this price point)7. Android 10 update (rare for entry level phones)Cons:1. Ultra wide camera is lackluster2. 10watt charging support only3. L1 certification is only for show as Netflix and Prime do not support the phone for HD streamingIf you are getting it sale then it is quite a good phone, but if not on sale then there are better options out there from Samsung, Realme and Redmi.

  The phone is good in terms of battery life and memory only. Rest nothing is good about it. I received this on 13th August and writing review on 20th August. Here are the issues:1. The camera is very poor. It has too much noise and picture quality isn't good.2. This phone doesn't support direct video calls. That's pathetic.3. Phone gets heat up and the charger heats up more than that. I've shared a screenshot of 43°C but I've noticed the temperature going 45°C. If you are using online meeting apps like zoom, ms teams or Google meet, the heating is little faster. The worse part is that it gets up heated while calling which makes it highly uncomfortable to talk and even hold in hands.4. Whatsapp notifications stuck on the screen for few seconds while watching online videos.5. You can't see YouTube videos more than 480p, sometimes a few videos stream at 720p. Same videos run at 1080p on other devices.6. The customer care executives aren't able to understand the problem. I've called 5 times since Sunday but they conduct and suggest the same solution for better performance of the phone but no improvements have been noticed. Yesterday I was convinced that Amazon has registered the problem and will get back to me but I'm waiting since yesterday afternoon and my query hasn't come yet.7. Amazon fools you. It decreased its prices on 6-7 August for sale. I was happy that this product is available at a lower price but the decreased price has become fixed now. So whenever you see a sale, always buy electronic products after the sale is over and don't become a fool. I bought this item based on my friends recommendations (since I needed a phone urgently for my work) but I'm done buying any electronic products from Amazon.

  First impressions - Beautiful ! Design and build - full marks..This is my first Oppo experience. Bought it as a gift for a near one.It has all that you need! I haven't enabled the finger print sensor as its not needed as yet. Touch is as responsive as my OnePlus 6T I use.  Its just 2 days of use. Its just the perfect blend of features and great specs it already has. No lag whatsoever and this is the 3 GB version. No bloatware.What more can one want ? Overall Excellent VFM !

  I had never thought I would go for this phone.I had thought to buy redmi note 9 which went out of stock and I needed a phone urgently.Then finally I had to buy this. It is really amazing. I was not having good opinion about this phone , but its AMAZING.Camera: The rear camera performnace is realy amazing at this price point. Front camera performance is above average. I wouldnt recommend selfie lovers.The video stabalisation of rare camera is like other phone in price segmant like redmi note 8.Battery: The battery is the beast . It lasts a day smoothly after heavy use and may even remiain after that.Performance: Its good . I wouldnt say its bestBut redmi note 9/note 8 is better in smoothness if compared. But its smooth.Pros(my point of view):1. Camera is outstanding for the price2. Speakers are extra loud and have good quality3. Screen is really large and colours pop out amazingly4. Fingerprint and face unlock are like flagship phones5. Design feels rich6. Phone feels light in handCons:1. Front camera could be improved2.the speed of scrolling is a bit slow( Im not sure, i guess it can be fixed through settings)3. Camera app could have more features like night mode

  I am a normal phone user, so dont  like to play game in Phone and waste time.But want to give a honest review1) I have taken White colour Phone and its really looking great. I will suggest dont go for Black.2) Camera Is good total 4+1 Lense are there , Selfie is also good but not up to the mark. but back camera is very good . We should expect DSLR quality from Phone camera so My rating is 4.3) Charging is quite good and fast .4) Company is providing back cover and earphone so it saves Rs.500/- Earphone sound is very good and soft.5) Finger Sensor rating is 46) Using since 24 Hours and not fell any lagging. Installed my Office application and its quit good and Fast.7) Better than MI (Xiomi) because now these days MI comes in Sale and in few minutes it will finish , but I would recommend  for this no need to wait for sale and quite a good phone in this 12000/- range.8) Delivery took less than 24 hours and I am not a prime member- Credit goes to Amazon.Cons1) Ring tone is little bit low

"
"

  Its camera quality is very very bad..Problems which i am facing are-1. Heating issue2. unusual battery draining3. 3.5 mm port defective. There are so many smartphones available in this price segment..so please don't waste your money

"
"

  This phone has one of the best dual speakers available in the market, its loud and clear with dolby atmos.Display is 720 p but its bright and overall picture quality and sound effects are amazing.Processor sd 665 is nice too, you can play pub g and most of the heavy games on it with medium to high settings.Call quality, wifi receiver and every other aspect of this phone is nice for this budget. of 10 to 11 K.Whats not good with this phone is - battery Charging time !!!!!!! it takes 3hrs to charge from 0 to 100 with 10 watt charger. Discharge of battrey is good because of 11nm chipset so kinda helps in number of times you will charge.Canera quality is ok, not the best but does justice to the price.Definitely recommend it to others if you dont mind 2-3 hrs charging time.

"
"

  The phone is good but in 2020 you can get a better spec with the same budget. It can be any other Oppo or any other brand. But it won't disappoint you. The only bad is it's camera. Not that much good if you are a photoholic person. Otherwise it will satisfy you in every other aspect. Be it battery life or display or sound quality. No heating issue. Fingerprint sensor is excellent. Overall 3.5 star.

  Screen -Screen quality is very veryy bad. After 30 minutes of continuously uses i have headache & pain in eye's.Let's talk about the processor -Performance of Snapdragon 665 processor is very bad in this phone even my Redmi note 5 pro which is 2 years old & has Snapdragon 636 processor is perform better in Games especially in PUBG.Camera -Both Cameras are decentGameplay -When i start playing PUBG i experience a huge Lag problem & Continuously frame Drops even in very low Graphics ( So Smooth + Medium ). I wouldn't expect this type of performance.Performance in gaming is very Bad.Other -The pre apllied Screen protector is very bad. It has 0% smoothness.The Sterio Speakers is not that laoud as other smartphone which has Sterio Speakers.Battery -Battery life is ok but not as i expect. But the main problem is charging it takes approximately 2:30 - 3 hours to charge 100%. Charging speed is very slow. If you are in hurry or in emergency belive me this phone is Sucks & get cheated with youDesign -Design is very good but the white colour became dull very easily.Accessories -You get a 10w charger & usb type-C which is of  Poor quality.You only get earphone with 4gb model. with 3 gb model you  can't get earphones.Please Don't wasn't your money Here. Go somewhere else.

  Hey Amazon, this time I fell cheated by you, low quality product by oppo, if possible please change the product with other brand,With regardsWaiting for reply,,,,

  Oppo A5 2020 is good enough as per budget but operating system needs to be little more upgraded. Phone app/calling app is not user friendly.  It is same like redmi phone app. And gallery media files are arranged in a reverse dated rows means you will find media files like pics/videos from current dates at the bottom and very old dated at the top which is not convenient.  Rest all is fine.

"
"

  The phone built quality seems good with good finishing. Has a good camera. Audio quality is good. But the screen size is large and can be uncomfortable while riding a bike. Also, the audio jack is on the bottom side,so if you are an avid music listener the cable could bend a lot. For the price I paid I am very happy with the product as I have found the camera and the audio very good. The screen resolution could have been better though for the size of the screen used. Have shared few images shot on the phone. The video stabilisation also seems to be good.  Overall its a very good phone.

  I purchased this device for my father, who's priority is whatsapp and YouTube only with some step counting and calories burning counting apps. For that purpose this device is fine. But as it's having sd 665 ai processor I tested it with gameplay of freefire in low settings and device got hanged, with unbearable fluctuating FPS. I changed certain settings in developer options to make more ram free and bang performance of gaming improved drastically. This simply means this device has bad ram management and it really needs to ne worked out. I would suggest if you bare planning to buy this device with multitasking and gaming in mind than think twice, otherwise it's Ok to go for it.

  I purchased this phone only for Vowifi  calling as call drop was the major concern that too from all network provider in my lane and conditions worsens after entering the house. But Vowifi works inside also... So I purchased it for vowifi. Firstly I got annoyed as I didn't find the vowifi feature (though i checked in internet before purchasing) . But then there was a catch that only oppo 2020 having Color OS 7 have this feature and upgrades will be available for phones having build version ending with 48 and 51. This I came to know from Oppo customer care. Thankfully my phone was in list of updated ones and after updating it serves the purpose. Now I can make and receive calls even inside house. Weight Slightly on higher side but touch and camera are gud.

  I have been using phone almost one month. I am satisfied. This phone is more good that what I have expected. Starting with camera ,it is only a average camera not bad but has 4k video recording. Battery life is excellent. I am getting 11 plus hours ON screen usage. Then the most good part of the phone is it's speakers and finger print scanner. Screen is not full hd only 720p but it's good . Phones design is perfect. In my usage of 1 month I haven't felt any lag even when I played Pubg. I can't find any dark mode on this phone. In my first impression the phone was a bit heavy. But after usng it I am used to it. Overall a good phone for day to day use.

"

  Guyzz, phone is good with all it's features and under this budget.As per Amazon app, the box will have headset along with other accessories, when I purchased one, found that headset is missing so I went for replacement. Even the replacement box doesn't have headset.Think twice

"
"

  Phone is good at the price point camera is good battery life 2 days if you not using heavy gaming , but i sugeest to amazon the that delivery person had no manners to talk with coustemers specially with girls i oderd for my sister and she called me and said very bad beahviour done by courir boy☹️☹️☹️

"
"

  Phone design look pretty cool and battery backup is amazing. Camera is decent but I'm not that  kind of  person who takes different, different, types of photos.If compare to price Oppo A5 2020 is expensive, I got the device at 13,990 rupees ( 4GB/64GB). At this price point they should give FHD+ display & fast charging, compare to competition.

"
"

  If u want to buy a good phone in same price range ....check out others company products...it's almost gud but little costly and there is greater issue about system update...when u update , update complete upto 100% after using lot of internet..but phone not get updated & features remain same as before it is....It always give notification of new update is available...I tried to get rid of this issue but it is in vain..and no any earphone is available with this phone..I m just suggesting, if you are oppo lover then go for it only with exachange of mobile due to it costs u less, else I recommend not to buy the phone due to its issues with more cost...

"
"

  At price of rs 12000 it’s very poor in terms of its1touch screen. U need to press little hard on screen.2 fast charging option is missing. Don’t not support fastcharger.3 camera is very poor in its resolution. Chinese product claim just in terms of mega pixels but quality is just in half of the range of its claim.4. Forget about HD+It’s not even HDGood aspects1 screen Size is good2 exchange offer is provided. Which is missing in readmi 9prime . Readmi much better in quality with 2000 less in price.I admit I have made bad choice. Do watch reviews on YouTube.

"
"

  Good mobile . Cam quality is good. Big screen mobile using for movies of prime.And HD vedios. But it's pin is different from others that is so frestative . U can get samsung ate the same cost & better features like cam and battery life. But good . Value of money

"
"

  I have been using this phone for around two weeks and following are the pros and cons I found of this device:Pros1. Battery life is supperb, the HD plus  screen kind off consumes less power than a Full HD screen and hence battery life with a 5000 mah battery is really good.2. Speaker and sound is absolutely best, dolby atmos is amazing to hear, there are two speakers on this phone.3. Quad cameras, there are four of them in the rear and they take decent photos for this price range.4. Android 10 update with dark mode looks awesome along with colorOS 7 UI.5. Display is very good inspite of being only HD plus display.6. Snapdragon 665 can run most games at medium settings without any problem.Cons1. No fast charge, it will take around 2 hours to fully charge this phone to 100% from 10%.2. Screen resolution should have been Full HD and many of the completitors are offering it at this price.3. Front camera not as good as you would expect despite being 8 mp.

"
"

  Good quality display even if its a HD+ display, Color OS 7 is a big improvement over its predecessor, UI is customizable according to your taste, Dependable cameras, Goodness of snapdragon 665, good battery backup enough to last throughout the day, also has type-C charging port.Overall a good buy, recent mobile are always out of stock, however this was a very good alternative and dont regret buying it. Its performance is comparable to recently launched moto g9, nokia 5.3, redmi 9 prime, realme narzo.

"
"

  The phone has a lot of specifications and one of the best phone in this range. The thing which makes it special is its battery and processor. The snapdragon 660 and 5000mah the perfect combination for every normal user. The camera is not good while comparing to the other high end devices but its manageable. Loved this phone it is whole white and looks lavish.

"
"

  So I bought this phone for my Dad. Initially I had a budget of 12k and I was considering to buy Redmi 9 prime but it sells out almost immediately and offline it costs 2k moreAfter a bit of research I found this phone to be relevant and Cheaper.Performance is smooth as it has sd665 and battery life is great considering hd+ and 5000mah battery.Honestly I don't find a great deal of quality difference in terms of screen resolution as I myself use k20 pro which has FHd+ panel.It comes with Android 9 but it can be updated to Oreo in system updatesFew things which you may dislike are:A lot of crap apps some can be uninstalled and others can't.Camera performance (comparing from k20 pro perspective) is very average4 cameras mostly useless Ultrawide can be of a little use thoughFew things I liked arePlastic build is good and I personally liked itComes with a pretty good back case. Which my Dad is using from starting so it saved 200-300 rupeesType C charging is goodSize is great and light weight too

"
"

  Ordered on 26.7.2020Received on 28.7.2020Phone looks Good, considering the price range and when compared to other phones in this segment, it looks simple and elegant.Not a fan of color os.Installed a launcher, atleast to look somewhat like stock android.Display quality is ok.Speakers are awesome ( stereo speakers ).Battery life seems to be sceptical.Will update after a few days

"
"

  This mobile phone Oppo A5 2020 is very good , it has almost all features , the battery running fine , both the cameras are good , display is average , Wi-Fi calling is working fine . Overall the phone is good for this price range , I recommend this phone , great, go for it .....

"
"

  I thought OPPO will be a good choice...But except camera , nothing is good in this phone...The phone is much slower on internet compared to my previous phone....sometimes you hv to wait a lot to open site with high speed internet connection,  while other phones are much faster in same internet speed.Also keypads are problematic. Many a times you press one alphabet isctyped and will found different alphabet is typed..need lot of correction after typing..don't know, why it's happening...not a good phone at all..Don't buy it..

"
"

  I heard all the negative review but I guess it differs in my case it works well and the camera quality is good. It's definitely value your money.

"
"

  One of worst product ever seen,app cloner(dual app)is present but simultaneously maximum 2 app are use,fast charger is Not present as well as battery service is not good according to instructions by Oppo,Many more problem is present to this phone,I suggest you to not buy this phone at 12000 because there are many more options are available at this price

"
"

  The product is not up to the mark what it commits and says. Also the Product does not come with Ear Phones. Its either they r removed or not given with the Phone. This was 1st and Last time i have bought a phone from Amazon and would not suggest people to buy it from any of the Online site visit a shop and take it as per your preference and seeing the product.

"
"

  The phone is good. But camera quality is very poor. Please oppo sovle ta camera quality by giving us software updates. Price is slightly overpriced. battery of the phone is really noticable. But again camera is not good as described.

"
"

  1. Phones design perfect.2. Fingerprint reader and face unlock is fast.3. Audio quality awesome.4. Lot of required and important features.5. 44GB space present in 64GB.6. Updated to Android 10 also.7. Camera decent enough under 11,000 but there is no nightscape mode choice in camera app in 3GB RAM but captures good picture in dark.8. Processor is also good.9. Battery takes almost 3hr to charge from 0 to 100% but long lasting backup.10. Good for multitasking and multimedia but not for heavy gaming users.11. A great choice under 11,000 but if price more than that than you have lot of other good choices.

"
"

  Not even a month and the phone has problems. Screen is on and finger print reader, volume rocker and power not responding. Screen is unable to respond as well. Screen do not detect any touches. Regretting the purchase and sellers are clever enough to not to include a return more than 1 week from purchase.

"
"

   So good product it supports 4K camera video and photos 720 p full HD and 4k it supports. Battery life is good two day battery life. But for charging full  for 2and half hour it will take.I like it sooooo much after Redmi 7.redmi 7 is not good in privacy and camera.So I buy this phone

"
"

  Hello, This review I am giving after using phn for almost 3 month,1)It is very good phn in this price range,2) it has very good finger print sensor3) its processor is good No lag found till now4) camera is not good but it is ok for this price5) battery life is good but after continuous use or gaming it get hot6) over all this phn is good in this price range compare to redmi, Vivo, samsung

"
"

  first time ordered an OPPO phone. quite impressed by its features and specs. True to its specs, phone is working great, good battery life, looks amazing. I ordered a white white. The best part is that i received a silicon cover and a set of earphones with it included in the cost Rs.11,999/- as these we never get earphones in the box. I like the phone, may be 6 months down the line, i will buy another oppo replacing my xiomi.

"
"

  Very heavy phone, stutters slightly when scrolling and TOO MUCH BLOATWARE! Annoying! If this crap continues in the future I will only buy Android-One or iPhone. It's gotten completely ridiculous. Clean up Oppo!

"
"

  Dont buy any it.. camera blurred or take much attention during selfi.... cheat specs.

"
"

  All Ok with price 10990, But back panel is doesn't look too black it shines a lot with polished glass and lots of possibilities of straches if you are not using back cover then your mobile becomes damn old..... more over oppo occupies a lot of space in internal storage due to themes , software..etc... Over All good and takes upto 3hr charging time quite disappointing for Type C , looks bulky but standard mobile best exchange value ,Lasts up to 3-6years depends upon the user👍

"
"

  GenuinelyIt's useless camera phone even normal photos can't goodHorryble camera front camera 8mp can't capture better than my 2018 model MI y2Also very slow due to 3gb ram.battery good all day backup 5000mAhColour & Display is goodOverall better to go for xiomi at this price pointif you have budget get f series they perform betterHave you get some help.

"
"

  Country of origin is not India.This is made in China phone.

"
"

  Good phone in this price segment, quad cam , big battery, video stabilization, what more can u expect from a budget device.Reviewing after one day of use...Battery - 8/10Camera - 8/10Overall - 8/10No heating till now, works smooth, no lagging, overall a decent phone...

"
"

  It would be a great phone if it have full hd display yes it contains 720p resolution which is old in modelOther spped and hardware is okey for this deviceI have owned Xiaomi mobiles recently so i don't like its software as Xiaomi offers very easy excess to their apps but it doesn't

"
"

  Good value for money. Bought in Amazon big billion sale for my Mom getting good value for an old product and she's totally loving it.I was also looking for Samsung M30s but it doesn't have any screen protection and also it failed in one of the drop test. Moreover there was no good deal for exchanging on the same so had to go with this. And trust me using 1st time oppo, I wouldn't regret it.

"
"

  Fingerprint is slow and the smoothness of the screen is quite slow rest day to day performance is good not good for gaming just a entry level processor still does the basic jobs wellBattery life is amazing almost 8+ hours of sot but very very slow charging due to 10watt don't know if it supports 18 watt or notCamera is decent in lit environment low light quality is below averageSound quality is quite good due to dual speakersRest os is neat and clean no major problems noted

"
"

  I bought it for my Mom, we all know how our mom's use phone. They can easily spend a day or two by just simply looking at forwarded videos of their respective groups and surfing through fb. Hence my focus was to buy a long kasting battery life phone and I am happy to buy this one. Stunning performance, amazing camera. Processor is very fast and responds quickly as per the needs for which it was purchased. A perfect lower mid range phone.

"
"

  Pathetic....This phone doesn't even support normal usage and hangs like anything.Pls don't buy this, as after just 2 month of purchase this phone started lagging for no reason.I'm not a heavy user, neither I play games on ph nor I use heavy apps still this ph hangs.

"
"

  I got this phone from your website on 24th August 2020  it's been 34 days only that I am using it.The issue that I am facing after 10 days of use- it hangs a lotSecondly today on 29th Aug it's display turned out like showing in the pictures with this review.I don't want to go to the service center in this pandemic it's 60kms away from my home.Kindly replace this phone asap.I am hoping for the positive response from you.

"
"

  Excellent mobile phone with great features. Sound is awesome. Zumbo Battery backup but camera is average not better.

"
"

  i bought it with exchange of my old phone, so the price was reasonable for 4gb ram 128gb rom specs with snapdragon processor. few points.... 1. battery charges slowly(around 3hrs for full charge) but runs for more than 1 day with wifi, mobile data, gps, videos and other functions, 2. touch response is ok.... 3. not using it for gaming so without gaming no lags... 4. display is normal.... 5.  camera is ok.....overall good phone for normal usage not for gaming

"
"

  Respected sir, Camera may be increased high quality and pixels resolution also,then,data icon can be click ,It may be go to the particulars settings position.Next,It is swipe top to downward the hotspot shortcut key may be provided in the desktop...Thank you sir,

"
"

  Good Phone

"
"

  I have used Samsung, Redmi, Sony, Vivo phones, but I had never experienced such a sound system, it's great and First time I bought Oppo phone and its awesome. Just go for it.

"

  Good phone with exchangeDesign- 5 starPerformance- 4 starCamera - 1 starBattery - 4 star

"

  writing this review after two months of usage:Great phone at this price,but don't think massive battery lasts for 2 to3 days,it lasts for only 1 day.Camera is good for this price, finger print is too fast, front camera is average,display is good for this segment, charging takes moe than 2hr30 min to full charge,better than vivo at this price segment,processor is doing it's job well for games.Over all a good phone🙂🙂

"
"

  Had gifted my aunt as I was working on budget.  However, I don't like it's camera not picture quality.Although it is still working strong but my aunty's usuage is minimal.

"
"

  nice built phone, everything tremendous with economical budget purchase. Next we will update in near future about performance and its life durability about storage /RAM/ROM /SPEED.ALL app working nicely. camera image are also satisfactory.

"
"

  Super phone in this price range.Good quality of camera, sound etc...Finger print and face recognition readers still not checked and tried, based on the mobile performance  hopefully they also work well.Excellent product. Protective case given with this pack also excellent.

"
"

  Please do not buy this phone.  I got a broken phone.  It is not yet ready to be replaced or remedied.  They provide a very poor quality phone

"
"

  camera quality is too poor

"
"

  5 🌟 , good opportunity with to exchange. Happy with this.

"
"

  Battery heats up a bit if used for a sometime and during charging. Battery life does not look like 5000mAh if we see it getting low compared to iphones with way lesser mAh. Camera is fine. Apps and OS looks stable prima facie.

"
"

  fingerprint and faceunlock very fast.dolby sound osmmm.video quality average .battery best.day light camera good but not good for night  realy .pubg play smooth no problam .mobile look and fell osmmm.

"
"

  Very Good phone in this budget.Nice get up.phone quality,battery back up awsome.This white colors fells good.Quad camera quality are awsme.....Enjoy it...

"
"

  Bkwas phone totally don't buy, this phone its over weighted phone , and over price camera quality very bad 8 mp only ,and price 14000  , better than u can go for realme 3 pro , redmi note 8 , honor 8x , honor 20i, ...etc.😒

"
"

  Camera is up to mark with exchange price of mine at 8 k but not worth of for 14 k price. Battery backup is almost good for a day use of normal (without accessing high games)  .

"
"

  i just bought it 6 hours agocamera quality is not even descent.it doesn't even supports google payadd 2k more to your budget and you can get something better  buy this phone on your own risk.

"
"

  Bought for 7k with exchangeReviewing after one monthBattery backup is good compared to my old device Moto e5 plus.Dual Speakers r of very good quality.Dolby surround is awesome.Camera clearity is just ok.C type charge supports little fast charging.Build quality is good.Better to buy with exchange.

"
"

  The best value phone at this price. I was sceptical about its camera quality..but the camera clicks decent pictures. I exchanged my xiomi redmi 7A and got it for 7200. Trust me it's worth every penny. It is quite smooth, good display and great sound quality. Build quality is quite solid. Highly satisfied at this price...pics attached for your reference guys.

"
"

  The Battery life is wonderful, it last's two day's in standard use, no gaming. The UI lag's some times, but I can tolerate that, but when it comes to the both side camera's it's avarage, not a good one and also absolutely not a better one !! Details are so low!!!! But other things are good. Considering the price point it's a avarage choise.

"
"

  The product is very bad. It hangs a lot and I have bought 1 month ago. I can't imagine so dirty product in terms of phone lag.I would recommend no one to buy this phone.I want replacement for this phone at any costIt would be great OPPO can replace my phone as I have purchased recently one month ago.They have fooled us badly.

"
"

  As I heard of, that Oppo phone near are good,same I foundTough quality with white color..apprantly seems uniqueFast charging support, 5000 mah charged in 1 hour+ time.C type pin never fails or damage- it is my one day review only, but looking it is best phone I purchased..

"
"

  I was looking for good mobile and finally in doubt I bought this though i was already using Oppo brand....And seriously I got love with this mobileIf u r looking for some mobiles below 15K then this may meet your needs....Camera 4.5/5Fingerprint 5/5Battery life 5/5

"
"

  Excellent phone, nice features, great pics, nice specs

"
"

  MOBILE IS GETTING HANG 3THRICE IN A DAY AND CAN NOT WORK FOR 30 MIN WHEN HANG

"
"

  Very nice and hardy phone... But charging pin is different than other smart phones... Made in india... Thats make very satisfied to me

"
"

  I was tried Redmi 9 on flash sales but no luck and I hated flash sale :) I bought this phone but no regret, it works as expected I liked.

"
"

  A good choice mobile in tight budget segment Decent camera,Good battery life and sound quality only drawback i found i.e, fast charging..

"
"

  dear sir / madam,please note that we recieved the mobile phone today  morning .but please note that unfortunately there ois no headphones provided .pleases take action on the following  .

"
"

  Network LockThis phone has Network Lock. This can be used only in India. After writing so many mail to customer service, there was no one to solve the issue. But they give only false hope.If you are a frequent traveller, get it solved before leaving India. I ended up with buying a new phone in my destination.

"
"

  please return or replace this delivery product today . very poor camera quality . Worthless . I am not getting return option

"
"

  I have got this phone with exchange Mi4 ₹ 7.6K.Delivery is very fast, happy to shopping with amezon.Oppo A5 2020 good phone.camera and battery quality is good,classic finished, excellent features... happy...***

"
"

  Excellent mobile from OPPO.picture quality is  excellent.worth to purchase the 4/64 mobile with quad cam.Huge battery of 5000maH,which is long losting.As compared to other peers ,this mobile is the best.

"
"

  Order delivered fast. But not happy with oroduct. It gets heat enough. Battery drains very fast. Hangs and reboot auto between 2 to 6 hrs.Talk to amazon they said if technician says then only it will replace. They have scheduled technician at monday.

"
"

  Good looking phones with average quality camera and performance, but dual speaker sound is impressive.... But its price (comparing to its features offered) is high.

"
"

  Poor camera and build quality.Pathetic display. Very heavy.Only plus is the battery. Not very suitable for gaming.

"
"

  First time ordered it was not working. Apps were not working n touch screen issues got it replaced still faced same issue. Got it remotely checked by amozon technical team so found ter is issue with the phone so got it cancelled n waiting for refund

"
"

  Excellent product. Worth it.  Continue to provide best services like this. Best wishes for your image development.👌👍

"
"

  12MP+8MP+2MP+2MP this is nothing but a worst camera quality. Oppo is famous with good camera quality but now a days they are cheating customers with the name of good camera.

"
"

  Awesome👍 product.Battry is awesome😊👏But not a fast charging 🔋⚡3 hr. To full charge from 15 %Camera is awesome in this bujet.Value of mony.Thanks to amezon for fast डैल्वेरी।

"
"

  Though it's purchased for my aunt, camera battery Dolby atmos and UI are pretty good.If u are a camera lover go for it undoubtedly best and no issues of lagging

"
"

  the reason this phone is so high on specs and low on price is because Oppo has integrated advertisement popup on various random apps, so if you are okay with that its very good phone, also camera is average despite having 4 cam setup on the back.

"
"

  ProsBig bright displayGood ram managementNo heating issuesNo adsCon'sCamera quality poorNo fast chargingNo android10Non full HD display

  Duel speaker sounds quality superbest Dolby Atmos

  Good mobile in budget...Sound quality 👌👌👌Battery blackup superbCamera 👌Overall value for money product

"
"

  Smooth screen ....good fingerprint sences, good camera clarity...but at night a little blur images...but that's ok

"
"

  Sound Quality & battery is very good, camera quality is average, software slow. This is only for Normal user. Color & build quality is good.

"
"

  Take is taken to full charge time,10 to 100 percentage more than 3 hrs time, when I opened my new phone it is getting hang and apps r opened not fast,so my opinion is not a gud phone

"
"

  Amazing product and great camera quality stylish look

"
"

  Regarding Parcel - Worst &  Poor Packing., Missing headphone.About phone : Average. Takes long time to charge and over heating. Compare to this OPPO A5 2020 my 3yrs old Moto G5 plus is 1000 times better. My suggestion is to buy MOTOROLA product.

"
"

  Thanks for delivery within 24 hoursOverall good phone camera quality struggles in low light and have slow image processing so i suggest you if you are a normal user buy 3gb varient, if you are a havey user then spend more money and consider other products thank you.

"
"

  Camera is extreme bad.I have oppo a37f and it has better camera quality than oppo A5 2020.Disappointing mobile.It has1.Bad camera.2.Bad display.3.unsatisfactory performance.4.High price as compared to phone quality.5.Non hd display

"
"

  Not as expected, the phone lags. I have not installed heavy Apps or Games. This is the first I went for oppo, a bit disappointed.

"
"

  Value for Money Quad Camera Phone and looks stunning as well. Only draw back is the heavyness of the device but it is what now generation phone are weighing.

"
"

  Excellent phone in an affordable price... just luv it...good features. Good camera. Earphones also available

"
"

  A superb budget phone. Got it for Rs 8250/- after exchange of my old phone. For that price, the phone is really satisfactory. Camera is good and the battery life is excellent. Overall very happy with oppo A5 2020.

"
"

  One of the best phone ever bought by me. Review after one year of use

"
"

  Best mobile at this price.... good working..  if night mode is also included in this mobile,  then it will be more  awesome...

"
"

  Yesterday I got my Oppo A5 2020, as per details it was mentioned that in box headset is also available but after delivery it was found there is no headset. Sound quality of headset from other companies are not good with Oppo A5 2020.

"
"

  Fingerprint reader working too fast.Battery life is duriable.Camera quality is good.Overall I think that this phone is good for this price.;

"
"

  WITHIN 2 MONTHS THE PHONES GETS HUNG EVERYDAY AT-LEAST 5-10 TIMES(WHEN I TRY TO UNLOCK)PATHETIC PRODUCT I NEVER SEEN.I STRONGLY RECOMMENDS NOT TO BUY THIS STUPID PRODUCT.

"
"

  I bought for my mom....only for the battery and big screen are really fantastic..battery life is very good... Where she can watch serial on her mobile.. Enough for her 4gb ram and 64 inbulit... Camera is ok... Fingerprint is slightly slower... Need fast and quick...

"
"

  I just bought this phone and found everything great about it except one thing - size of the phone. I wish I could get the same configuration in a phone with size of around 5"" and that too should be pocket friendly.

"
"

  The mobile is so good. I have not expected such good camera quality and was confused between Red Mi and Oppo. But after using Oppo, i can say I have made a good decision by buying Oppo.Delivery was so fast, i got phone within 24 hour of order.So overall good experience.

"
"

  Nice phone and good display.dolby sound is awesome. Battery is amazing.worth buying.

"
"

  Camera quality at night is very bad,battery life is good but it does not support fast charging and display is hd+ not full HD+ but it's ok sound is amazing Dolby atom is good .overall  good but camera is bed

"
"

  The battery is standing for 36hrs after full charging. But the charger is not fast charger. Camera quality is ok

"
"

  All good gamming performance good free fire pubg lite handling nice pubg mobile I am not playing camera normal mode worst go to camera setting ultra hd camera mode available this mode photo quality good sound superb battery full charge time 2h 30 min. No heat mobile not bad good mobile

"
"

  I liked the overall quality of the mobile.. Battery backup is superb. Display, processor, speed, are well balanced with the performance of the device.. But camera quality could have been better.. I was expecting better quality cameras.. But they are OK... At this price... Design and looks are elegant, attractive... Everyone loved it...

"
"

  Best phone in this range ..my wife big fan of oppo. Look wise very nice ...i bought this phone for my wife,,batry is good..camera quality better than other phone like,, redmi or realme..bcz last time i was used redmi 6 pro.....

"
"

  Excellent product @ this budget price point. Build is solid, interface is smart for ease of use. Its a good buy...

"
"

  It's camera and build quality is very bad compare to other manufacturers and again this cost more than those product. I don't understand why they make such bad products and price is also fluctuate a lot. I buy it at 12500 and now this is available at 10990. So this twice before buying this.

"
"

  Great value for maney owsom camera,awsome music,display quality is far better than redmi mobile and other mobile included samsung for this budget range total value for maney

"
"

  Dealer not good......headphone mation on box, but headphone not availabe in box.

"
"

  Good Budget phone within 15k

"
"

  The phone is sooo good at processing and back camera is awesome! But I dont like the front camera 👎 it's not as much as I expected..battery is good..its fast charging..worth buying thz mobile !👍 Some times it hangs idk why 👎  other than that its so niz with all the futures

"
"

  Mobile is good in this price range ,except camera performance. So many cameras are there but picture quality is not good.

"
"

  Very good phone in this range, only blemish in fast charging is missing..was expected in 2020 model after having set the bar high with fast charging...still other features are top notch!!

  Comes with factory fitted tampered glass,  immediately you can do android 10 with color 7.1 update, takes 2 hours for full charging,  it comes to 24 hours with moderate usage.  Cons.. camera is over hyped,  and  internet disconnection observed occasionally

"
"

  No, dislikes only likes, so for it's good .we are using for online study purpose mainly. Finger print reader added a extra privacy, camera & battery life is excellent. Totally good choice for the online study and general purpose too

"
"

  Worth for price..camera lens perfect...Sound effect is tremendous..Headphone inbuilt🥰..Back case inbuit😃..Battery life perfect..Highly valuable...

"
"

  Worst phone it drains the battery very fast battery is defective.and the headphone jack is also defective doesn't connect any headphone .dont waste mony for these phone.Amazon service is also the worst if the phone having replace policy they doesn't replace it .

"
"

  A budget smartphoneWith great processorExcellent gaming (PUBG)Superb camera features with great clarityFast Fingerprint with face unlockDolby Atmos sound systemAnd fast charging compared with 18watt vivo charger

"
"

  Well this is one of the best budget mobile with good build quality and features.

"
"

  High performance, happy to use the next generation specifications. Really more than the money spent

"
"

  No problems until now. The only thing that disappoints is the camera quality. The marketing shows that camera is good and all but it’s not.Otherwise the phone is good as per the price

"
"

  It is Good For House wife women,Who doesn't have gaming interest.Battery life is very excellent. Back camera is some have better and fornt camera is disappointed. Charging also some delay.

"
"

  Very nice mobile.we can say that it is value for money mobile . Battery life is good.. I play freefire that after it give me a backup of 1 day. And without playing game it give me 2 days back up .so battery is excellent.Camera is good but not excellent.

"
"

  Very nice smart phone and big screen size looking very hot also in budget

"
"

  Camera seems ok for normal photography.Should provide fast charger takes too long about 2-3 hours for full charge.. battery backup is good full day with full charge and about 30% left end of the day.

"
"

  when I ordered it  I thought that it will not give me that type of performance but seriously I just loved it. The color is also fab. and the camera quality is also good but not the best I think. Overall I only say that just go for it

"
"

  Good Mobile. I was the Redmi user before this mobile. Compared to redmi, oppo's quality particularly this mobile is not up to the level. Overall it is good mobile but not very good.

"
"

  Very good facial unlocking. Works fast and even in dim lights. Huge battery.

"
"

  Awesome battery life. Camera is not up to mark. Everything is ok.

"
"

  Product was as detailed... But the sreen protector was scratched and there were multiple cracks on the screen protector of the mobile... Completely unpredicted from Amazon.

"
"

  Everything are awesome. Sound quality are superb, double Dolby sound.

"
"

  Received defect item, requested for replacement. Tear at the bottom of screen. Is it really a Gorilla glass ?, Company claims it is Gorilla glass but i dont think so.Product is good.

"
"

  I bought OPPP A5 after doing lot of research.ProsBattery back up,Good performance, Not tried big games thoughCons:No Notification lightThis is good phone in this segment. we can go for it.

"
"

  There is a defect in the screen. A technician is expected to visit in 2 days and check if it's eligible for replacement. Will update then

"
"

  Too much heating issue and no battery backup i was return this product 2 time

"
"

  Product is good and received with good conditions. Delivery boy is also cooperative ..got my product as per my conveinient time and place.  Thanks for providing delivery boy z contact number which is very much helpful for the customer.. Thanks and regards

"
"

  Camera quality good battery life good not for gaming you can’t play pubg . Pubg lite lack in this device without gameplay mobile is value of money

"
"

  Value for money phnCamera quality is good not very good.Battery is awesomeLook by dhasu

"
"

  Good phone but they didn't provide earphones nice battery good display but poor camera performance good gift for parents ☺️ pubg performance is awesome and Dolby Atmos gives better feel in music thanks oppo for this beautiful phone.

"
"

   Nice product all are ok but camera quality upgrade much more and main importan a fablous head phone is in the box and a quality back cover this phone act as a dolby speeker. Speeker quality very good

"
"

  Renewed product, because its screen has no proper finish at its edge, I compare it with another set of same onba mobile shope. U r cheater Amazon!!

"
"

  Camera would hav been better.Battery life is good but no fast charging a let down.Sound is good.No earphones.

"
"

  Too good vs price or can say unbelievable phone at this price 11990.👍👍

"
"

  * Fingerprint reader goes sometimes 2/5 🌟* 🔋 Life better' 3/5 🌟 although having 5000mAh* Camera quality 4/5 🌟

"
"

  Very good mobile. It is value for money. OPPO camera quality is also good as well as battery life. I recommended to buy this phone if u go for this range of budget.

"
"

  Best value for money mobile phone. Everything in a nice package. Camera would have been a little better but at this price point nothing better can be expected. Overall good buy.

"
"

  I gifted it to my mom as birthday gift...she really felt happy. Features, speed,power backup, look is what she needs and this phone really caters all her needs.

"
"

  A good phone in this budget, I bought this for my maid, a good phone and value for money.

"
"

  Best phone in it's budget comes with Android pie and really good camera it's better than my 25000 phone which I bought 2 months before it.

"
"

  LOOKS WISE TO GOOD, Camera & Battery is also good.. I like it.. superb phone in this budget.👌👌🤗

"
"

  I've purchased Oppo first time and I would say This is the best phone.Camera Quality better than Mi and Battery performance is also good,Specially it's Back design is too good.This phone is little be costally against Xioami but honestly this is the best.

"
"

  Great phone

"
"

  Oral best in price good mobile build quality in very good

"
"

  I am not expected the sound quality of Dolby atoms' I am enjoy to hear the songs to this OPPO A5 device. Overall this device is best in this price range. This one device  is my best choice. Thanks to Amazon and Appario.

"
"

  Fingerprint reader is small in size hence take some time to search , performance is good 4.5*Battery is also Good 4.5*Camera in low light some improvement required 4.0*

"
"

  Phone touch is very bad , Very Slow responding....not user friendly.....no notification lights....it's just in 2 days only

"
"

  The look of the phone is goodBut when it comes to charging it take more than a hourThe camera as such is not goodAnd sound quality is also not lowOverall it doesn't value for money

"
"

  Good product but the front camera is very very poor. Back is alright with flash.Looks wise amazing phone. Battery life good too. Buy it if you're not a huge fan of selfies and can compromise on camera.

"
"

  Oppo, camera phone.Worst quality of camera.Very bad experience with oppo A5 2020.Please, friends don't buy it,  go with samsung.

"
"

  The phone is good but the camara quality should be more of it will be increased the phone is excelentI have booked another phone because the phone superbAll should purchase it

"
"

  It does what it said 👍Proudly, Indian 🇮🇳✨

"
"

  most of the phone are not available.By lots of research i choose this phone from all which are available on amazon.big battery life, Big display, good processor, Best sound quality, overall a good phone.

"
"

  finger print and camera is good.Phone looks is actually good.Battery performance is good but charging system is not good.I connect the plug with phone after 1 hours charging this phone is hot.why????

"
"

  My marks: Finger print sensor  -3.5/5 Battery life - 4/5 Camera quality- 3/5 Sound quality -Dolby sound not bad - 4/5 Display- average -3.5/5 Video quality - Not satisfactory- 3/5

"
"

  Very disappointing...headset missing in the package Inspite of declaring that there will be headset in the package...

"
"

  Do not waste your money in it.Facing charging issue within 15 days and now visiting oppo  service centre on daily basis but issue not resolved yet. Now saying wait for 1 week to change some part in the phone.

"
"

  It's a good mobile in this price.Go for it

"
"

  Wrost camera but if you ignore camera quality then go for it during this lockdown situation.

"
"

  I have bought two phones one for me one for my sister however when I went Tunisia both phones didn't detect foreign sim card .I need to unlock network using code that only the retail shop has it not able to contact you

"
"

  Lovely mobile

"
"

  Camera is very gud with some special features like...night mode,ultrawide,slow Mo,and for both front n back camera potrait mode is available...easy to use... definitely I would suggest to go for it... without any hesitation.♥️

"
"

"
"

"
"

"
"

  Notification senser not available in this phoneBattery quality not so goodCharging speed very slowPhone heating problem alsoThis is bad experience for me regarding oppo A52020 phone

"
"

  Fingerprint reader, battery life,camera quality is good...but i want to ask u why it heats while charging.. it heats too much why ??

"
"

  First time experience dolby-atmos😍. And i love it. Although a perfect smartphone at 12k. Battery life super, display looks awesome, phone look damn good in white, only the thing missing is Fast charging.

"
"

  It's really worth for 12,000 guys. No heating issues, pubj can play 1.30 hours without any heating ,lagging. With quadcamera, sd665 processer,dolby Atmos speaker for this was awesome deal. Don't miss it🤗

"
"

  Value for money . After using I would like to give this phone 5 Stars. Detail Review is :Touch - very smoothBattery - AwesomePerformance- Very Good after using all typical apps

"
"

  Device is awesome. Camera is good, battery is good.

"
"

  Good at this price point with a processor of SD665.

"
"

  All things are excellent expect camera could have been better

"
"

  Phone has hanging prob. And suddenly phone stopped workingSome times its lock not openBut look is pretty good..Battery life is better than other but chargig time is too long

"
"

  I am posting my review after the use of 2 months,so honestly telling mobile working very very well in all aspects specially its dolby sound & signal strength is decent enough but still rate should be under 10k.

"
"

  I don't know yet but I think this is budget friendly.Don't believe if anyone says battery will get charged within 1&half an hour.. believe me battery takes 3 hours to complete charge.

"
"

  The camera quality is average, battery life is good, UI is excellent but the price is bit higher in comparison with other phones available in 13K

"
"

  It is not supporting indian language.if i select other country english language,then indian date format is not supporting in ms excel app

"
"

  All ok but camera not ok speaker good display ok

"
"

  Everything is awesome from oppo.The best part is the stereo sound with dual speakers. It's too smooth ..Doesn't feel like 3 gm ram ..It's too fast ..Good work oppo

"
"

  Excellent phone, the sound of the phone is awesome and the battery life is awesome, satisfied with the product

"
"

  Good, using since 2 months,no problem at all.

"
"

  Better to wait some time and buy good phoneIts battery backup is so badIf you spend extra 1000 rupee you can buy redmi note 9 which consists 48mp ai quad camera with 5000 mah battery

"
"

  Best smartphone in budget , camera quality is also very nice , fingerprint is also fast and good and it's gaming performance is also smooth and goodI loved this phone ❤️

"
"

  Good product

"
"

  Perfomance is very bad....I suggest never buy this phone ....hate this product ....it have no return policy also ....they are making fool to us ...by selling this type of product ....

"
"

  Phone design is superb also the phone functionality easily User friendly.but camera not that much quality also phone hanging whenni took photot it's loading 3secs then only can take next photo

"
"

  Phone is amazing video playback excellent and sound. I never feel hd screen look like full hd screen

"
"

  Meet the expectations. Fingerprint reader is not that accurate. But ok it's good. Camera is above average. Battery life is excellent. Speakers are also very good.Overall good mobile for the price of 11k.

"
"

"
"

  In the description headset was included but  there is no headset in my mobile box..please rectify this type of issues

"
"

  Very slow software. Apps are taking too much time to start. Hanging problem always. Heating issue.

"
"

  Phone is good. I am not sure whether it is 5000 mAH battery or 3000 mAH because battery is draining very quickly cant be use full day even after charging 100%.Camera quality is excellent.

"
"

  I bought it for one of my friend, he told me the mobile is good and he liked very much......

"
"

  Worst mobile from the starting only mobile is struck and no proper resolution done yet.Dont go for this mobile.

"
"

  I am happy with the product but the selfie cam could have been better. You can get this phone for a price range from 8,000-9,000. Don't get this phone for the actual price.

"
"

  It is good mobile but oppo should sell this mobile 9k.

"
"

  Good phone from oppo. Excellent camera and battery life. My father is using it for 1 months and he is liking it very much. Dazzling white is best color variant. Go for it.

"
"

  No option for a Screen lock pattern & it's only showing fingerprint & face option ,, fingerprint option not working properly & screen double tap option also not there in this mobile very bad

  No where on the site it is mentioned that  3gb variant has no headphone  ,  oppo is cheating by not  mentioning this on product page  . Amazon is sitting silent on this issue  .

"
"

  Finger print ok battery okCamera quality, average, and display from other mob oppo

"
"

  What is like is : i had buy it in exchange offer.The major cons: I found its heavy and not slim.

  The mobile phone is excellent but the earplugs doesn't came with it asper it's price it should either give earplugs otherwise the phone should support the fast charger

"
"

  Phone is good..but missing headphones.in my box.. little disappointed.

"
"

  Not so good not so bad. It's okay price is towards very higher side.

"
"

  When I received this then I found that it's Mike and speaker is not working.Then I returned it.

"
"

  Overall the phone is good but the facial recognition is not so good... It takes multiple attempts to open for facial recognition... Rest all is good

"
"

  Performance ok good for free fire normal for pubg cam quality is below average i byed 4gb phn is 10800 its average phn for ths rate

"
"

  Blue line on screen

"
"

"
"

  The range in which this phone is, is quite good and its look attracts a lot of people.

"
"

  Budget phone.Looks great. Performance is good, display is fantastic.Only thing is the camera is a little sluggish and grainy especially in low light environments.

"
"

  ☺

  Worst camera. Looks like a 2 megapixel photo.Look, feel and battery backup is goodThe gaming experience is decent.

  Before buying you must know the difference between 7k mobile and 10k to 15K Mobiles .Reason for choosing this title earlier i used a pro version model , Now i am reviewing this model after 3 days of usage.1. Ear speaker quality in outdoor's very poor  . Keep your headphones handy ,2.Sensor's are not working properly ( this is the reason i choose this title , sensor quality is based on price )3.App search option is not available  , you must be very patient to search required app when you have an urgent need , you have to swipe all your mobile to choose required app . or change the launcher . default launcher is not capable of doing this basic function .Rest all other functions are good  .

"
"

   Worst phone ever. Don't buy ths phone.heating issue at the bottom side of touch screen, touch button as well as ghost touch activates on its own within 1-2 minutes and you can not use any of the app properly.Initially thought it may be a due to some kind of virus, even after company reset issue is there and also you can see screen flickering very easily.

"
"

  This is my 4th MI Phone in 3 years. Earlier ones were good.But here The extra battery has made phone heavier and hence has lost it charm, now looks like chinese phone. Earlier ones were as good as other phone apart from brand.Not recommended.Would love to return but it was gift for family,

"
"

  I bought this for an older relative who needed a basic smartphone. Given its pricepoint I didn't have much expectations for the Redmi 8A but after unboxing and setting it up I have to admit - it looks and behaves like a premium phone!In almost every aspect 8A has been upgraded over the 7A. While it doesn't have a fingerprint sensor, the camera is much better than I expected. There is a bit of lag in opening and switching between multiple applications but it shouldn't be a big deal for people with basic usage patterns. To facilitate better grip, 8A has a non-glassy back that is textured. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by the phone given its pricepoint. For its target demographic (light users who might just want to take some pics, use social media and the occasional app) this is a great phone.The only drawback I felt is that Xiaomi has been aggressive in bundling custom apps in the phone that deliver lots of ads and sponsored videos by default (and it requires some know-how to disable them).

"
"

  Mobile is good at this priceBut when I was using hotspot and screen recording the mobile became overheated it hanged so i switch off it.In this range mobile is really good..

  We are highly unsatisfied with the product .There is performance issue with the phone in which the touch ,speed as well as the processor is very slow.It does not worth the money and the sound quality is also low.The battery also gets drained very early though it is of 5000 mAH.We have mailed a return request but they have not taken any action.I need to return this phone and want a new phone as soon as possible.

"
"

  The phone hangs a lot. Processor is too slow. Apps close on their own. Can't ecen listen yo music continuously.

"

  Defective display (minor scratch) on the scratch and there is now way i can return / service / request replacement.

  Top smartphone in this priceEXCELLENCE camera , great display

"
"

  I purchased this phone in Feb. 2020  from Amazon site and now it's May 2020 and  I find it difficult to swipe it open after the display goes on sleep mode.  So this is the status it's touch mechanism within 3 months.  So one has to be careful about buying cheap quality Redmi phones as the touch mechanism may not be of good quality..

"
"

  Nice design,heavy, gr8 display size , camera quality poor, battery capacity excellentGood price for these features

"
"

  Phone is good, no finger print reader, but price is disappointingBecause it is launched at a price of 6499 now see the price

"
"

  The phone has many pros and some cons.The cons are :Speaker sound is not that good.Sound with bluetooth headphone ,earphone is not good.Equalizer can not be used in case of bluetooth headsets, earphones.There should be a 4 ,64 gb variant.There are some MI apps which can not be uninstalled.Camera is ok, medium quality.

"

   From 12 the day it is not working. Mi service center re installed the software but still it is not working

"

  Redmi 8A Dual (Sea Blue, 3GB RAM)Battery: The smartphone comes with a 5000 mAH battery. For an average user, this is great.OS: The preinstalled OS Android 9 with MIUI Global 11.0.2. user interface.OS Volume Bug: There is a bug which constantly causes volume to drop to zero. You can fix this bug by System Update.Camera: Pretty decent camera. There are already too many reviews on this, so I'm not gonna comment.Bloatware: Probably, this is what bugs me most in android devices. There are bunch of preinstalled apps and games. Most of them are unnecessary for you. You can remove most of them but not all. This is pathetic.RAM Usage: After removing bloatwares, the system takes around 1.1 GB of RAM, so you will have 1.9 GB of RAM which is enough for the most users.No Heating Issue: I'm not a gamer, but if you are an average you will not find any heating issue, at least most of the time.

"
"

  I was purchased Redmi 8A on.  19/02/2020,  but received phone is defective,  i was already registered my complain, but Amazon not postive response.

"
"

  I wasted my money on this phone,Phone hang a lot and all functions start working automatically and iam not able to restart the phone. So at that time I have to wait for 20 30mints.I demand product replacement or refund plz.

"
"

  I was a little sceptical while purchasing this phone as it was my first Chinese phone as I was fed up with my mom's rough phone usage! She successfully killed many good brand phones like HTC, Samsung etc so wanted something really cheap this time. I paid 7500 for this phone even though the old price was 6500! Due to lockdown, I had no option to roam around! The best part was I got 3100Rs for old Samsung J4 in exchange with no mess, whereas local shopkeepers were talking about 1k resale value lol! That was less than year old phone though but still, I was happy with buyback price so went ahead and decided to buy this phone even though there are plenty of negative reviews!Now coming to the phone I didn't feel like I'm holding some entry-level Chinese phone! It's a great phone for ladies who use phone just for WhatsApp and calling. No problems found so far. The battery is excellent. Colour is catchy. The best part is Type C slot as all other phones in my home have Type C! Best phone for basic users. Not for Pro. I own LG G7, Oneplus etc so I know what premium means! So I won't call it premium but it's definitely worth a try! Consider the life of a couple of years and proceed as even branded entry-level phones die sooner or later. It's been only 2 days so can't say much about it. If there seems to be any problem I'll update my review.

"
"

  Pros:*Cool battery*Type c charger and fast charging*Corning Gorilla glass 5(toughness)*Splashproof*Wireless FMCons:*Too many pre-installed unwanted apps which would kill internal storage and ram space*No private safe, but covered with second space. (Hide option is provided for folder as a whole, not for individual file/image. That too without password protection!! Too bad*processor performance is not great but good.*presence of Finger print sensor would be great*Both the cameras are too bad.. would feel like having 5 mp camera.*Weights heavy due to 5k battery

"
"

   My review for Seller Appario :2nd ViDEO :DEFECTIVE PIECE: Mobile is misbehaving... suddenly clicking on any/many app... ""WITHOUT TOUCHING ON SCREEN""... suddenly opening Gmail... suddenly opening SMS and start typing... very sad...

"
"

  Missing fingerprint sensor but nice phone with nice design

"
"

  I bought this phone for my dad.Pros:good battery lifelarge screenlook and feel is nicecamera is good for its priceCons:THIS HANDSET IS MADE IN CHINAI thought it is Redmi (made in India), but it is made by Xiomi.Does not have fingerprint scanner.

"
"

  It is fantastic phone for you if you are a normal user and not  a gamer . But unfortunately I received the handset is defective (I dont know that other have faced it or not) . In some app like BHIM UPI it shows the device is rooted. You can not oparate may app in rooted device . So please make sure that if your device same problem . If yes then mark my review as helpful. Thak me latter.

"
"

  Service is good but........

"
"

  Cons:1. Very bad camera. Selfie camera is not even enough for video calling.2. Performance is not up to mark with 3gb RAM.3. Heating problem with extensive usage of internet or gaming.4. Many unnecessary apps which cannot be removed are impacting performance.Pros:1. Very good battery life.2. Nice display and well built.3. Budget phone.Overall, it is a budget smartphone with less smartness. Lot of notifications which are unable to remove with many unnecessary apps in OS.

"
"

  Cons: No fingerprint sensor.No Widevine L1 support.Not a good camera at all. Photos captured are blurry and unclear. Totally disappointed with the camera.Too many MI built in apps which reduces the usable memory in hand.Pros: Premium quality design.Feels good in hand.Corning Gorilla Glass 5.Type C port.Fast charging.Dedicated Memory Card slot expandable upto 512 GB.Super Class Audio Speakers. Sound is very good. Listening music is very much enjoyable.Not heating up while charging.Display not bad at all.All in all a good phone at this price range.

"
"

  I have purchased 8A dual but its not a good product ,i have buy many product from amazon but i havent recevied such a bab product these phone camera is not good & get blink any while opening app..& phone get swtich off..while video call camera is not stable i request you to change the product & refund the money asap...i m not happy with this product..these issue i m facing from 1 month..

"
"

  When I receive this item it was 63% charge then I put charge after two hours it get only 68% only then I put whole night charge next day morning it get only 80% charge.. I totally disappointed..After that I returned this item then I received new mobile when I opened I directly put into charge, I get the same issue I don't what a do.. what they are doing I don't know they not checks properly and not inspected.. I really upset this service..

"
"

  In this price segment this is the worst mobile I have used yet. Camera is above average not best, there is a big issue in this phone is network and wifi connection issue.Phone automatically disconnected wifi connection all the time and network is also very weak comparing to other mobiles. One big issue I found today that touch is working automatically. And there is another problem with Amazon to replace the phone that now I have to post the phone to Amazon then they will send a new phone.Third class performance

"
"

  First  of  all I would like to say,""IT IS THE BEST PHONE UNDER ₹10,000""....*GOOD Selfie and Rear cameras at this price.*FAST CHARGING*GOOD PERFORMANCE*STYLISH EXTERNAL DESIGNS*BEST SPEAKERS*BEST FOR PLAYING GAMES LIKE FREEFIRE ,PUBG etc...(but You should play with Standard Graphics otherwise occurs a heating issue )*NO FINGERPRINT FACILITY*NO EARPHONES AVAILABLE WITH THE PHONE*PREVENT THE DEVICE FROM RUNNING IN LOW SPACE other wise There will be a Lag iSsue..

"
"

  First off all it is a good product for this price. Good looking and smooth. But..The camera is too cheap that it is a waste having dual camera for this quality. May be it's software issue.And IT LACK A FINGER PRINT SENSORbut HAVE FACE UNLOCK INSTEAD,it is pretty good.The phone is LITTLE BIT BULKY may be because of 5000mAh battery pack.Anyway it's is good as a budget phone

"
"

  The phone comes with a 6.22-inch touchscreen display with a resolution of 720x1520 pixels and an aspect ratio of 19:9. The Redmi 8A Dual runs Android 9.0 and is powered by a 5000mAh battery.The phone is a bit heavier though compare to the other ones. And sometimes it gets over heated.Overall, it's an affordable phone with a very reasonable amount of money.

"
"

  Defective product received as with many other users. The phone has ghost touch problem. This seems to be the issue with this phone model and also in general with Redmi phones as is apparent from several online forums. Since I only noticed this problem after the return period was over, Amazon wasn't ready to extend any support on this. The problem has only aggravated since and the phone now dials numbers  or opens apps on its own. For the first time in my life, I have faced a hardware issue with a brand new phone. Redmi QC seems to be very lax. Now I need to take it to the service centre. It is really annoying to send a new product for servicing and be left without a phone after spending your hard earned money.

"
"

  Excellent mobile to use... Bought for my father and he loved it as he starts to use it.Big battery lasts longer.Excellent display, vibrant colours presentation, nice photos and videos, up to the mark... Thanks Amazon for perfect package and delivery on time.From company side in the box, No screen guard and no mobile pouch provided.

  • Camera Quality is acceptable (Don't expect much quality).• Not a gaming processor. (Snapdragon 439)• No fingerprint reader.• Face Unlock is present.• Out of the box type-c charger is present.• Correct fit in hand.• Gives a good inhand feel.• We can play some heavy games in it (PUBG is included).• Excellent Display.• Dual 4G support is there.• 2.5 hours charging time (20% to 100%).

"
"

  The mobile phone is best option for those user that needs good battery backup. Beautiful looking mobile. Type C charging port but charger supplied with this mobile is 2 mAh type C Charger.

"
"

  It's working fineBest phone in this rangeLooking for I was looking for a phone under 8000 for my younger brother as he was having very tight budget so I search many phone went to market in the market offline this phone was being sold about 8500 but I got on Amazon in 7500 only you can see it is available on Flipkart another platform over 8000Other alternative of his phone in the same range having low quality processor and no gorilla glass screen c type charging in this range you cannot find anywherePhone has premium looks

  1. Battery Life is Good - Lasted for 1.5 days on one charge2. Full Charge took 1 Hour which is ok for 5000 MAH Battery3. Mobile is a little heavier due to battery4. The phone did not heat up though used continuouslyGood Buy at the offered priceImprovement Areas1. AI Camera is not that fast2. Already MI Security Patch is released and takes 1.7 GB of data for update, No problem for wifi users but heavy on cellular networks3. Lot of adds and push notifications, Disable them4. Camera Quality fair enough for this Price, Dont expect super trendy clarity5. Always notifies to update the built in apps all the time, they will work though not updated.

  Fast charger not given in box of productThis is not a made in India productSo don't buy thisInstant this product buy Honour 9S mobile which is latest Android and features loaded alsoThank you

  Best budjet smartphone from redmiIt worth my money Excellent smartphone 👍🔥💥Thank you Amazon and XioamiThe most interesting thing is you get 5000 mh battery in this budjet.But redmi should add fingerprint scanner in this smartphoneBut overall the phone is Good

"

  Great phone and you will get all the high end phone trending (gestures, raise to wake, dark mode and much more) customizations with miui11.People who are not willing to spend a fortune on the devices can easily upgrade to this one.For daily usage beats all categories.Love it.

  Placed for return! Still not sure when my return will be processed! Amazon Customer service is closed!The adapter of charger DIDNT WORKSOFTWARE FAILURE IS THERE! Identified and reported the very next day of purchase!

  My mom’s been using this for around a month now. It looks great, and found no issues yet.Tbh, display is too big. If you like big screen phones then go for it. Go for the 3GB RAM version, since 2GB one is too slow.Display: 5/5 (No issues at all)Sound: 3.5/5 (It’s loud but not that great)Camera: 3.5/5 (Dual cameras but photos are not at good)Battery: 5/5 (My mom doesn’t use it that much, so battery lasts up to 3-4 days easily)Quality: 5/5 (It’s plastic but the built is nice)Overall: 4/5 (Works out great for my mom at this price. Satisfied)

"
"

  Bought this for my father who is 75 years old, suggested by my son who is 15 years old. Both of them are impressed for different reasons. Father, for the light weight and non-slippery hold, son, for the speed, camera quality and sturdiness. I am happy because it is value for money. Overall, a great deal for first time users.

  This is one of the cheap smartphone according to its features.Battery capacity is amazingCamera is ok not so good.Two things I dislike about this Phone that it is made in China not only mobile, adapter is also made in China and the second thing is 10w charger is given in this box we have to purchase separately.Sound quality is clear and too lound I liked this also.Overall I like this Phone.Note: We have to use invoice as a warrenty card to claim our warrentybecause Warrenty Card is not separately given inside the box. So I request the seller to give invoice in good condition to customers because I have not received invoice in good condition.  (For those customers who have written ""Warrenty Card is not given"" in their review and for the seller).Hope this will help.Thank you.

  I purchased Redmi 8A Dual on 27th July 2020. It has 7 days return policy. After 15 days the phone was switched off automatically and after several trying phone did not power on. I go to the redmi authorized service center for servicing of the mobile phone. They tell me that the phone was water damaged. Due to this I did not get any warranty. But they did not open the mobile in front of me for checking.  Worst quality of phone I ever seen and worst quality of service center they have.

"
"

  Not a good product. Took it to service center. First they changed software. But again started to hang. Requested for replacement, but not getting replacement during warranty. I purchased this because of its high rating and it looks amazon rating is fake.

"
"

  I ordered this phone on behalf of a relative and she confirmed tht the battery last only 2-3 hours.When she went to MI service centre, they said tht they cannot replace the phone because it is bought on Amazon and Amazon should replace it. Some nonsense.They have finally agreed to replace the battery.please be careful buying Mi Phones.

"
"

  I bought it on 13 jul 20 and from last 10 days I am having a huge problem like battery is getting down very fast, phone is getting hanged again and again. When sometime someone is calling me my phone screen is getting totally black. Messages are sometimes been shown in dragbox but when I am touching it or finding it in inbox it is invisible. I am totally hopeless that what I have bought. Total waste of money.

"
"

  A good dual camera phone in this price range. Battery is 5,000 mah, but performs like 4,000 mah. Camera is good. The best thing is its screen. A nice 6.2"" inch display. Similar to most high value mobiles from this same brand. This sky white colour is best among three. A perfect budget phone till date.

"
"

  Posting reviews after using it for 1 month:Cheap quality intarnal materials used ex. Camera sensor, bluetooth, etc.Realized after experiencing following unexpected problems:- screen hanging- bluetooth not connecting now, earlier connecting when it was- leaves the marks/shadow of the icons/screen elements used in previous applications or even after accessing the contacts or any content.- mobile charger gets heated up like anything after 5-10 min of chargingQuality getting cheaper as the number of users increasing. Company only eye on maximizing the profits. That's what the conclusion is.

"
"

  Exactly once 10 days over for replacement 11 th day phone display goes off. Went to service centre asked for replacement they said nit possible done change of display of some other model and given much dissatisfied from this purchase.

"
"

  I think mobile delivered to me today is defective and not in working condition.So it is surprised like a reputed E_Com , Amazon India doing this type of delivery.it hampers your name and fame.please file a case or written compaint to your seller.

  Redmi 8A Dual 3gb 32gb..Mobile average performance..Not available Fingerprint Reader..Battery life performance also average 5000Mah Battery not going full 2 day with normal usage..Camera quality is also average not upto mark..No slow motion video.. not more option..And main thing so many adds on apps unnecessary  getting notifications...Totaly average performance..But good thing is this mobile getting USB TYPE C & Fast Charging Support is available...

"
"

  I had this Smartphone for my mother. Now after using it about 15 days , I can assure you that Xiaomi has arranged a great deal , but by the time passes new Smartphones will be it's competitors. So remember it's time and current scenario I can completely recommend you to buy this phone if your budget is below 10k .I had ordered 3gb+32gb sea blue variant and got delivered within 5 days , thanks to Amazon. The phone supports 18 watt fast charging and has 5000 mah battery and face unlock , which are unexpected in this price range. But Snapdragon 439 processor is not eligible to do any hard work . I would recommend to use this phone for basics.

  Important tip: Buy 3GB version to run free fire and other apps without any lags (Available Ram 2 GB/3GB).●Mobile is very good without any lags till now. (using Messenger, Whatsapp, gaana app simultaneously).●Don't buy this mobile for playing high config games. Processsor and graphics hardware are of average quality.●The battery is huge in this mobile. Charging with realme 20W charger took around 2 hours (10% to 95%).●The front and back camera is good in this price segment, and don't expect a quality like 15k mobiles.●The screen comes with a corning gorila 5, with no extra thin screen protector which other phones has.●Face unlock is good but sometimes doesn't work in low light. That is completely ok in 8k mobile.●Now the main thing which I don't like on this phone is useless apps which can't be uninstall. (like MiPay, MI secure vault, etc MI apps). And we can't trust these apps as government banned many MI apps because Xiomi read  and store every activity you do with those apps. So only use google apps to secure data and personal details. BTW it is still not reliable because MI11 OS also can read all your data. Some MI apps has own T&Cs which no one reads before opening. So use Xiomi phones carefully and don't store any banks information or passwords.

  It's not called grey colour... If there is no stock of the required colour,it should be shown to the customer... Should not just give any colour you have.That's the problem,but this colour too is not bad.

  I have upgraded from 7a to 8a, this series was released just three months after the earlier version.The battery🔋 which is 5000mah doesn't seem to be showing lot of difference from the 4000mah on the previous 7a. The only negative being the weight of the phone is a little heavier than the previous one. The blue color looks great but the phone is not easy to hold, you have to add back cover with a grip.Camera is good but the front camera has a lot of AI in it. When I took a picture with the back and front camera, the front looked too bright with a lot of brightness.Call quality is very good and it sounds almost like Nokia quality. Videos look good.  I have dropped my old phone a few times with absolutely no damage to body or phone function. I don't use the face lock so can't comment

"
"

  The phone does not boot up. I am not sure what quality check has gone into the product. unfortunately I was not able to return the product on time and the return window got lapsed. Now I am running at the MI brand store to get the product replaced. I spoke with amazon customer care and the seller and they were not willing to replace the product as it got out of the window. What good is a phone if it does not even boot up, What quality testing was done on the phone. Worst exp with amazon and with the seller. I was asking them for replacement as I could not ope n the product on time due to medical issues.

Network seems okay so far!I still wonder why don't we get an EDGE to EDGE DISPLAY  & why REDMI LOGO had to be down there. Besides why did they had to come out with shady hue (Sky White, Midnight Grey & Sea Blue) versions, & why not just simple sleek 'Black or White' . They could have been more simple though, i don't seem if the design at the rear does any wonders or is  wow factor..Thanks to Amazon!

  The phone is good for the average user. I can say the one who needs streaming apps, whatsApp, Facebook and similar other app will love the phone. Everything is as per expectation. Would have surely liked the product if it was made in India. The model I received is Made in China. Battey backup is good. I am not into much of camera but it comes with 13MP which is good from business point of view.Face recognition is working 7/10 times. No fingerprint scensor. But it's okay for few people like us. Storage is more than enough with 53GB. And 3 GB RAM works well with all apps I mentioned.

"
"

  Defective product. Started auto shutoff and on after just completion of return date. I have purchased it on 12th July 2020. Problem started from 25th July and surprisingly 24th July was last date to return. Very much disappointed. I am purchasing so many products from Amazon. They should check thoroughly before delivering at the cost of their reputation.

"
"

  This is the third Xiaomi product I'm purchasing but this time I'm highly disappointed. 8A phone is no different than Redmi 7A except that this is quite bulky to hold and has better battery life and comes with a C-type charger. Redmi 7A is a lot better than 8A in terms of design. Don't go for the Blue coloured one of 8A, cos it has a funny shade than what's seen in the pictures. Camera claims to have 13mp lens but has no quality of even an 8mp Samsung phone. Also has poor settings with so much beautifying filter which makes everything look so lighter in shade, polished and cartoon like. Xiaomi used to deliver top notch quality phones and camera at the same price range when they launched phones during 2015-16 time period. Xiaomi is compromising a lot on camera quality. The touch response of the handset i received is slow. Also they're refusing to return the product and instead they're giving me a replacement of the same phone which I don't want. When we contacted the Amazon customer care they're asking us to place the return after accepting the second replacement. Why this complication when you can return the first right away than make everyone take double risk of travel in this time of pandemic.

  I take online classes so video and voice must be clear. The mobile should be slim and light weight to put on tripod.  I needed a rough and tough high performance phone within my budget constraints.C type charging pin means long pin life. Battery backup is superb, Speaker sound is quite loud, slim body and vibrant colours look smart. Camera is more than enough to fulfill my need as an amateur photographer.Display and handling is quite good. Normal apps work smoothly and I don't use phone for gaming. WhatsApp, Facebook, youtube, etc work well and 64GB Storage with 3GB RAM is more than enough for me.

"
"

  Pros:1.Great Battery Backup.2. The display quality is good.3. The processor is powerful enough for daily tasks not for gaming.4. The only phone with Type-C charging port under 10k, supports fast charging.Cons:1. No fingerprint reader.2. Pre-installed Bloatware.3. Normal charger instead of a fast charger.4. Average camera: Good in daylight(Use Gcam for best results).Overall a decent phone for a college student, Family members.

"

  It's a great phone in low budget. If you are looking a low budget phone then you will go for it. It will provide you fully satisfaction.ProsBattery life is awesome.Build quality is good.Display is also very good in this price range.ConsIt does not have finger lock sencer.Face lock is slow but ok in this price range.Back cover in unavilable in the box.If you find my review helpful then like it guys

  Its average phone and disappointed with Amazon as they havent mentioned country of origin as China

  Writing this review after using this device for 2 months.Delivery was super fast (Delivered in just 2 days)..Pros :-1. Big Display (This 6'22"" display is really good for day to day usage).2. Battery & Charging - 5000 mAH battery lasts upto 2 to 2½ days for a normal usage and this supports 18w fast charger and also have USB Type-C cable which is excellent in this price range.3. Look & Feel - This entry level smartphone have a polycarbonate back which is decent and have a good grip..., And it also have Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protection in the front.4. Face Unlock feature - This smartphone doesn't have fingerprint sensor but have a face Unlock which is quite reliable and works well..Cons :-1. Processor - They should have gone for Snapdragon 450 or 460, SD439 is old processor.2.  Bloatwares - There are adds in this device & also have few bloatwares like Mi Community & Helo App which are banned by Indian Government..Overall this is a good upgrade from Redmi 7A at this price range..If you want an entry level smartphone this one is good.

"
"

  This is a great product under the 10k range..personally loved it.Though it doesn't have finger print sensor its beautifully designed and can be used.. i've bought this for my father n he loves it.. battery life is 5000mah which is huge and camera quality is good for this range. . so you can definitely give a try

"
"

  The phone is beautifully designed, including the patterned plastic back and the dewdrop notch design. the battery life is good but it could be better but since it's miui,there isn't much you can get apart from ads in the UI which are hard to turn off,there's a lot of invasive bloatware and adware,also the camera quality is average,there was no need for a dual cam setup(I feel the lower camera can be fake),the front cam is average too,I think should've gone with the 9i. Also, there's no screen protector or cover in box

"
"

   Bought  a new redmi dual 8A through Amazon .There is a technical issue with this handset.its functioning on it's own .various screen and key pad functions start functioning without even touching the handset.Amazon is not willing  to replace the handset. What a waste of money

"
"

  I have got a defective product today I pluged earphone but it didn't work than I thought the ear phone is faulty I tried new one but this didn't work too. Then I tried both earphone on another phone these were working.And returning period is also over but the good thing is I rarely use earphone but when I tried earphone today first time and found the product is faulty I have got a lot of anger but it was my mistake too that I didn't check it in starting days.Ya, but it worthy to be criticized.Instead of this sometimes it's touch do not respond instantly, I have got this problem later.

"
"

  Everything is good in mobile but processor is little bit slow(if u r a game user not recommended). Also if u use many applications simultaneously then mobile will go slow.Some how I disappointed that chinese applications is still in there by default and you can't uninstall them,such as mi browser,mi music, mi pay, cleanmaster, mi video, xiaomi wheather etc. Chinese applications is banned in india and company xiaomi india also remove all these Chinese applications.Overall recommended if u r not a heavy user battery backup is good and type-c charger  which support 18watt fast charging is the only pros of this mobile.

"
"

  Fingerprint sensor is not available, face unlock feature is available, value for money phone for this price range , I exchanged with my old HTC device ,it costs me around 6299 Rs for 2GB variant , built quality is good, feels solid in hand , sky white colour looks pretty decent and beautiful in hand, cannot expect a good gaming  performance from this device, tried playing Pubg lite & Free fire, not suitable for gamming. Best part is battery back up & USB Type C charging port with fast charging options available. Not satisfied with the face unlock feature. Can be considered as a good option for secondary handset, overall a value for money product.

"
"

  Product is working slowly. Keyboard not working properly. Was trying to return the product, showing is not eligible. Product was delivered on 4th March. Within a month all these issues are coming up. Feeling really bad.

"
"

  I have read the reviews before buying the mobile. So thought to give it a luck. After using for 1 day the mobile screen keep on touching itself from any part of the screen. The phone hangs a lot. Pubg runs good at times but a lot of time it lags. I checked the battery performance in setting, the screen itself consuming more than 94% of battery which makes battery drain rapidly. I have replaced it. Now got a replacement with tampered mobile box. However the packing was not tempered. To my surprise it is a used mobile. Fingerprint of former user was found on mobile screen and charger. The mi seal was broken and re-pasted and delivered to me. The seller think himself oversmart. Keep distributing used mobile to the customers. I have checked this mobile condition which is good at outside but the internet connectivity is very poor it does not go beyond 350kb at 2am midnight Jio 4G. Which goes beyond 2Mbps at this time in other mobile phone. Also charger is heated up when charging within 20 minutes and it's not 18W power charger. So i got a defective used product in replacement.  Now i  want my refund. I am not satisfied with this mobile. The conclusion is that if you are lucky enough than this mobile will work for a few day until replacement period is over or maximum 15 days later you will repent at your choice. Better put 1-2k more and get better mobile than this Redmi 8A Dual 3-32.

  The Budget BeastNo words to describe the new Redmi 8A especially its stunning look ... amazing display with water drop notch looks premium. This design is seen only in 15 k segment from Samsung where Xiaomi did it.Awesome cameraI have used 4A & 7A but comes to 8A its totally changed in camera. Its AI powered camera gives excellent output even in low light conditions  worth it...oooohIncredible Battery but not hulky5000 mAh class leading battery gives approximate two days of normal use without charging twice. Not much bulky in hand and weight is optimized!!!!! wowperformance is out of the worldGames, movies, chatting, shooting no compromise on multitasking Smoothly run by octa core chipset from Snapdragon 439 is excellent at this price point is amazing....octa core at 6K OMG....main disadvantage I have noticed is there is no notification led...

  Battery is okCamera is goodBut missing warranty cardWhy cheated like this fruaders

"
"

  Ok phone. Brought as I got good exchange price of my old phone against purchase of redmi 8a dual. Speed ok. Phone hangs sometimes. Camera ok. Call quality and battery life superb. Display very good for budget phone. One defect. IR blaster is not working on my redmi 8a dual since day one. One irritating this that MI asks permission to store data and track for almost everything we use on this phone. Would rate it ok purchase as I got for only 3000 in exchange of my old phone.

"
"

  Simple smartphone, but Good Smartphone! Camera average but included PRO mode, Battery backup excellent Charged 4 days ago. Used normal internet and Dual 4G native video calling and WiFi Hotspot without gaming till now. Display 6'22"" good, No lag, Good face detection. Overall 9/10 but if you consider the price then it's 10/10 actually.

"
"

  Battery life is good but as it is not fast charging, it takes 3-4 hours to charge completely. It looks really good as well...and so far it's performance has been amazing. Camera is good as well. Overall it's an excellent phone in this price range.But do refer to it's YouTube review as well. All of its features and deficiencies are explained in detail there.

"
"

  In products detailed information it is mentioned, product would be made in India, but why delivered product is made in China. I know company is from China, however I thought product is getting manufactured in India. Please put correct information in product details.

"
"

  - utmost thing is battery backup- camera is too good at good light condition- low light camera is blurry- speakers are good at sound- there is double tap for screen wake- the VoWifi(Voice over WiFi) is available for selected operators- network reception is also good- phone is little bit heavy- it will good if here is LED notificationat last i would say the phone is best value phone from Xiaomi But there UI bugs are ridiculous

"
"

  Good mobile for the price you get. SD439 does the day to day job, definitely gaming is not amongst those. Camera is what you get for the price. The highlight is battery which is absolutely killer. Can easily give a screen on time of 10 plus hrs on mixed usage. Supports fast charging however only 10 watts charger is supplied in the box and,without any headphones which is understandable at this price.

"
"

  Good budget mobile for basic usage like attending online classes, listening to music, watching videos and normal browsing. The limited 2 GB RAM doesn't allow for multitasking and gaming which you obviously can't expect in a phone at this price. The features are really amazing like the p2i coating, Gorilla Glass 5 and wireless FM which makes this a strong and durable phone to have!

"
"

  Did lot of research before buying.At this budget this the best phone I found it in market. I am not big fan of redmi. But it is cost effective and good for short term use.Over all phone is okay don’t expect much .Sound quality is good.Battery life is also good.Have all the required basic features.Camera is not that great if you need good camera dont go for it.Phone is heating while charging.Go for it if it fit in your budget.Overall okay.

"
"

  Redmi 8a dual is the worst mobile in the market. The phone has serious lag issues and the home page freezes from time to time. I got a replacement after I complained about lag issues and the second piece turned out to be worst than the first. Now I am stuck with this ""brick"" of a mobile forever. After a complaint about the replacement, Amazon sent a service expert who was unaware of my phone's problem. He came, he saw, he yelled, he blabbered and left telling that the phone is fine according to him and that I have 365 days time to keep visiting the Mi service centre day after day.

"
"

  Hello guys,I am using this phone from 8th july. When i Bought it and start using it initially there was issues of automatic brightness of the display, it was getting stuck at particular level and in the bright light you need to manually increase the brightness. but after software update all those issues were resolve but now i am facing phone slow down issue very much. After this much time phone is got slower and slower. if you go to camera it just hung.very very bad ...experience .... earlier i was using note 4 of mi. which is still working very well ...And one should expect better performance from latest gadget .... which is totally missing....I shall not recommend to buy this product....Do not feel bad Mi.......  Please work on it..Thank you.

"
"

  It’s just not worth the money. I have used MI phones earlier and they work fine but this one is useless.1) it’s very slow and if you open multiple app at a time the phone will hang2) Even opening YouTube application on this phone takes close to 8-10 seconds3) Battery is very and will last appx 1 day with normal usage4) lot of ads pop up which is irritating5) Camera is very bad , My earlier MI 5A takes better pictures than this phoneOverall very unhappy with this product.I have been using this since 10 days now.

"
"

  I returned this the third day after delivery.It hanged in my very first use LOL !•Camera is below average.•Processes is average.•It does not have fingerprint reader.•• Hangs when you record video using Snapchat & WhatsApp. (third party apps)Honestly, Even in Rs.8999, you can get much much much much better experience!AND I'M NOT EXAGGERATING.

"
"

  There is one feature of this phone wherein we can tab three times on screen to see zoom view; when I enabled that, I found lagging issue with phone and also screen got freeze some times, with this option face diffuculty to dial a phone when we need to type like 9998 it's my own number series,Camera performance disappoint me; in day lite it's Ok, I can say average, and in night compete zero..""0"", and color capturing is also not good.I am happy with design, that gives rich look, touch is smooth, also allows to delete preinstalled games & other application.It's okay with this price and No cost EMI option.Thank you

"
"

  The phone got slow after one week use, i wanted to replace but the replace window is closed. Camera & battery are average, It's not like 13MP & 5000Mah. The device is not suitable to play any game even ludo, it's started lagging when you open ludo and after shut any from your app your home display become blank for few seconds ...........Worst experience.Dear Amazon team, please help to replace the device.

"
"

  Rear camera quality is below average, main problem is with auto focus, camera is struggling to focus on objects.Wireless display feature problem, wireless display is frequently disconnected with Smart TV.OS become unstable sometimes, need to reboot is the only option to recover the phone.Failed to upgarde on MIUI 11, after complete download of around 2 GB, it fails to update on MIUI 11.

"
"

  निश्चित रूप से रेडमी ने अपने आप को काम कीमत में बेहतर फीचर्स एवम् क्वालिटी मोबाइल कंपनी के रूप में स्थापित किया है परन्तु कॉम्पटीशन के चक्कर में रेड़मी ने सस्ते पार्ट्स इस्तेमाल करना शुरू कर दिया है। यही वजह है कि रेडमी के फोन्स की क्वालिटी घटती जा रही है। Redmi 8a में mike की घटिया क्वालिटी इसका एक नमूना है। मै redmi 8a के 5 से भी ज्यादा फोन में वही same mike problem देख चुका हूं। Vioce क्लियर नहीं आती । Feels like old days chinese mobile phone।प्लीज खरीदने से पहले एक बार किसी भी दूसरे के मोबाइल को इस्तेमाल करके देख लें । Totally disappointed this time

  Bought the phone for my wife when her phone screen was damaged. It was on offer on Amazon at the time and for its price, it seemed like a great deal. Note that the spec says 2GB ram, 32GB storage. Being a Samsung user, i wasn't sure how the experience would be. However i am happy to report that aside from a few hitches, this phone is excellent. The 2GB may seem less but i never noticed any issue when using fb or youtube. I cannot recommend it for intensive gaming but for casual use like watching videos etc, it is fine. I havent tested the selfie cam yet but the front cam is pretty good. There is no fingerprint sensor. Even though the phone supports fast charging, there is no fast charger provided. No earphones. Basically just the phone and regular charger. Ensure you remove the preinstalled bloatware and banned chinese software. Finally an excellent 5000 mAh battery that lasts almost a whole day on active use. All in all, a phone perfect for the casual user.

"
"

  Ordered it for my mother. Good phone for her but for average user it is not that good.Cons:Phone keep hanging if multitasking done like opening of 2 or more apps at same time.Battery life is also not so good.Built Quality and finishing is not good.Pros:SnapDragon processor at this range.Handy phone.

"
"

  Nice phone, as expected. Only negative side is that it belongs to a Chinese company and a part of our payment will reach the Chinese (though made in India).Only Sub 10K price range phone with snapdragon processor and 64GB phone memory.Phone don't have fingerprint unlock, but have face unlock.Battery lasts for 2 days for average normal use (calls, social media and youtube, without gaming)Camera also good, with decent portrait mode with background blur and all the gimmicks.All in all a good budeget phone.Still i am a little upset that i supported the Chinese (even though indirectly)

"
"

  First I ordered this mobile on 6th July and got it on 9th july(2020). There was 3.5 mm jack issue with this mobile and I ordered for it's return.Again I got a new mobile on 13th July but I can return my mobile till 20th July.On 22nd July I faced another issues with this new mobile. Apps opening and closing itself. Nither I can close my app nor I can switch off mobile. For example if I'm surfing fb then it suddenly get closed and suddenly open. Even mobile automatically start typing in comment box.So I just want to tell you pls don't go for this mobile.

  I purchased this product only cause my one plus was broke and I couldn’t get it repaired on time. I needed a spare phone for emergencies and I bought this product considering the cost factor. I’ve never used any of RedMi products and since RedMi claim that they are the products for cost I wanted to give it a try. As I expected, it’s the worst performance phone. I’m not talking about the performance equal to a premium smartphone. I’m talking about basic use. The touch is worse. It taps automatically and makes the usage of phone a nightmare. Have to restart it multiple times to fix that issue temporarily. U never know when the same error occurs. Other than that, major thing is “THE DEVICE TURNS OFF ALL OF SUDDEN FROM NOWHERE AND WONT TURN ON AT ANY COST”. Nobody knows why that happened and will have to factory reset the device from device factory mode. Will never buy any of the RedMi products just because of price. I’d rather get a good quality product even if I have to pay a little more money.I’d not recommend at all be it any product coming from this company.

  Lots of useless manufacturer and google apps. You open the box and it feels like you're using someone else's phone. Additionally, they cant be uninstalled. Hogs up 14 GB of 32 GB space and you're left with only 18 GBs. And if you're using two sims you cant even insert a memory card to store pics/music or whatever.Ads everywhere! You open any of their apps, even the system apps, and adds are there to greet you.Does not come with a fingerprint senser.Battery life is decent but lets see how it works 6 months from now.Has an ugly(imo) screen tint as default. And for some reason, every time I restart I have to set the tint and turn off auto-brightness all over again.  Idk if it's a fault or I am not doing it right.Screen guard and back cover not included in the box as is the norm with some other manufacturers.Comparing it with Honor 8c which I bought last year for roughly the same price (8.3k), this phone's resolution is massively inferior to Honor's even though they both claim it to be 720 x 1520 pixels.Very disappointed and underwhelmed with this purchase. Only keeping it because it was the cheapest phone (among newer releases) in the 32gb/3gb category on amazon. You save your money to buy an entry level phone and still it doesn't feel personalised. Fed up with these proprietary devices. Linux mobile distros cant come soon enough.

  Worst phone I have ever purchased...3 gb ram but lags a lot on full version kine master and other designing apps other. I have tried the trial on two mi 8 phones pic attached of both.. Samsung and Huawei phones with 3 gb are best it was my first mi phone and I m disappointed with this phone. I was using huawei and Samsung 3 gb ram varient and are best till date after more than 2 years of rugged usage. Even micromax 4311 3gb ram is faster than miI suggest to go for Samsung. mi is best for those who have not used Samsung and huawei(including honor) ram and battery management is best in Samsung, micromax and huawei

  Redmi 8a dual is a balanced phone in its price rangeAdvantages...1. Processor is SD2. Display3.build quality4. battery life5. Face unlock6. Type c charging fast chargingDisadvantages...1. Front and rear camera quality is not up to the mark. It is slightly below avg quality. I hope redmi can fix it by software update.2. Picture stabilization is not up to the mark.3. Sound quality should be given slightly better.4. I have big issue with interface miui. There are a lot of adds.5. Some deadly apps come with pre installed. Those garbages should be removed by software update.Overall if you are looking for a low budget phone for your parents usage purpose or child's study purpose, this is the right one battery is larger, processor is good for day to day life usage and display is much better. Face unlock is fast. But redmi should Remove the garbage apps. Overall 4.5 star for the phone below 8k.

   I dislike the phone because fingerprint reader so poor that after few times it start becomes blur and screen got shake automatically and poor camera quality. My money goes in vain totally rubbish product. Do not buy any chinese because two of my chinese phone working very worst. I am not lying please see the image and video I have uploaded.

"

  It's a little hard to use with one hand, and the keyboard doesn't seem to have one-handed mode, but the split screen feature and the screen brightness make up for that. This is the first smartphone I've used where the minimum brightness is satisfactory for use in a dark room. The dark mode and reading mode options are quite helpful, too. The screen is also resistant to damage, to a certain extent. The battery cannot be removed, but there seems to be a fair amount of ingress protection because of that. Lastly, it comes with its own USB-C charging cable, which is a little short but charges well enough.

  I have ordered this product on September 1 and got it on sep 3. After 3 days ,the display stops it's working. The image in these display are now show as multiple images and are floating most of the time. Not even able to read atleast a word properly.Some times it seems normal but most of the time they are not working. I have brought this for my siblings for attending online classes. But this product is absolutely useless. My all other phones are brought from Flipkart and other sites. But none of them are of this kind. All of them are working properly. I thought that the product from Amazon might be having better quality than other sites,but now I think that I was wrong. I lost believe in Amazon. I have contacted the customer service and they told that service exicutive will inspect the phone and then only they can proceed. But I think this is not fair because the executive will reach to my house after two days and after inspection they will decide what to do. I need refund for this item, I will brought product of another company from somewhere else. Or I will file a case in consumer court for this issue against MI and Amazon India for cheating me. I have discussed this with an advocate.

  It is a basic phone ... If you have money add 2k or 4k and opt for another model.( Phone supports manily  for children and elder parent )Redmi note 8 or pocco m2* Positives *Best at 7.5k* Excellet battery* Good display* Use for online class* Negative ** No finger print ( but at this price range exceptional )* Camera is biggest issue.. I have expected more from rear cam..* Little bit of hang at 2gb ram , go for 3 gb ram ...* Cannot use for hard, not a gaming phone..

  I bought this product with exchange, exchanged with old redmi 5. The pick up guy verified the mobile in and out and picked up from home. Surprisingly after one day he called and said glass is broken which we never noticed. And am sure it was not. We cant say what he did in 1 day with mobile. Now asking to return. It is not acceptable, i do not know wht all he did with mobile. If it was broken he could have rejected during pick up. This what i do not like..

"
"

  Phone is a good option in this range.It lacks fingerprint scanner. Camera quality is not so good. It is a very heavy phone,  difficult to keep itnin hands id you are using it for long while lying in bed. But it is worth buying.It has made in india sticker also,  not sure if it is real.

"
"

  At first glance I was happiest person to have bought this phone at Rs 7499  (2GB Ram, 32 GB internal memory). The joy was, however, short lived. The charger failed to work. Went for return option but customer executive suggested a test via Blancco App. Done. Thereafter, he assigned a technician to visit my place and inspect the phone. Alas, the technician didn't turn up nor did he respond to call. In the meantime, phone frequently began to hang and misbehave. As of now I am cursing my fate. It is worst ever phone i have come across. Don't waste your money. You will repent the decision to buy this phone. Please take my advice seriously. This Redmi 8A dual phone will turn your face red with anger...

  I have  purchased this mobile on 25 July and within seven days mobile Battery is draining very fast. I want to return this faulty mobile. But return window is closed .Amazon can help in this

"
"

  I've been using Xiaomis product from Its Note 4 launch and was satisfied by its performance as well as its manufacturing in India as all the box contains information that it is MADE IN INDIA but this was the 1st time i bought this phone and it doesnt have that MADE IN INDIA logo and it's clearly written over there on the phone that it's MADE IN CHINA😠 I've not expected this from #Redmi_India that they cannot afford a budget segment phones manufacturing in their own country 🤧🤕

"
"

  It has a problem. Of getting auto boot since day one.....recently it flashed with Android 10.....and since then it shuts down auto and it takes very firm press on the power button to boot.....and when u are doing this after every 2 hrs then quite a fun.....I will never buy MI product in my life......it was first n last time I did.....these cheap Chinese re-incarnation claiming to be made in India. .....I really don't believe with the quality it's packed with.....

"
"

  At the budget I didn't have any other choice. So bought this phone, totally a killer.Cons - signal reception not good and no fingerprint scanner.Pros - display and battery is awesome.I had issues with battery backup atfirst later on I turned off may things, which was automatically running in background. Now the battery is unbelievably good, mom is totally Happy with it.

"
"

  At this price range this is a good buy. The phone looks elegant and sleek.The camera is good outdoors in sunlight but in dark spaces it does not perform well. Again at this price it is worth it.The Ad ridden OS is a bit irritating but once the warranty is void one can install custom ROM.It is easy to handle and carry and the does not feel heavy even with the 5k battery.Did not face any overheating issues so far.I never play games so have nothing to comment on that front.Screen clarity is good and brightness in sunlight is also not an issue (I use dark mode)Overall a good buy but in a month or so you may get better models.

  I've used many phones in this budget segment from renowned brands. I was always skeptical about Redmi/Xiaomi. It was hard to make a decision of buying this phone. But to be honest, I'm totally moved! Be it the display, be it looks, usage, it is totally a power package. The amazing thing is, you're getting 5000 MAH battery in less than 8k ! Easily runs over 1.5 days with a full charge and average usage (multitasking, video streaming, browsing, social media). It also comes with 18W Fast Charging support. The display will blow your mind. Looks are quite good, could've been better. What is a drawback is it doesn't have a Fingerprint Sensor, which is a must for phones in this budget! Camera quality is ""just okay"".Lastly, I'm using this device for the last 4-5 days, didn't feel any lag though it comes with 2GB RAM, all credits to Redmi's amazing optimisation.You can go for it without a single doubt in your mind if your budget is right.

"

  Very bad experience, just after 20 days, it is not working properly. Many times while using this ohone, it automatically closes all the apps and returns to home screen and then it just hangs and then we have to restart it to make it work again.

"
"

  I am using 2gb/32gb variant(white). Using it since 16 days and have not found a problem yet... No hanging/lagging...i have downloaded games of 250-300 mb and played it... The result was fantastic and neither it hanged nor became hot while playing or charging... Speaker sound is pretty good and Camera quality is superb in good lighting conditions mainly during day time (outdoors), no one can say it's a 8k below phone by looking it's camera performance due to SD processor and battery backup is good too....Conclusion:- This phone is for people who are not game addict and those who love photography but are know in budget... The phone performance is lag free for day to day usage and most importantly uninstall or disable the preloaded apps if you don't use it.

  The modem of this phone is very slow. It gives only half the actual speed. My other phone gives a speed of 90mbps on wifi whereas this phone give only 40 mbps on same network. Getting less than 1 mbps on LTE networks. Camera is below average.

"
"

  Don't go for this phone unless your budget is very low.This phone doesn't have aby fingerprint scanner. Fast charger doesn't come in the box.Neither comes a back case or screen protector or headphone. You have to buy all those separately.Camera quality is also not good.My suggestion is to spend 1-2k extra and go for other good phones.

"
"

  I would like to start with prosPros:1. After unboxing, the first feel and look is awesome. The aura x grip design on the back of the device is superb considering its price range which gives a premium feel while you are holding the device in your hands.2. The big 6.22 inch ips lcd display of resolution 720x1520. The viewing angles are good and comes with support of sunlight display which mean in outdoors one will not have a problem viewing this device. Due to its large screen content consuming is very good and the dot notch in the top middle of the screen does not annoy while watching videos or playing games. The display also comes with gorilla glass 5 protection which is very rare in this price segment and protects your device to some extent from scratches and drops.3. This device comes with p2i nano coating which means it can save the device from splashes of water to a certain extent. But do not dip it in water as it is not water resistant.4. This device comes with snapdragon 439 processor which is based on 12nm process. This chipset can go up to 2ghz and performs day to day task and gaming easily. Pubg lite and pubg mobile runs smoothly on this device. Pubg lite can go up to a maximum resolution of balanced at very high frame rates whereas pung mobile can go upto balanced with medium frame rates. Both games run smoothly without any lag or stutter.5. This device is powered by a 5000mah battery which gives a backup of upto 2 dys on average usage. But for heavy gamers and content viewers this device gives backup of upto a day on single charge. This device comes with 10ww charge and if you charge with 10w charger it takes around 2hr 30min but if you charge it by 18w charger it takes around 2hr.6. The camera on the back is 13+2 mp AI dual camera. The ai scene detection is good and fast. The backgroung blur during portrait mode is very good and the selfie camera is 8mp ai camera. This also support portrait mode but the blur could have been better. Both camera support 1080p recording at 30fps.7. Comes with face unlock and is pretty fast with proper lighting condition.Cons:1. The cameras could have been better.2. IR blaster is missing.3. Notification Led is missing.4. Fingerprint reader is missing.5. Both cameras struggles in low light conditions.6. Comes with miui with full of bloatwares and ads. But they can be disabled and and stopped.WARNING: For non chinese smartphone users if you buy this phone it will com with pre installed chinese apps banned by Indian government bu they will fix it with an ota update so not worry.My Opinion:After using this device I would recommend this device to buyers with budget under 10,000. Everything is good and the updates are also quick and timely. And no problem with the device.

"
"

  After 1 week of usage:Nice battery backup (5000 mah)Nice display qualityGood soundNice camera quality in this budget.Big displayFace lock available however no fingerprint scanner.As said on the box it support wireless FM but it doesn't support wireless FM you need to connect your headphone for FM frequency.Support Fast charging which is very useful thing.Overall nice phone to buy.Thanks to Amazon for the exchange offer.

  Got my new redmi phone. Overall the phone is as per the features, but the quality of camera is not as per the advertisment, selfie camera is better than back camera, you can understand how the back camera is,  previously had Samsung phone with same mega pixel camera, it clicked so well, so here is the sincere request to all buyers, if looking for good camera, don't go for it,

"
"

  this is a good smartphone which comes with the USB Type C, 5000mah Battery, Good Vivid Screen, Gorilla Glass 5 Protection ,Good Camera Dual rear Camera (13mp+2mp), 8mnp selfie camera which u don't find under other smartphones of  this Budget segment  to be noted do not compare with other high budget smartphones camera ABOVE 10Kand in the last latest android 10 update Released in india & latest MIUI 12 is on its way in next month2GB variant performs well  Ram remains all the time under 60% usageThis is Good Buck Performs and Give features u cannot find in other smartphones , and other smartphones which are available i'm sure they are under preform as per the new smartphones of Redmi 9A, Redmi 9 they even also not has these features and comes with the DOWNGRADED REBRANDED PROCESSOR

"
"

  From a budget mobile battery backup and call quality are expected, call quality is pathetic, mic not clear, other party most of the times say that my audio is not clear. Further, earpiece volume is not loud and clear, I am not a power user, just some calls where it frustrated me and some youtube that's it, battery backup is good but what is the use of advancement in technology when it is not performing it's basic task, MI if listening provide good mic, speakers and earpiece for an overall good experience,

"
"

  I expected a little more performance from a redmi phone. It has the typical problems of a 2 GB RAM phone. Really slow. I bought it for my mother. For her use it is just ok. For better performance, a minimum 4 GB RAM phone is needed, no matter which brand you select.

"
"

  I bought this phone for my Father and generally preferred type c charging port which is provided by this 8000 rupee phone , although it has old processor but i must say optimization is good and also look of this is just awesome (not feel like cheap phone).Only draw back is miui which tons of ad but i find a solution to remove unnecessary apps which send anonymous notification.

"
"

  It have sturdy Build Quality . corned with gorilla glass 5 and The display quality is Good.Pros :-Nice Build Quality 10/10Good Camera (both front and back)8/10Smooth performance 9/10Face unlock is pretty fast ( never expected that ) 10/10Good for Mid end gaming 8/10Battery is an absolute monster 10/10Nice display 8/10USB C + fast chasrging 10/10Cons  :-No Finger print censorMy Rating is 8.5/10

"
"

  I don't like this.This is not a good product, I'm huge fan of redmi mobiles,i had also used the phone of this company and that was awesome but this is not good.I will just give only one 🌟 because the phone is not working properly and it is hanging

"
"

  When it comes to budget mobile phones with latest features u cant go wrong with Xiaomi phones. This model is  one such example. You get Good battery, Gorilla screen, big screen size (very big so some 1) etc. Overall value for money!

"
"

  I use this phone more than 5 months I buy it on 4 march 2020 this phone is very very nice 😊👍 in my favor because I buy this phone for my father and it is very easy to use for him and but i brought this phone at range of 6999 rupee and also I see that phone is not lagging and not get heated 🔥  and camera of phone is also niceBut 1 mistake is that his AI screen lock 🔐 not ❌ get open in Instantely but overall this phone cames with 24 hour battery life if you check this phone in volt 📞 and sync and volt to use without power savingBut i see this phone price is geeted increase from 6999++ that shocking for this phone love for people and for peoplepeople and i also play PUBG in a starting months to check the phone performance which is ossom his all sensor almost Avery was working but i don't play now because it my father's mobile 🤣🤣🤣🤣💯💯

"

  Best mobile in this budget, Great battery backup...Just once when mobile received, Pls Go in to settings - Accessibility - OFF will be done.Not any problem shown till now, I purchased this mobile 3 Qty for me - my sister - mh wife. (By different ID's)Not a single problem shoen till now.

"
"

   Hii Everyone...I received this phone in a brand new condition.Everything was fine but there is a technical issue in the software or might be in display....When i used this phone on the very first day i did not notice this error.But next day i saw this fault.The display of the phone was getting hang sometimes...Pixels was bursting also...And there were some glitches on the display when i was using it.So i returned this phone. You may also see the pictures and video which i attached here.It might be a technical error.Otherwise Packaging was good.I received this product too early.It was not a seller's fault.Amazon also refunded the total amount.Thank you Amazon.

"
"

  There is no finger print point,. Camera quality is very cheap & poor even 5000/- phone has better camera. If single camera is better, no need of such dual camera. XIAOMI just making fool. Screen is so so. Battery is good. Overall just 5 yrs back quality.

"
"

  All good, as per the cost, eveey this is appropriate but it could have the fingerprint scanner. Processor and ram is okay for this price... No over heating issue. Good and smooth running. Can play Cod or pubg in medium settings. Battery is okay.. 5 watt charger in the box,, but it supports 18 watt fast chaeger, at this price, in box 5 watt charger is okay but if it could come, it shall be a best option because battery is big 5000 mah. No back cover. All redmk phns come with a back cover. But this is exceptional in this phone. All over 7 out of 10. Performance is excellent but accessories could have been upgraded in the box.

"
"

  Firstly 5 stars to Amazon for delivery this mobile phone with in 24 hours.Coming to this mobile phone, my first impressions are it is working good and I liked it's display.  Especially this low budget phone has Vowifi ( Wifi calling ) feature.  Camera is not good ( don't except much for this low price).  Still review under progress.

"
"

  Nice phone in this price range except bit big to handle . I personally recommend not go for this screen size, as it is very difficult to handle or pick call using one hand (mostly during driving or doing some other work). it is quite slippery, so you land up with cover which makes it too big to keep it in pocket.

"
"

  This review is for REDMI 8A DUAL 3GB RAM 32GB ROM(for use 21gb)Nice budget product. Large battery life last 1-2days. Camera is of average quality. Dual 4g standby. Charger given is of 10 watt. Type c port otg support. No fingerprint . Has face unlock. No ir blaster. Good sound and its quality. Sim tray is risky to use very delicate. Very less heating if you use it continuous

"
"

  Not really value for money, a lot of bloatware comes pre-installed even in October 2020, many ads, faltu apps like hago, Zilli, etc. Are automatically installed within 24 to 48 hours of usage. xiaomi is cheating on everyone by showing they didn't give installed app but they automatically install it from their storage later. For specs you should go for other company phone this is overpriced by ₹500.Camera Quality is not even of 5MP. And front camera just exist for name. Once you see the quality you would not use it again

"
"

  Good phone and value for money, good at memory 3GB.. good response time, speed compared to other android phone with 3GB, may be its new 😊, if you have MI TV, screen mirroring is excellent on the full HD VIEW AND SOUND QUALITY. There’s no delay in streaming at allI bought it for online classes for my kid to use “teams” and “zoom” app streaming on big screen for better view and sound qualityAnd since a month the quality of speed and battery backup is good

"
"

  Thanks Amazon for being care full about your costumer products quality and delivery........ So i am writing an 30day long review.......... Redmi 8a dual is an such an nise phone...... I order it on colour white and ran 2gb rom32gb..... But i could not found any problem with this smartphone .......... I charge this phone for an 2houres just and it's chargeing is 👌👌👌👌very fast .,......... I am an free fire lover and I can easily play free, on this device........ I couldn't see any problem on this device camera quality is also good..,. I suggest all costumer go for....

"
"

  After using 10 days I'm writing this review, camera quality is very poor, display average, phone speed is okay, battery backup is very good, but charging time takes 3 hours, for old age people this phone is good not for youngsters

"
"

  Pretty Much Bang for The Buck if you are on a budget . You know the specs go for it . Don't expect higher performance on this budget . According to the budget Mi is delivering the best value .Now if you have some sentimental ego about Made In India products then my friend go and buy a Banana and pretend you are using a smartphone .Thank You.

"
"

  Budget phone for people who are looking to buy their 1st smart phone in life. I bought it for my mother and she is happy with it. Serves the purpose of a first time smart phone user very well. Ordered grey colour.. looks nice tooFace recognition works only in best light. Not counting it as a negative since it is not a must feature. Camera quality is good ( expect what you will get at this price)

"
"

  So far not happy with this phone , although I am not using it personally now but used it for 2 months . It’s not worth buying . Inferior quality features dines not work well . Application support as well as google store content restriction observed while installing vc apps . Don’t recommend !

"
"

  It was a good phone though it hs 2 BG ram but it looks was pretty good n battery was aswme whch was 5000 not even we get in othr top models and evn the fingerprint sensor r good but if u r buying thn buy wid 3gb or with 4gb wil more bettr

"
"

  On This Price Range Redmi 8A Dual, is best.I brought Sea blue colour smart phone grippy disign 👌. Redmi 8A Dual is best for biginners.Best camera smart phone under 8k.Main camera 13mp 👌,  secondery camera 2mp depth sensor.👍Front camera : average , It's not clicks quality pictures.👎Battery 5000 mAh : normal use 2 - 3 days battery backup.👌Display : average Lcd display.👍But display disign is superb water drop notch display.face unlock is normal but medium fast but good.Best stylish smartphone under this price thanks to Xiaomi.

"
"

  Good battery, just decent processor, can play pubg mobile only with lowest graphics only, if you want a satisfyingly smooth gaming experience, but for all other uses rather than huge games, it's best buy for this money except for moto g8 lite.

"
"

  If u want to buy a phone with ₹7000 budget this is the best phone....Awesome battery life .....speakers are good ....coming to camera I give 3.5/5...not too bad or not too good ...but money worthy

"
"

   1) Product is good but unforunately I have received this product where its Power key button not working, when i have pressed power button it shows FastBoot image logo , then again i pressed power button then it has been started.2) Also its Volume down key not working only upper key working.3) I have Taken Volume Key Button Vedio for your reference.4) If Possible contact with us because I need replacement not a refund, But when sending new device kindly check on your end all features and all physical accesseries (Like Button, Battery,Charger are in good condition i.e working properly)

"
"

  Really very nice and looks for this mobile but unfortunately thee mobile is not charging up. After contacting the customer care and they did test using the blancoo diagnostic app and confirmed the same. I have asked the replacement for this mobile but they are stated as this is service not possible & refunded the amount.Now I'm looking foe the new mobiles like redmi 9 but not able to place the order while flash sale time.

"

  Great value for moneyGreat battery lifeDoesn't hang in day to day tasksType c port with support for 18 watt chargingScreen is good for its priceCamera takes good pictures in day light but in artificial light and low light the quality is trash

  Very bad product, delivered on 12th July 2020 and I'm writing this review on 1st August 2020, the phone hanged, no app is opening, after restarting also same problem, I brought it for online studies now have to give it in service centre , very bad experience with this phone, recommend not to buy it for anyone.

"
"

  Please dond buy this...one of the worst mobile.keeps disconnected to the network and internet speed was very bad..same sim is working well in other mobile..When I purchased it was 7k,,that itself i felt wated money..Now they increased to 8200,,I dont know what makes it worth..Please dont buy this...

"
"

  Phone hangs and it behaves what ever way it want example it open wats app nd  clicks on Send nd send nd send... Without human intervention I am wondering did I bought mobile or Robot which is frustrated

"
"

  Thanx to Amazon for its fast delivery, in just 2 days..I love shopping on Amazon.One of the best phones under 9K.Redmi has proved its worth..a very good one for daily usage of social media apps like YouTube, Facebook, instagram, etc.. camera & audio quality is also very good..Also games can be played, design & midnight Black colour is simply awesome..Very good as of now I'll update after 1 month.

"
"

  If you are facing problems with the phone accessories, they do not consider it as a problem. If you want to return, they won't allow to do that. They just give chance for replacement and the replaced product may come even worse than before.The Adapter gets heated like a hair-straighter within 10 mins. I asked for a technician and they provided one after 3 weeks. I had to order replacement and the replaced product came even worse. The phone itself started heating along with the defective adapter.

"
"

  It is very initial review based on 3 days usage.First review for Amazon: Excellent experience with Amazon till date. Wonderful buying and up-to-date delivery by Amazon. Thanks.Now mobile: I purchased this redme phone for my wife by looking her usage. Handset is perfect for her and working as per the expectations. Detailed review will write after 3 months.

"
"

  1) Product- Product is good, value for money and handy.2) Delivery- Best delivery experience. Many times on time delivery followed.3) Service- Better service provided by Amazon and product seller. Nice...Keep It Up...Thanks to Amazon...

   Power button not working properly hence returned. Screen guard ordered separately there is return option. Amazon team i hope will help in this case.

  Nice phone good in 6.499 is realy nice but not so fast working when open lock it will take 4 to 5 I have to swipe than is open why this happen I don't know  n other things is battery drain fast just in 5000 mh so with use 12hr net than almost 1 day only

"
"

  Product is some what ok. Because my sister needed in this price. Seller APPARIO package is very worst. I give 1 star to seller. Just packed with cover.  No care. Worst packaging.

"
"

  Superb phone at this budget and excellent value for money plus all the features built in with the latest version of technology and software, the only thing is that it is without finger print sensor, but at this budget it is acceptable. 👍👌

"
"

  Pathetic mobile phone in cheaper price. They are not only accepting return the phone but also denying to replace it. Still I'm keep on talking to their technician and they are doing their practicals on that mobile phone by requesting to install other app, switching on and off, updating software. I'm so exhausted now with the Amazon service. I had so much trust on Amazon now their representatives and technicians are forcing me not to believe in Amazon anymore.

"
"

  My Experience is...Do not buy 2 GB Variant mobile as now days most of latest mobile run on Andorid 10 which need minimum 3 GB to run all application smoothly. while i am using app its lack many time.. Sometimes its crashes.. its a worst experience when you are using New Mobile and it doesn't meet minimum Expectation..Don't Expect Good Selfie camera,  Overall mobile is Good.Its support Fast charging is quiet nice feature given in this Price price range.Pls buy Min. 3 GB Ram Variant

"

  As per add, it was 10v charger along with the box, but in box it was 5V charger...Due to this wrong charger it is taking over 3 hours to charge 100%.... Also this charge is getting drain before Eod..Absolutely unhappy..So I would suggest, pls pay extra and go for a better mobile than this low end models....

  I purchased mobile Redmi 8A Dual from Amazon, After one month mobile is auto shut many times.Whenever call is received phone goes auto switch & auto shut.Battery is also not good, discharge within 12 hours.

"
"

  Screen is LCD, not vibrant at all. Contains lot of bloat ware. One thing I liked are the alert tones. Better buy Samsung galaxy m series. This phone is good for gifting... Gifting parents or dumb girlfriends

"
"

  it's a very good product in the market at a reasonable and affordable price.  i had purchased it for my kids for online classes and it is serving the purpose very well.it's 5000 mah battery is good. overall its a best buy.

"
"

  It seems i received a defective piece and now after the purchase of 10 days the mobile works automatically ... When I call amazon they are saying return policy is over and they cannot do anything... It really lack of services and amazon should take action on this because they are the one delivering the product.. Really disappointed and helpless ...

"
"

  I previously gifted it to one of my girlfriends. Now I bought again for another girlfriend because all are equal to me. The phone is good because it has a good battery backup time and good performance. But only disappointed me because it doesn't have a fingerprint sensor. I compared the phone with my Galaxy S10 lite and found a huge difference. From the display to the performance, all feacher in the S10 lite is awesome.

"
"

  Overall, the product is as described except the charger, only a 10W charger is included in the box.I think the handset is bit heavy though I have not checked the weight of handsets of other brands in this price range.I will write a detailed review after using it for some time.

"
"

  Seems like software problems with deviceVery bad experience i had with mi really disappointed. Customer care not responding don't know what should i do now.. Request to amazon please find some way..

"
"

  Best in this segment in terms of battery life and other features. don't have IR blaster, camera is average. keep min 1GB RAM space empty to run high end games Turbo game booster option do the job.Need to see in the long run.

"
"

  Phone is okay, basic phone with 2gb, smooth UI, but I remember xiaomi came up with 5a it was smaller and weigh lesser than this. I purchased this phone for my dad, its too heavy and slips a lot other than that it's okay.

"
"

  The phone was bought for the daughter of an employee to attend online classes. She is extremely happy and able to attend online classes.hence the purpose & objective for purchase has been fulfilled.

"
"

  Product is all-over good but it will be helpful if seller provide the tax invoice or purchase bill in some hard printing material. It will be useful in future to us.

"
"

  This product is very good.But after 20 days the phone was 1st time hang.Now it takes almost 3 hour to be fully charged.Sometime the touch screen is not responding,after restart it works normally.Due to lockdown and current situation I can't go to the nearest service centre.So I am very upset.Please advice me what I should do.

"
"

  There's no fingerprint reader, it would be good if they'd have mentioned it, but i gotta say that I'm amazed by the face recognition reader, it's a lightweight gigantic phone with powerful processor.For the budget, it's a worth buying. Just go for it!!!PS - I just received it so wait for the further update.

"
"

  Bigger battery, nice processor, good camera. Budget phone in this price segment. It's quite ok for the daily staff. The build quality and the back panel is the main highlights. But quite disappointed that no back cover is in with phone.

"
"

  Just a couple of days latter, the phone started behaving abnormally. Application would open on their own randomly. Seemed liked some spot on the touch screen remain pressed and it kept opening up apps. Had to reboot it everytime to sort this out.The phone otherwise works smooth. But this above problem has occurred a multiple of time which has soured my experience.

"
"

  I have not tested the Mobile couz its a gift.But hats off to Xiaomi for bringing phones in this price point with so much specifications.Its a high time for Non-Chinese brands do something or loose the market to China !!

"
"

  Phone quality is good and battery life is also good ..in this range 7499 ... 5000 mah battery and dual camera all are best...Bt only a thing there is no finger print...... Only face lock.. bt it's okkk...It's best phone......

"
"

  This is my 3rd Redmi Phone. I had Redmi 2, Redmi 4, and this is my Redmi 8A Dual. The only drawback what Noticed is Finger Print Missing. I have  lots of apps which require authentication. In my Redmi 4 I had finger print So I unlocked easily all my apps without entering the password / PIN. But in Redmi 8A Dual, I have to manually enter all those keys. Its really pathetic sometime. But other than that I didn't found any other brand who is offering  3GB 64GB for Rs 8999.

"
"

  Superb Phone. Value for Money. MI is always a trusted brand in India. Excellent battery life, faster processorfor general use,  good call quality,  Camera is also good. Go for it guys. At this price level, no other phone can beat this phone

"
"

  Awesome battery backup...Best camera in this price ..Processor is working good not best above average..Overall best in price...

"
"

  It is a good phone and value for money. But itsCamera is not very good.It has high perfomance and great battery capacity.But it has no fingerprint lock system. The phone is very smooth and it has several other quality. The phone can duplicate one app to double.all over it is a good and value for money.I like the product because it is smooth,high battery perfomance and high phone performance

"
"

  Worst product. But more disappointing is Amazon service. The phone started malfunctioning after a few days. First it started hanging and then began off and on all on a sudden.  The problem started just before an hour of scheduled replacement. Initially I thought it is a temporary problem. But when I discovered that the problem is permanent I tried for replacement. But the return window had closed just 5 minutes earlier. Because of 5 minutes delay Amazon didn't care for my repeated request.

"
"

  Very poor product within 4 months the mobile hanged and when took to service centre and they flashed the memory and restarted it after 2 more restarts one more given to service centre and one at home now again hanged Service centre is now recommends change of mother board. When there is a repetitive issue within warranty should not the equipment be replaced however now after warranty the problem is mine

"
"

  When package arrived , got feared like this could be dummy item (junk) by the way it was packed , inside box edge was scrapped , In order to be safety measure , started recording for opening the box , phone was fine for price paid , packaging skills need to be improved by the retailer , when it travels long distance ,packaging matters all on the product.

"
"

  I am facing the screen flickering while using ICICI Mobile banking. is there anyone who is facing the same problem.and any guideline to solve this .so many unuseful apps are available.unable to disable like stock Android...better to go with stock android phone

"
"

  The phone doesn't have a fingerprint scanner but then again with this price range, I did not expect it to have one. Battery life is really good. Even with the dual camera, the quality of pictures suuck really bad. Using Instagram for pictures will help on this device. The 2 GB ram is not at all sufficient for a smartphone these days. If you're shifting from one app to another, the phone lags. Even when you back to home screen after heavy usage of any app, it lags.

"
"

  Nice product with good battery life.For normal use,browsing, you tube, and other uses it is good choice.Redmi mobile are value for money. In affordable prices you get much more.

"
"

  Display quality, camera quality are very poor. App icons on the screen appear hazy. I wasted my money.

"
"

  this phone is very very e nice and mid range is super best value for money phone redmi 8a dualthis phone in battery super charger super display sound quality superb but camera very very badspecial thank you For MI India and Amazon all team very very very thank youthis phone mid range very nice price and me e recommended this phone purchase you all of you

"
"

  This is a basic notch smart phone.... Good for middleaged useres or normal basic user...Front camera is good but rear camera is not that much good... but good for this price... Battery life is so good... but no fast charging... And finger print scanner( may be u will not get  finger print  with any phone in this price range )...  Bought it for my uncle... Look wise its soooo beautiful... Processor nad working is average

"
"

  Recently purchased a week back... Very poor battery backup... The company is claiming 5000mah... It will it is not even 2000mah....it doesnt even last for more then 6hrs...withour even usage... Very poor product... Please dont purchase mi products... Worst

"
"

  Its so worse that when product performance is not good there is NO OPTION TO RETURN. I couldn't even place return order on the day it got delivered. The reason given is so stupid: ""It contains battery, so can't be returned"". Come on, expected something better atleast. Worst ever experience to me after using Amazon for 5 years.Please think twice before ordering anything valuable on Amazon. This would be my last order

"
"

  This is defective products touch automatically worked  Amazon seller cheating a customer defective products send not purchase amazon and seller apprilo seller  you purchase other site I used this products 10 day but today hang automatically  I going to xiaomi service center but not accept it is defective  I blame you fell down this mobile but not fell down this is the modus operandi cheating a customer and Amazon 10 returns period end  seller repair products send me

"
"

  The build quality seems to be good. But the performance is nowhere near what it should deliver! Hasn't even been a week and it already is showing signs of slowing down...

"
"

  MI Remote not working. I purchased Redmi MI 8A mobile phone 8 Sep then replace it again i purchased same then it arrived on 20 Sep that same mobile's MI remote not working and some other was i facing then I raised the complaint. That also replace after it mobile arrived on 4th Oct. In this mobile phone also not working MI Remote.I would like to suggest you, if you are going to use all features of MI Redmi 8A then don't go for it.

"
"

  The phone is absolutely great. I got the phone in 6550₹ in Amazon independence sale. The camera quality both rear and front is great, 5000mah battery is a great advantage with fast charging. Although the processor is old but seems to be working smooth. The phone back panel matte texture feels absolutely great.

"
"

  After 2 month phone outgoing voice not working,And customer service is Redmi not proper responce, they provide only 10 day service not 1 year serviceI recommend don't buy this phone because of customer service

"
"

  Good phone for the price paid...budget friendly for online classes for students...But be aware...I bought it thinking that XIAOMI is making phone in india...but it's actually importing it from china...and further more only replacement option is available... no return policy..

"
"

  Good phone at this price with a large display and a 13mp+2mp rear camera and a 8mp front camera a 5000mAh battery. Big drawback is the absence of finger scanner. But a good product over all.

"
"

  The phone started acting up as soon as it was turned on--the camera doesn't work (as soon as camera is turned on the screen goes dark!), the phone wouldn't ring for WhatsApp calls, the WhatsApp video call function doesn't work as the camera would make the screen go dark. Do not buy from Appario Retail Pvt Ltd--I don't know why AMAZON allows these kinds of dishonest retailers who sell defective products on their site! Very bad experience.

"
"

  Great phone in this price range with sd439, battery life is good , it comes with C type charging facility it is a good pointPurchase only for basic use not for gaming.

"
"

  It will be in the form of brick in your hand, UI sucks to the core, still there are betterr options, face lock is a joke. the processor is way old could not handle multiple task. Does not able to support dual band in WIFI. Think before you guys buy it

"
"

  Battery is good but processor is slow work.Sounds quality is average.Wi-Fi connection is very bad. OTP generation is very bad ofter one minute late arriving OTP SMS.Finger print sensors not provide.First time users can take this phonePhone design is best👍 in blue colour.Overall good phone in this Price range if service center service is good.But I am not satisfied this phone.

"
"

  this mobile we have 3 pieces ay home, using since 8 months, and it works like a charm in all media, gaming also work without any problem. best phone in the market, USB-C is a bonus.

"
"

  Everythin is good...!!I got it @7649rs during primday sale...!!But processer is low i.e 439SDCamera is as per value of money...!!Battery is good...!!

"
"

  It is a good phone. Nice and superb in model, and long life 5000 mah battery, absolutely good for gaming. It provide full screen option and swith option is nice thing. Camera is not out standing but very good. Dual Sim, dual camera and smart face lock. Good in quality, power full glasses and smooth. Advanced features available  here. Not only is good phone but also it's helpful. Low cost but quality is very good.

"
"

  This device has great battery life.But it's volume buttons are not working properly, after a week.Full of ads.But other features are good.It has no any fingerprint sensor. As well as ""face unlock"" is very slow.Don't buy, if you are a gamer or college studend.I recommend you redmi Note 7s or 7pro, redmi Note 8 or 8 pro.This smartphone has very low RAM.which is not sufficient for a student ...(Multitasking)

"
"

  I bought this mobile for my Grandmother. As per her usage, it's quite good but when it comes to usage by me. It wouldn't meet the need. Camera quality is pretty average but it is decent as per the pricing. Battery life is good. It easily gives around two days for normal usage. It's handy and perfect for normal users overall it's a good mobile for normal users.

"
"

  Nice phone in such an economical range. Battery life and camera quality is good. Fingerprint reader is also quick and easily readable. Screen size and phone storage is also ok. What else could one get in such a price range.Nice phone for those who want in the range of below 8k.

"
"

  The phone is good for usual browsing or low end games. You can play high end games like PUBG on low settings still with a small lag. One of cons is it doesn't have a fingerprint reader but has a 2D face unlock which works fine. Camera quality is okaish, what you expect from an under 10k smartphone. Best part is its 5000 mah battery, also supports 18 W fast charging but comes with 10 W charger. Overall a good budget phone.

"
"

  Device is very good in this price. Touch is not that fast. Meets needs of basis Android well. Earphone and back cover should have been included. Sound quality is loud enough. Overall grade phone.

"
"

  Can blindly buy this mi product for the UI, looks, resolution, battery life and the economic price. We received 10% discount during the independence day sale. Cant be happier! Go for it!

"
"

  Lovely product at lowest price

"
"

  Waste of time money and energy. This Phone did not even last for 10 days

"
"

  Superb amazing phoneUnless sd 439 no heating issues not foundBattery backup is amazingBut it have 10w charger on box super phone but only it has 2 gb ram it is not enough for gamers  and also it a good phone for average user camera quality is super and face unlock is faster best battery  backup for normal users sometimes  it hang

"
"

  Redmi 8A dual is a better one but this time price is higher than normal. I purchase it Rs-8200/- which should be around 6500- 6999. Due to necessity i purchased it.

"
"

  Budget Smartphone, very good performnce, I booked for my relative. He is using it, no complaint from him. But camera littile bit dull.  Other wise great smartphone in this price. Go for it.

"
"

  I have been using Mi phones for couple of years and happy with my experience. So I blinday went for Redmile 8A dual which is really affordable with big screen long battery life and sleek design. Thanks amazon

"
"

  Phone us superb at this Price range. No phone is Better below 8k.Though it is a chinese phone but se Dont have any swadeshi phone in india. So Better to buy this phone if you have less money.Bought it @6500₹ at sale..Battery is super Awsome.. Camera is so so in this Price Its Very good.Dont think much just go fir it. You will Definatly love this Beautiful phone specialy blue one.

"
"

  The Redmi 8A phone's camera quality is stunning with long battery life. FM and sound quality are fabulous. Looks and ocean blue colour is better.The main thing easily changes with other Indian languages. No lagging for games.

"
"

  I brought this phone for my mother. The interface, sensor, camera quality is great and other features are also nice.  Easy to use.If you want a budget phone then you must go for this one.

"
"

  I am reviewing it after 2 months of usage...i will definitely say the battery life is amazing ..But the phone is lagging too much...even you cant play normal games like clash of clans, garden escapes ..also you can see so much lag while doing multitask...like whatsapp fb youtube..Camery is avg ..you cant expect great camera in this rangeBut i will suggest realme c3 ..c3 is way better than redmi 8a dual device..

"
"

  No fingerprint,. No infrared..OK but.. Given hardware is also bad.Camera worste.Sound quality is bad.2gb ram its my failure choice.Its just a phone with basic features.I don't why. Corporates finally blam customers. They want to enjoy the blood of customers to make money.Waste of money.Degraded features.

"
"

  While the phone is very good at this price, from processor and features perspective, annoyingly the charger came alongwith is pathetically slow....I had put my phone on charge for half an hour and the charge moved up just by 3%. Need a replacement of charger pls.

"
"

  Speakers are not powerful enough and call quality is poor .. returned product and got refund thanks to amazon

"
"

  No back cover, no screen guard, no fingerprint sensor, and no earphone in box, very bad camera, weak plastic backside. The screen broke after falling from 1 meter distance. I'm very unsatisfied by this phone. Also this is cheap china mobile. Avoid buying this phone. Don't waste money on this phone. Put some more money and get samsung, lg or apple mobile. You will regret after buying this phone.

"
"

  Battery is good enough. But camera is third class..camera is not as i expected in a 7500Rs. Phone. If you make call in speaker mode then the other side would not be able to hear you properly. One more..if you use few more apps then it's use to getting hang. Very disappointing..😣😣

"
"

  I was not fully confident to purchase phone on online. That too 8000 up to.. With Amazon I had a hope.. They are best and trustworthy.. Hence its proved.. .. I'm so happy..  I got sea blue. . I love the color. . Camera quality is sooo good.. Battery life is amazing.. I chargd 96 per onday before yesterday .. Yesterday full day I used my mobiles.. Today still have 38 percentage. . .im sooo satisfied with this product.. Thanku amazon

"
"

  There is no fingerprint reader but the battery life is amazing of thumping 5000mah and the camera quality is also nice with zooming capability up to 8x. Overall the phone is nice. It has a nice design and is large enough and I think it has infinity display and I think it is better than the price though I am reviewing it on the day I got it I will edit this review after 2-3 months of usage.

"
"

  Happy with the product.Look wise,function wise and battery wise this product is good and if you are looking for a decent phone for regular use then can easily go for it.It provides many features at much lower range than many others which are charging you higher for same stuff

"
"

  The phone is very good for single hand use.The screen size is perfect for watching videos.Design of the phone is also good.We r getting type C charger out of the box and it also supports fast charging.The camera quality is decent for the price range.

"
"

  Using it for last one week and performance is very bad. Can't even use the WhatsApp. Hanging regularly.

"
"

  Pros:Good Battery lifeCompact and easy to handleExcellent Design in its segmentCons:Little bit slowVerdict:If you are a basic user go for it.....If you are a gamer it will disappoint you...

"
"

  Worst product this is, hanging problem since purchase, I never thought MI phone has such quality. I never suggest anyone to buy this one. Processor is too slow.

"
"

  I would say the camera qaulity is better but not the best at this price Point. Battery is Excellent but sometimes it feels like that the battery is 4000mah and one Major problem is there is fingerprint however the face unlock is awesome all over things are Great but the price should be at 8000 not 8999 . I AM using it from 2months and there is no hang problem but android 10 update battery is running fastly

"
"

  No finger print reader.Very good battery life.Average camera( better with Google cam app than the inbuilt one).Truly worth money product in 7k range smart phones of all brands.I bought 3gb 32gb for 6999 don't know why they are now selling the same 8.3k .Any way good phone and not for high end gaming.

"
"

  The returned product has the same problem as before. Not a got phone to buy. This phone has a very slow and bad processor, it hangs or crashes ALL THE TIME. The plastic used for theconstruction of the back is very cheap. You cannot use this phone with patience or Calmness. It is a very bad phone. I do not recommend you buying this phone

"
"

   I ordered and got delivery.For first two days it worked fine. On third battery was at 10% and I opened the WhatsApp, then suddenly colored strips started appearing on screen. Not just WhatsApp, but for google also. See attached video for details.I asked  amazon for replacement but they are asking me to send it by courier in this lock down times.Pathetic product..

"
"

  During this pandemic, I had lost hope that I will get a premium smartphone under 9000 rupees but Amazon made it possible.  No doubt performance of this mobile phone is quite good. Battery life is awesome. Camera quality is not very good but if you look the price of this phone it's ok. Screen appearance and sound quality is also up to the mark. Fingerprint scanner is missing in this phone while fingerprint reader is working well.

"
"

  Worst phone 👎👎👎👎👎👎 not purchase it please..... Redmi is a cheap company fake battery performance and no chroma boostHangs a lot after few days of purchase ......, worst ever

"
"

  Superb phone. this phone I purchased for my 13 year old daughter for her online zoom classes. Two time she dropped the phone from her hand but thankfully nothing happens. This proves that this is quite hardy set too. She is happy with the phone because she don't have to charge it every after each class like before. One day full charge means no need to charge for nxt 2-3 days. Super.

"
"

  Very avg product. Got it for 8300 ..3/32 gb. Camera 2/5Display worst 2/5.Battery life 5/5.Performance 3/5.Audio (speaker)3/5.Overall 3/5.

"
"

  Don't be fooled this mobile isn't what they are showing!!  Battery isn't 5000 mah coz it hardly works only for one day...camera quality is not that good specially of front camera!!

"
"

  Best in this Price. Design is Amazing. I brought Sea Blue colour. Camera is Awesome, Portrait Mode is Outstanding. Battery Life is Really Good, easily last for One and Half Day even if you use your Smartphone Continuously.Now, the MIUI 11 is best SOS Based on Android 9 Pie.You Should Really Go For It.You will not be Disappointed.It is Best in this Budget.Very very very Happy...........🤗🤗🤗🤘🤘

"
"

  Before When I used redmi Note 5, I can't call any body at particular area...But now  BSNL tower is displayed and i can call everybody ...and camera is so good...Battery life i charged yesterday at 2:00PM 96% ... tomorrow till 10:45AM , 89% display , in Between cap i used data 2 Hrs, speak 1 Hr,

"
"

  All the phone specs in Redmi 8a Dual are great! but Redmi 8a Dual phone has a primary camera of 13+2 mp and  secondary phone camera of 8 mp. But the pictures clicked from the  primary camera are only 12 mp and the pictures clicked from secondary camera are only 6 mp.

"
"

  It's too good smart phone at budget price but there is no fingerprint scanner, slow processor but it's quite good at this price point and redmi provides type C port and 18 watt fast charging support, good grip design which doesn't come in other Brand smartphones.

"
"

  Good mobile but its made in china manufacture not made in india, so I am not satisfied. I heat china.

"
"

  I have already used redmi 4a which good for one and half year but after that phone started issues of touch problem and ghost touch problem, i frequently heard from friends who using redmi phones.Now new phone itself a problem though it seems not a great problem but led backlights in screen cleary visible in bottom. It seems okay now. But in future not sure about that. Will see for next few or i will return.

"
"

  Battery is average not good enough as given in specifications.As per specifications battery backup during video play back is 34 hours but I guarantee that you will have to charge it thrice in 34 hours.Charager becomes heat after 30 min of charging. And according to battery charger has low capacity to charge.I don't like this phone.I will have to return this phone.

"
"

  To be honest with you guys rhus phone is superbI am actually a heavy user an thus phone is perfectly perfect at this price. Battery is fabulous camera is just so clear (better then vivo and oppo) and display is also big but it only lacks at fingerprint by the way apple 11 series also doesn't have fingerprint so thisphine is perfect.Believe me guys this a smart choice and smart move too

"
"

  I am giving a Delivery day review!Looks good and I hope it'll work good as well! Used YouTube for a while and it got a little hot, I hope it's not a bad sign or something.And yaa it's a good phone at this range.

"
"

  User guide - Not able to read because of very small letters  and illegibleWarranty details not knownWhether this is having Finger print  identity>Detailed booklet on instructions and about REDMI 8A  dual 3 GB / 64 GB Storage not available  These items may be arranged for my referenceDisplay Brightness level  automatic adjustment  case is not clear

"
"

  I bought it on Apr.. now Jun 2nd... It's getting too heat... Not able to use it more than half hour.. it's getting too heat . Am not happy with the. Product. ....

"
"

  Phone performance good under this price. But the facelock feature is unlocking the mobile at a slower speed. Sometimes recognizing the face but not unlocking just shows facelock verifying, i need to enter the password to unlock. Facelock feature not working properly

"
"

  At 6500 price best phone I get the camera quality is also nic with this price and the over whole features is also nic.Night image is also ok ok because at this price we cannot except to much clearity but the image we can see is nic.

"
"

  Excellent product. Battery performance very good. Cleaner app effective. Feature of auto turn off at night and turn on in morning (savev on battery) effective. Camera is also very good.

"
"

  Battery and performance are good comparing to the price but 1 disadvantage is that this product came with 10w charger adapter this make it slow charging so you would prefer a batter charger adapter like 18w adapter but overall it is a very good product with less price👍

"
"

  1) Just its 2 days, now call center is saying hardware issue is there since it's not operating properly.2) Camera quality is poor3) Auto brightness mode doesn't work properly4) Wifi doesn't get connected, they are asking to check at service center.

"
"

  Very bad phone

"
"

  Pros:Battery life of the phone is good.Quick charge optionPicture clarity is good.Cons:Camera quality is not so greatLil heavierWith in a month , the power charger isn't working.All the videos are played in slow motion as there was no sync between the motion and the audio.. I had to install the VLC for playing the videos.

"
"

  On box the list of contains was there. In which gorilla glass was mentioned.. but on opening of box, we found only poly cover of gorrilla glass but gorrilla glass was missing.. which indicates that the item gorrilla glass was intensively removed from the mobile box before dispatched..  which is directly cheating with customer... not good... the dispatcher should be blacklisted..

"
"

  this is ultimate budget mobile in this range. and the battery life is just awesome. my mom use it . and she needs to charge it once a week. just a quality mobile

"
"

  Battery drains a lot. 5000 mah .is useless. even with average usage, it lasts only a day. Even in stand by battery drains.Its only the price and decent performance that I have given it 3 star else would have chosen only 1 star.

"
"

  Low Quality mobile...Don't buy  1).Sometimes Touch not work  2).Camera Quality is Average  3).Many adds are coming  4).App icon size are large  5).Does not moving files to sd card Overall this mobile is Waste...Battery only best but all performance are poor..touch not work,No sd card move i am very irritating...Choose another mobile at this price range

"
"

  Received the cell 8dual in proper condition. Thanks Amazon, but the warranty card, user guide and sim pin was missing. Please do the needful. Before dispatching please go through the item . Rest is fine

"
"

  This is my first time to order this phone online. It is really amazing. My friend told me not to buy phone online due to defect but i took a risk n i saved 1000/- bcoz market price is around 8500/-But they were wrong there's no defect.I really love it... N battery life is also very good... Thank you Amazon❤

"
"

  I was Micromax Q334 which has 5 Mp. camera which is far far better than RedMI 8A Dual 13 MP camera. Battery backup is good but it takes so much time to charge , approximately 2 hours for full recharge. and rest are good

"
"

  Pro- Slim and easy to handle- best in price- overall experience is goodConc- Mi unwanted apps-dont like MI operating that muchIt should be easy to use

"
"

  Battery back is very poor. It takes 3 hours for fully charge the phone and drain in 10 hours with normal use.Don not go for this mobile if you want good battery back up. The battery claim is false.

"
"

  Friends, never buy this mobile, it's a fault mobile. My mobille facing battery problem and display issue after 8 days of delivery. Both MI and Amazon refuse to replace. MI service is very poor and so guys never choose this mobile. MI service center informed me that 10 days replacement warranty is applicable for Flipkart only. I don't know what to do. Anyway I cheeted by MI and Amazon.

  Very comfortable product.  Good battery life also. They not provide phone back cover.  The fresh phone how to without use of back cover.  Please add back cover in this type phone.Camera clarity average. Face recognition perfect. Sound clarity, display size also good.  No fingerprint reader in this product then why you add  Star review on fingerprint reader in this page. I can't understand that.

  Good average phone little costlyCan get infinix with major upgradeCamera not worth itProcessor fineMemory fineIts averageIts too costly

"

  One of the worst phones out there, it started to hang in just one month I didn't expect that with a new device. All of a sudden the screen goes blank and keeps blinking battery is decent, camera is ok for this price but the performance is worst and one more upsetting factor that i did noticed after receiving no fingerprint sensor

"
"

  I loved the product battery life is good. Display and camera qaulity is ok.But I am very much disappointed with dilevery boy (Satish) he was very rude, even he was not following the rules for Covid-19. I have done shopping in past from Amazon and flipkart but never experienced this kind of behavior from dilevery boy

"
"

  I buy this mobile . battery  is awesome more than 1 day it's life.Battery charging time - 2.30 hrs with 2amp chargerCamera - averageProcesser - slow  while simple usage its frame dropTime for opening an app back to home screen is 2-3 sec which is very high. Some bug are still after update. Please resolve it

"
"

  Battery life goodPerformance not goodSome times it's not properly respondingCamera not a good oneAlways signal loosing

"
"

  Overall worthy smartphone• Battery life so good• Camera is good for daily need purpose• Display better result• fingerprint not available but faceunlock works.

"
"

  In this price range it is a good choice. Battery life is good. No lag till now. But camera should be better. Low light photography is very poor. Camera always suffer from low light. Selfie camera is decent. Overall a budget phone for day to day work. Don't expect more from this.

"
"

  If you thinking to buy a budget phone redmi 8a dual is great package.negative side-1)You don't get fingerprint scanner2)Even it is redmi phone you didn't get IR Blaster means there is no option of MI remote.3)camera is decent. Portrait mode is not that good.4)This phone supports 18w charger but you get 10w charger in box.5)you didn't get case in box.

"
"

  The display started failing 2 days after the return period ended. Started to automatically open and close apps. Screen would randomly go black, go to the lockscreen and unlock automatically. Since it started failing just after the return period ended makes it seem like this is a planned SCAM. I would recommend not to buy this phone.

"
"

  What a awesome service by Amazon!! Even in this pandemic time, really impressed.Amazon delivered the product on time.Phone is really good, I gifted this phone to my parents and they liked it. Reasonable price with all features.

"
"

  This phone one of good this price range, c type charger, dual camera 8 mp front, 5000mah battery

"
"

   Good battery backup, decent camera & bright display at this price point but there is no finger print censor and the other hand delivery time is also once again 60% faster than Flipkart.

"
"

  This is the best mobile I have ever seen under budget, ❤❤❤this mobile is good for all , easy to use, various themes are their . Good camera clearity. You can play pubg without any glitch. Two sim slot. And the speaker is owsmmmm.. The sound is tooo loud... Which is great for music lovers 😍😍😍😍. You can go for it.... This is like""CHOTA PACK BADA DHAMAKA""

"
"

  this is China product and take a lot of confusion while operating. Apps and software not updated as per new Indian rules. Getting confussion and delay in operating the phone

"
"

  No finger print available.Battery life is better.Camera is average. sound quality is better. Overall it's avg phone with this range of 8k.

"
"

  It has no fingerprint.Battery life is good.Camera quality for this price segment is very good.No lag.Overall it is a good choice for this price segment.

"
"

  No ir ,no fast charger in the box,but great phone with good processes and battery,camera ok ok, look great,in hand feel owsome

"
"

  At this price range this is the best phoneYou can do decenet gamingCamera is awesomeBattery backup nearly 10hrs continuous useCharges in 2 and half hoursPhone is very strong with tempered glass I dropped nearly 10 times from 5feet height no single damageIf your budget is below 10k this phone will reach your expectations

"
"

  Samsung m30 is best performer for a 10k phone. Camera is good and chinese phone cameras are nowhere close to it. Massive 5000mah battery with 15w fast charging. Only issue is battery heats even after a 5-min call. Samsung please bring some update to fix it. SAMSUNG is amazing.

"
"

  The phone comes at an attractive price yet offers good features, particularly the battery. There are many apps from mi that might get a tad annoying, make sure to switch off notifications, an easy work around.Camera and sound quality are decent. Phone performs and responds well.

"
"

  Display remain in that photo shownThat mobile does not any activities.Care persons not contact to that problem after inform to customer careVery worst responseCustomer care every time I call they told transfer to senior and after 5 mins call will be disconnected they rotene 5 times my money total waste.next time I don't buy on that website total cheet

"
"

  Best mobile in class because it has Qualcomm Snapdragon processor and type C port with 18w fast charge , and Qualcomm quick charge 3 support, it's better then redmi 9A, Redmi 9i.

"
"

  Satisfactory phone because of it's price!! A fine offering for ₹8000 phone but the issue of hanging continuously and the high heating problem makes me angry!!!No heavy apps are installed still after only 1 month of use such problems are arising....It's better to go for ₹10000 Or more but not this one!!

"
"

  I AM FIRST TIME USER OF REDMI PHONE.AT THIS COST THIS PHONE IS BEST.P-HONE IS WORKING SMOOTHLY.ALL GAME ARE RUN SMOOTHLY. NFS RUN OKAY.BATTERY LIFE IS GOOD.CAMERA QUALITY IS NOT GOOD. BELOW AVERAGE.FINGERPRINT READER IS NOT AVAILABLE IN THIS PHONE.

"
"

  Good product,only 2 colour variant only available to improve the colour variant and then,expand RAM space and ROM,Good looking,I feeling like heavy weight,Quick charging all very good working,No fingerprint,Good camera,Gaming performance was ok,Battery life good

"
"

  Mobile hanging intermittently, sometimes touchscreen not responding. Camera quality is not satisfactory. I was using different models of Redmi mobiles since last few years. But it's bye bye time... Amazon not returning this mobile within stipulated time frame 26/08/2020 from purchase date 18/08/2020.

"
"

  If you planing to get best looking phone for nearly 7000 redmi 8a dual is the best option to buy among all others. Display is right on part, battery is awesome, supports fast change 2.0 (18W), cemera is decent for video calls, and fells like durable device on hands.

"
"

   Mobile is so light weighted,and thanx to amozon to delivered timely. Camera picture quality very good and i give 10/10 for performance.

"
"

  Its a really good model at this price range. With good battery life and great camera quality. It also comes with 32gb internal memory and 2 gb ram which is also quite good. Fast charging and gaming speed is good too.And redmi is a very well-known brand.If you don't want much high featured mobile then its for you. Give it a try

"
"

  Pros-First look: Great built quality, looks like a 13k phone not 7.5k.Display quality seems like full HD.Camera quality (front and back) better than Motorola g5s plus(13MP) and portrait mode is great at this price point.Cons:Slightly lagging appears.

"
"

  Very bad. When calling the voice of other person is not clear. I think some kind of defect with my handset. Kindly guide me how to claim warranty?

"
"

  The phone was working well for a few weeks. Then suddenly started shutting down in middle watching a video or WhatsApp. It's been only 3 months since I have purchased this one. This was the first experience of smart phone for my Mom. Can't be a more pathetic experience. I need help to exchange this. I am unable to find a way to reach out. Please help.

"
"

  Noooo fingerprint s there..bt ask fr d ratings of finger print 😂..therz nly face unlock .... Mbl S gud enough with some latest apps.... Overall pick up some gud n reasonable..

"
"

  i bought it for my grandpa. this is good phone. not a gaming focused phone but will get your daily task fairly easily.it heats up during charge but its normal for 18w charger.if you want a daily driver and if you dont game that much then go for it. if you want a budget gaming phone then check realme c series.

"
"

   Hello Sir, We are buying a phone from amazon and it delivered on 10th sept,2020 and return timeline complete on 17th Sept, 2020 and today i found a problem like attached photo and videos. we are used this phone in my hand and  accidently stop working. I hope please replace the product as soon as possible.

"
"

  Excellent phone in budget segment... Camera quality is good.. Battery life 52 hours and 528 hour standby.. No lag.. Good performance.. You can use Google lence without any app.. Good quality.. Dual volte and VOwifi support.. I loved it also thanks to Amazon for fast delivery.. Miui 12 update has arrived in this phone. The phone you should buy in this time..

"
"

  I am writing the review after 20 day use. This phone have no finger print sensor. But battery life is ok. Camera quality also good. Selfi camera not so good but budget wise it's a good phone. Everything is very good in this range.

"
"

  A mid-range phone with every necessary features. The design of the phone is superb. An all day use phone and you don't need to exercise regularly with charging your phone. The audio quality and mic works at par. However, if you are looking for a camera phone it may not reach upto your expectations. It's an ideal handset to gift it to your parents.

"
"

  As expected an Mi product of topnotch quality. Unmatched configuration and features at the price. Best value for money. MAde in India.

"
"

  I bought this product for my grandmother. She doesn't need high end configuration. It has been 15 days or so and she is very happy with it. Battery life is really good and phone is decent looking. Easy to work with. Nice for day to day simple usage. Cannot comment on heavy duty usage as my grandmother doesn't need it.

"
"

  Don't have finger print sensor. Battery life is good in new condition butI have listened that battery life will be degraded after use of some months.Also one bad thing is the poor quality of pictures taken by rear camera instead of having dual rear camera. Pictures taken by rear camera is too dark in quality.

"
"

  So i bought this phone on 5th march 2020 for my mother. It went smooth because anyway she doesnt use phone apart from call and whatsapp. Now since 2 days the phone is not starting. It hanged first, when i she switched off phone to restart and again tried to start, it failed.its been 2 days the phone is dead. Its hardly 2 months. Highly disappointed. Poor quality of product.

"
"

  This mobile is nice but there is a problem in it when I call someone it couldn't call then I have to reboot it and then it works I have to reboot it at least three times in a day . It's the major problem in it but the camera and battery life are superb. There should also be a fingerprint scanner. I give the mobile three stars from five stars .

"
"

  Great mobile at this price rangeAmazing look.. Love the sea blue colour.. Good Battery Life and Good Camera Quality.. It doesn't have a fingerprint reader but Face Recognition is available

"
"

  I ordered a 2 GB RAM version earlier for one of my family member that worked fine. But this 3 GB RAM version started giving problems after 2 weeks of use. The screen often starts blinking and the phone has to be restarted again and again. The return window was closed. I think this is pathetic phone. Don’t buy it.

"
"

  I didn't find a finger print reader in this phone it was strange for me , the battery life is good , camera quality is ohk ohk , the phone have a face reader for unlocking the phone , I didn't tested it till now I would update the review after testing it , but it's good for normal use ..

"
"

  After using this about 6 month. I got this for 6500.Its really worth it in this range. Except camera every thing is upto mark.Battery backup is awesome.Paisa Wasool.

"
"

  the looks from the front is as same as redmi note 8 u’ll not find any difference, battery life is fantastic, audio quality is also good overall good smart phone and in this price point u won’t get the phone like this.Bit first let i thank and appreciate the Amazon, by sending this phone within no time and in good packaging

"
"

  Dont go buy the review of other if you spend 7.5k on a phone and you expect a performance of a flagship phone than its your problem.. This is a decent smartphone works flawlessly.. Camera is ok ok not that great but overall I didnt feel any lag ot any problem till now its been more than a month... Recommended👍👍

"
"

  Very good phone this price and very good specification and features this price...But fingerprint sensor not......

"
"

  Phone battery is not charging. I kept the phone for charging like crazy,,, but it's not working. Even if I charge for hours, it'll be having just 20%-30% charge. I really need a replacement. Please someone help me. It's been just 20 days I ordered this and return data also crossed. I am so much disappointed with the product and return policy of this device. Someone help me...

"
"

  This phone is one of best entry level  smartphone under 10k with some valuable features like type c port with fast charging, Gorila glass 5 protection and Snapdragon processor better then P22/P25/A25 of mediateak .....

"
"

  Just waste of money. Worse experience with Amqzon ever. Display is shaking automatically after few minutes of using. Worst thing is that it charged 27% only after long 14 hours. I foumd no fingerprint whereas it's asking to review fingerprint.

"
"

  Its good in this price range and my cousins were using this from 2years,yet times it become slow but restart helps to fix things.

"
"

  First of all its chinese phone but manufactured in india and we indians have no option when we are choosing any phone below 10k so I found this redmi 8A phone. Phone quality is superb with 3 gb ram and 32 gb internal storage with Microsoft sd card and AI camera is awesome. no hang just use it and go for it.

"
"

  Good Phone at this Budget. Sound is clear and loud. Camera quality good at day time. 5000 MaH battery is better than other phone, may operate for whole day with good usage.Except for the chinese apps and update, not sure, it would update or not.

"
"

  After approx 15-20 days of use... It's screen start getting freeze and sudden shutdown unable to access anything further...When contacted to customer care... They just keep it for 7 days amd replaca as it is...It is still giving problem while using yet customer care doesn't replace or help with anything.

"
"

  The mobile was really good at this price.There is no fingerprint reader,camera quality is ok and the battery was awesome.It stays for a long.Budget friendly  mobile.It is not fit for gaming and it is a better choice for online class.Hope this review helps you:)

"
"

  (1) I guess camera used to be better in the earlier Redmi phones.(2) The buttons on the side (volume, power) gets accidentally pressed often. Sometimes fast boot opens.(3) Phone doesn't feel very safe to hold. I constantly feel like I'll drop it. Perhaps it's due to size.

"
"

  Within 3 months of purchase the phone crashes and hangs a lot . It’s used for only whatsapp and YouTube mostly. Such simple applications cause phone not responding and requires a restart . I bought this as gift to my mom who handles it so previously yet the phone is a huge let down my first redmi phone. Doubt if I will ever return Redmi. Hope some patch or fix can improve it

"
"

  3gb 32 gb : Without any heavy app. installation and even , phone get hang ,reboot is only option in such cases.Except above issue , battery, camera, sound ,design,display are pretty good in this range

"
"

  The colour of the ph is outstandingBut it's have only the outlook,Inside the phone is not satisfiedLittle bit of lag, 720 pixels regulation,☹️DisgustingOnly the battery is good but the charging time is 2.50-3 hours to get 0 to 100%Really not satisfiedBetter you can buy resmi 8a in less price but same phone

"
"

  Display is destroyed so not available this item when available

"
"

  Fantastic phone quality, great experience..First time i am using redmi and great performance at this Price..Qualcomm processor fantastic job and battery perform first class, camera also good job..And I would to true say the phone quality fantastic.

"
"

  #Desh ka Dumdar Phone by Redmi India.I suggest to you go for this. Amazing Mind-blowing Product. Also, In this phone fingerprint reader is not present. But for budget phone award goes to this under 7500rs. Superb

"
"

  Good Phone, so far working fine, in this price range you can pick this phone, has good quality camera and ram management is also fine.Best part its battery life. In normal usage may be 2 day backup

"
"

  MI phones are worst in quality. It's hanging too much even when I only have 4 simple apps. When in loud speaker mode, even speaker and Mike both seems to be not working properly only after 20 days. Phone is having heating issue & they are having worst service center as they never provide quality service.

"
"

  This is Really Amazing in this price point 😘It has recently received Android 10 update.Battery runs two  days while light usage.Camera is more than average.Long Shots are Awesome.It is enough powerful to run GTA SA, Free Fire on Ultra settings.In my opinion it should be priced around 7,000₹.

"
"

  I bought it for mom..c is newto andriod.. In this price.. Product is good.. Camera n fingerprint reader is good.. Battery depends on use.. Apps..

"
"

  I bought this phone for my dad he isn't a gamer so I tkoght 2GB RAM would be enough and yeah it's enough for daily useBattery stays for a whole day or two with full brightness YouTube streaming I don't know  about that..There wasn't a fingerprint reader that was a bummer but yeah for 7.5k it meets the requirements

"
"

  Very good mid range phone. But the camera quality is not up to the mark. Pubg and codm runs smoothly but gyroscope is not good.heats on charging like any other redmi phone.

"
"

  Awesome smartphone at this price range. Nothing beats it. Nice smooth processor for normal usage. Not for gaming though.

"
"

  Good battery backup and it gives more than 8 hours screeen ontime for one complete charge but in case you are interested in Wireless FM Radio then this is more than dispointment. Xaiomi should be sued for such wrong publicity about  wireless FM radio.

"
"

  this mobile is super everything is great battery backup camera display all is avesam and its design is very impressive I like this mobile very much in this budget is mobile is superb you should for go for it

"
"

  Picture quality is very much bad for the bad camera quality.I sugest try other option which is better then this phone.Most problematic MI stores also, every time required update.

"
"

  Nice mobile according to price, camera more than average, everything is good I am happy with this product. Only one problem at the time of incoming call, when we cover proximity sensor, screen turns off and only rings, we have to on screen from the side button, it's solution is you can on the raise to wake option. Thnx to Amazon

"
"

  I 1st time purchased mi phone & as I thought it’s exactly like that WORST PRODUCT, software issues as you can see in upload video, apps automatically start running, very irritating experienceRequest DONT WASTE MONEY TO BUY THIS PRODUCT

"
"

  Not good for long use, battery camera not up to the mark

"
"

  Its a good Budget mobile .Battery back up is good , it really is 5000mAh battery.Camera is Good but  dont expect High quality Pics .

"
"

  Goodphone

"
"

  First impression ,Good .I bought this for my mom(Amma). Detailed review soon

"
"

  Schedule power on and off and find device options are not working though I followed direction provided by mi customer care and factory data reset. There is a problem in software. Company should notice the problem and customer should notice. Thanks for the replacement initiation.

"
"

  It is lightweight and I like the look. Battery backup is nice. Camera is average. Not like dslr. 😁Processor is fast.

"
"

  Phn isntoo gud but amazon cheat me they cant give me charger.  Nd when I complained they said to self return this product

"
"

  Overall This Mobile is good.1. Bad Camera quality. Selfie camera is good.2. Good battery life3. Slow Mobile4. Back side cover quality is not good5. Better to have good quality pouchIt is suitable For normal usage people

"
"

  Very good battery back up. I watched You tube for 1.5 hours and only 10% battery consumed.Good mobile in such a cheap price.

"
"

  I will never suggest anyone to buy this phone. Now a days quality of mi phones are getting degraded. Phone is hanging a lot. Also some inbuilt feature like screen shot is not working. Not a good phone. Only plus point is battery life, which is good. But apart from that other aspects of a good phone are very poor.

"
"

  It's one of best mobile in low budget, but not good quality of camera. Good for online access, surfing. Not good for video game player.

"
"

  Excellent product ..!1) good touch quality2) HD screen3) Good camera quality4) nice design.Finally great product & affordable price.!

"
"

  I received a used device. The pin wasn't there, cardboard was broken.After switching it on, it didn't ask for my Google account. Home page ooened straight away. I cleared the data and it locked me out saying someone's MI account is already linked to it and now I'm unable to even turn on my phone

"
"

  Performance has been docile after 3 weeks of use.Battery is indeed exceptional along with several other features that make this phone distinctive in the marketplace.However camera quality could have been massively upgraded.Finger print sensor should have been present.Otherwise Okayish in the price range.

"
"

  India's most third class brand is Mi. Not satisfied with this product at all. From the very first day I faced issue. Recent app key does not work properly. Recent app areautomatically dilited. Poor camera quality. Setting is very complicating. Full of 3rd class features. The only satisfactory thing is its battery.

"
"

  Super phone with great look and battery back up. Phone pic and video quality is great.

"
"

  It's a very good product for budget price in lockdown,,battery very good, this is Speacilaty of this product,, over all this phone is very good,, I am very happy to get this product due to study purpose. Thanks to Amazon to gave cod on this product,.

"
"

  Product is good but it's not made in India .It's made in ChinaClearly written on boxIt's imported from China .

"
"

  Just after 42 days, the phone started misbehaving, from any section of mobile it is coming back to home screen automatically in less than a minute, MIUI experience is not good, faulted phone is sent by seller and Mi company, Amazon please look into this, please compensate, I am hurt

"
"

  Battery capacity given 5000maH but actually not like that, battery capacity actually proven for 3000mah. The draining speed is as same as 3000 or less mah. Overall the performance is good but in a term of battery capacity little compromised whether it's internal falut or battery problem that cannot be understand.

"
"

  I purchased 3Gb RAM Variant at rs 8500 and I think it is overpriced as it's camera, processor, screen quality is very bad.

"
"

  The screen of the Redmi 8a is pretty good under Rs 8,000 price phone.I've purchased it for my Mom🥰...She is very happy with this SURPRISE.t has a light weight,thin that you are very easily use for the daily life. 🙂But not really satisfied with the camera quality😢

"
"

  Sir product is hanging a lot from past 20 days . I reboot & updated it 5-6 times still problem continues.  Also there is no replace or warranty option given by you. Extremely disappointed from amazon service . Please solve my problem .There is something very wrong with the software of this product.

"
"

  Till date no issues, good working. I don't think there may be any problems. Good one in this range. No fingerprint reader. Camera is average.

"
"

  the phone is so much laaging .we cant play pubg ,ff  smoothly .the best thing i like  in this phone its battery performence and the back design .

"
"

  i dont why sellers took 8 days for shipping. what he was doing (preparing for refurbished?) i didnt get free basic transparent pouch in side the box. he is too late to ship the product. Apario pvt ltd

"
"

  This phone is good only very for normal user 2gb ram hang this phone sometime.but note its battery is awesome call quality is good speaker is average, design is also good not slippery camera is average, and what u get in jst 7499

"
"

  Best Phone in the price segment. Built quality, camera performance and battery backup is awesome. It's Redmi so we get everything best in affordable price.

"
"

  The phone is good but the camera quality is very poor. It has a written 13 megapixel camera, but it takes pictures like a 5 megapixel camera. No good photo can be taken at night. Overall a good phone, but not recommended for those buying for the camera..

"
"

  I have doubts regarding manufacturing and import date of product. As Date of manufacturing is June 20 and date of import is July 20 . How it's possible that phone is imported in India in July 20 which yet to be come

"
"

  I bought this phone on 3rd march. Returned on 7th march due to mal function. They sent me one more cell but im facing the sane problen. It always tell 'find device closed unexpectedly'. Due to this problem im unable to open some apps like whatsapp and youtube. Even im unable to open camera app some times.

"
"

  Best phone

"
"

  During incoming call display is not showing , we have to unlock the phone to see who is calling.we also wnet to MI center , they reported sensor is not working properly.Please don't buy this phone . Increase the buget if possible to buy other phone. my friend also bought this phone and also received defective one.

"
"

  It doesn't contains Fingerprint reader, Battery life is OK. Again We are so dissatisfied with the camera Quality. Overall this phone is not so satisfying but till it's ok to have this phone !!!

"
"

  Got the budget phone @7499 For 2 gb-32 gb , truly needed for Online Classes, I also suggest to sale at previous discounted price with more choices. Phone is nice, with clear display, Sound is good, Network connectivity is good. Basic needs fulfilled.

"
"

  I purchased it for my mother ... a really very nice product...cam quality with AI  is also good .....Battery life awesome... sound quality good...MIUI 11 supporting system....fast charging with 18 W plug....Go for it..best budget phone

"
"

  Dear everyone,Please don't purchase this phone. after 15 days of purchased, the display not working properly. Automatically many app opening and closing without touching phone. Some software issues is there. But they telling good option within the budget range. Totally waste of money...

"
"

  A budget smartphone , not expect much.Display is quite satisfactoryBattery lasts for one and a half day if you use constantly.No finger print sensorNo gravity sensorCamera is above averageLacks night escape modeCharger heats up a lot during charging

"
"

  Battery got discharged in one night. It was just kept aside without sim and wifi. Will check other features after the phone is charged.

"
"

  The mobile is only 7 days old & the processor is malfunctioning.The product could not be returned within 7 days as the return request could not be processed due to tedious policy of self check could not be materialized.Very very disappointed.

"
"

  Product and service of Amazon is good. I have purchased this mobile in Rs. 8299/- marginally Price is high.Drawbacks- Pre installed app like mi account, mi browser, mi store, mi video , mi pay, mi credit, shareMe and mi community. Which leads to unnecessary memory's cosumption.

"
"

  Nice phone at this priceProsBattery lifeGood displayGorilla glass 5 protectionSD 439 energy efficiency 12nmMIUI interfaceConsAverage cameraNo finger print censorOutdoor visibility in direct sunlightNo IR Blaster

"
"

  Bought this for my mom.  This mobile set is dazzling and has great appeal.  Such a good set at such less price!!

"
"

  It serves all my needs. Display, camera are satisfactory. Signal capturing capability is really good. Touch response time is normal. Battery life is also sufficiently good.

"
"

  The whole mobile set and its functions are very good as compared to it's price. The phone doesn't have fingerprint sensor but camera and battery life are very good. Satisfied with my purchase.

"
"

  Good product and worth ...ideal phone for only calling and whtsp ..since it has less ram and storage ... suitable for eldersAverage cameraBattery doesn't drain muchA bit slow ..not really slow!The back cover has a rough texture , better grip

"
"

  Product was working fine, with this budget got a 3GB RAM,32GB storage mobile and Camera pixels also more as compare to competitors products,It’s simply worthy. And Good product.

"
"

  This product is exalent. Mi 8a dual phone is very intalegent mobile, superb quality. Mi is company quality first rank really great technology, with dolby, dts sound in ear phones. Thank you amazon, ilke phone, one million ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐,,,,,.....

"
"

  This is the best mobile I've ever bought. One thing that i like about it is... It never hangs and processor is damn fast mtlb amazing😍.  But the one thing only i dislike about this device is the design.... When it comes to its design its a Lil bit odd. But overall this phone is amazing.

"
"

  Dislikes: not two day battery, screen resolution Dotty, MI apps useless and can't be uninstalled.Likes: best option below 10k, better than Samsung, satisfactory ownership.

"
"

  Not expected this quality from MI, only after 7 weeks of using its sound speaker is not functioning, mobile also hangs frequently, also getting hot during long calls, worst quality got.As a true customer, If possible, request MI to change the mobile with new one.

"
"

  Budget mobile.....Worthy for money....Little bit disappointed by the processor ....Could have been upgraded but speed is very good for normal user rather than gamers......Especially battery is tooooo goooood .......Type C charger is an advantage..With 18w charger

"
"

  Ear Speaker noise is very less as compaired to Redmi 6A always need to use on speaker. Unable to heard properly so creating miss understanding. Good product in this Price. Battery life good but need to also improve. Selfies camera is awesome.. As compaired to other same specifications this is very good👍👍

"
"

  Good quality. Finger print sensor not yet used. Battery and camera are good. Pre-installed apps are a problem

  I would rate this product ZERO.. pls do not buy this product waste of money..After inserting the sim the phone is always switched off.  Due to this had got the SIM also changed but the issue of the phone continues.. same sim works on other phone perfectly fine.

"

  Budget phone under 10000 and specs are quite impressive but when it comes to camera it's almost similar to redmi 7a...and battery life is okay-okay...fast charging support with type-c charger...face unlock okay-okay...performance amazing...attractive look(sky white)..₹8299 is worth it..

"
"

  It's a amazing phone📱. It's battery has a great power which is long lasts. And fast charging is also super duper. There's no fingerprint reader but other securities performs there best. It's camera quality is good and best selfie it's auto focusing is fantastic. Loving it

"
"

  Battery - 10 marksCamera - 7½ marks.(In this budget price it's worth but the image can be more brighter)Performance - 8 marks. Has good dual 4G speed and shows no lags while playing games.Overall - 8 marks

"
"

  Don't know, but I ordered this phone and returned it.Received new piece again.But same issue with this phone as well , microphone issue,Not able to hear voice of person who is on the other side.Now going to return this phone and will purchase other phone but not Redmi 8a

"
"

   After 9 day phone display is flickering. When I called to customer care, they simply told me we can't help you, your return window is closed. No support received from Amazon.

"
"

  A good phone in this price range. Back camera got good quality. Front camera is little bit low quality.

"
"

  Backcolur is White & its awesome, camera is as always average for redmi products but processor is good compared to same range realme mobile.

"

   Very bad quality. Speaker and mic  Very bad quality. Speaker and micVery bad quality. Speaker and micVery bad quality. Speaker and micVery bad quality. Speaker and micVery bad quality. Speaker and micVery bad quality. Speaker and mic

  Nice product by Redmi. A budget smartphone for everyone. Nice battery backup. Nice design. And Amazon service is also very good, delivery agent is very polite. Overall a good experience with Amazon Service. I hope Amazon will provide this flexible service everytime and to everyone.

"
"

  Looking great product 👌.I am looking back cover but hasn't in.selfi camera looking great.packing is good... delivery is well...it has 20 gb storage with phones applications... Snapdragon 439 good processors in the mid range....8300rs...thank you amazon....

"
"

  Hanging, screen not working properly. Didn't work any swhich at time of hanging.very bad feedback from my side.

"
"

  Good phone. Bit bulky may be because of big battery. Awesome back camera, average front camera. No lagging. Overall good budget phone. Ideal for elderly people.

"
"

  Pretty bad performance. Battery drains out in few hours (max 4 hrs) camera quality is not great could have gone for other brands with the same range.

"
"

  Basically A phone for Basic Usage.. If u are a Gaming person don't go for this one but if u hv to give it to ur parents or u urself has limited usage u can give this phone a shot.Totally worth it.Value for money phone.

"
"

  After using for 1 week, I am writing this review the fon is awesome, the battery is good and the camera is also good, mostly it is good fon for the parents.

   5 दिन में Redmi 8A dual का touch खराब हो गया । शिकायत पर कोई रेस्पॉन्स नहीं।मेरे खराब अनुभव के आधार पर redmi का कोई फ़ोन नही खरीदे। 0 स्टार

"
"

  Older text messages goes up. This phone has a limited memory for text messages. It approx saves 100 messages per number. Beyond a certain limit, older messsages diasppear. If I knew this, I never buy this phone.

"
"

  The phone was fine but the charger was not workingIt is a faulty charger. i thought the phone was fine but with a new charger too, charging is not happening. I realised too late that the piece is a bad one.The changing port of the phone is itself faultyIt is a diffective peice

"
"

  Though Phone battery is great , the internal storage is wasted by installing too many un necessary apps. the worst part is that the in built antenna stooped working within few days of purchase and now has to use head phones for FM receiption.

"
"

  Good one. Had ordered for my dad and he seems at ease using the same. Appearance, colour, display, battery are all fine so far

"
"

  2gb ram gets phone slow.

"
"

  Low in price, big screen, good for normal use. People who have low budget, this is very nice. Also got it on emi, it also went smooth.

"
"

  No fingerprint sensor, normal charging speed, camera not bad, pubg play with gfx tool in extreme setting smoothly but gyro repond veey slow (not work properly).This phone made only normal usage.

"
"

  Overall performance of the phone is good, The battery when compared to other phones in same price range is weak , camera is pathetic, display is not bad ..

"
"

  Excellent phone at competitive price. Great value for money. People looking for low budget phone with comparable features of high end, can blindly opt for this phone and make it ranking no. 1 in mobiles

"
"

  I regret buying this after I got to know that I could have bought note 6 pro at slightly higher price, which is better phone then this one :(

"
"

  I gave this phone as a gift to my Sister and she loved the phone. The charger received along with the phone was faulty and did not charge, I called up Amazon however the entire product had to be returned and was also out of stock, there was no option to retutn the charger and hence I did not return it.

"
"

   Defective piece delivered and now not replacing it.because problem had seen in mobile after 10  days of deliverybso now they are not replacing it... Very bad service.. Not satisfied at all

"
"

  Damdar product at this price range. Battery is very good last long front camera is awesome, back panel and its colour looks very cool. Overall very best phone at this price range just go for it

"
"

  Liked display and notch area. Gives feeling of large screen. Happy about battery too. Cam is descent but could have been better for this price range.

"
"

  Battery life 3 days.smooth display. Classic look. fast charge. Good camera.average performence. 7500 price. Low padjet High range mopile

"
"

  Redmi 8a average budget friendly phone...i bought 2 redmi 8a dual.i felt some issues on automatic brightness .Normally it will be work under the light conditions but when i put it on,suddenly the brightness getting low then it will never back to normal light..both devices have same pblm..

"
"

  Good phone in this price range . Can’t expect much from the phone as it is sufficiently loaded.

"
"

  in this price range this is best smartphone for basic use.Its runs PUBG also on low settings but basically its not made for gaming purposes.This is best non gamer user like me who used only phones for calling and normal streaming purposes.And speaker of this phone is quite loud also.I likes this phone.

"
"

  A very good mobile, camera is not good,But performance is good,Recommended for day to day work

"
"

  I bought this phone for my momThe smartphone comes with a 5000 mAH battery. Large screen good camera.

"
"

  Overall a good phone with quite interesting specifications but not for youth they need more powerful processor and other specifications

"
"

  Good mobile at this price I mean it's such a budget friendly phone. And it's battery backup is great.

"
"

  Finger print sensor not available

"
"

  Thank you amazon.time to time delivery super.packaging is excellent.redmi note 8Adual.3gb,64gb mobile is super.

"
"

  Amazing product at this range i don't have to say battery backup is amazing and cameras just do what they are suppose to do, don't expect much from them, overall quality is amazing i love it.

"
"

  Faulty Product - The charger is faulty and the phone does not charge at all. Unfortunately I got the product during the start of lockdown and now I’m stuck with a faulty product without option of being able to return! Extremely unhappy and feel cheated !

"
"

  Good phone in budget price. Need to improve camera quality. Especially front camera needs improvement. Can give silicone cover atleast and charging can be improved fast front

"
"

  I just bought 2 days back..phone is ok  . But they have sent corrupt charger which is not working at all.. please replace it ...it never get charges more than 2 %... or refund my money  .Amazon  should take care of the products before delivering it . We can't wander to courier office often n often.

"
"

  The product was of very bad quality. Tried to connect Amazon on call, but due to lockdown, it was not possible. When I was connected, I told them that volume button is not working, they said try after restarting the phone. That problem still persist and every time I have to restart the phone to operate volume button.

"
"

  This phone gives you a lot of features which doesn't come in other brands in the same price range. Battery is good, camera is okay and fingerprints works just fine. If you have low budget you can go for this phone.

"
"

  Redmi 8A Dual I bought this mobile some months ago & after using this I can bet this is the best mobile phone in such a cheap price...Battery life is good Camera quality is ok ok but only Fingerprint is not in this phone otherwise good for working people.

"
"

  Camera: The camera quality is not good when considered for portrait shoot. Images are not sharp, you will find the camera to be tiny and not a great build.Body build quality: Worth the moneyRAM: Okay, as its not a gaming mobileAI face unlock: Good

"
"

  This is made in China. Imported in 07/2020. Beware.

"
"

  Top class 👌spec's in it's price.well design 🤟by Xiaomi . Value for money.Most of the people who have buy a new phone in this price range they have one thing in the mind that's value for money. And it is that. 🙏Excellent 👍 service by Amazon .

"
"

  Basically  this phone is bought for my mom and she loves it .She is happy what is product  offer to her .But there is only issue with finger print sensor which is not given .

"
"

  Ok ok ,not soo  better go for samsung ...Nothing about this product 3.8 ratingopen light camera  is good 5 ratingBut inside house camera 2.5U decide

"
"

  The Screen starts flickering after use of a Month! Without any rough use of the Phone! Will suggest don’t do for this Phone Rather u can get better of it with MI itself! Such a fault in Screen not tolerable.

"
"

  Worst product. It's feel like brick in hand.. so heavy . Phone hangs a lot and heating issues are there. OS is not fast and remember it produces lot of radiation ... don't go for it.

"
"

  The product seemed to be excellent for one month but then began to restart frequently, redmi customer care executive suggested to visit service centre, unable to visit service centre during lockdown. Pathetic experience for the first time from Amazon.

"
"

  There is no warranty card inside the boxNo ear phones connector tooAnd these days a screen guard and a transparent case are given to customers but in amazon theres nothing

"
"

  It get hang up within 2 week. After rebooting by calling customer care it's running ok but risk remains

"
"

  Review after 3 month useNice phone in this rangeGood cameraGood batteryFeel very good and nice look

"
"

  Dislike  :  Not head phone available with this packing.Like  : we like RedmiUse  : for my daughter.

"
"

  Looks very cheap. you can buy an advanced/better mobile by adding two-three thousand to your budget.

"
"

  it's a good product. face sensor is work very good.  it's camera battery life and over all performance is the fantastic with its price. i am so happy with mobile . back cover is not given with  mobile.

"
"

  In my set I am suffering from lost of network, I don't know why this occurs. SIM is tested on other mobile instrument no problem of network. In this set spoken to various times on customer care all test done as per there instructions but all in vein. Kindly help.

"
"

   This phone is worst......the screen start flickering after three to four days of use.

"
"

  Phone worked fine for 10 days but now m facing problems. Apps getting crashed, Opened my  contacts, Screen was automatically running.  when i called someone, screen goes turned off and did not turned on even after pressing power button multiple times.

"
"

  This phone is great from every aspect.I bought this phone for my mom.She was amazed to see the battery backup this phone has.Camera is good too for the price.If you're buying this phone for your mom or dad, then it's a great buy.

"
"

  The product is delivered in good condition.I am satisfied with the packagingI bought this smartphone for old person who only needs it for primary use such as camera whatsApp and calling purpose. Whosoever is buying this for basic purpose can definitely go with this product.

  Its compact feel better for day today normal usage. Very good mobile for all users who require a handy good looking Mobile which can perform all the task well.. display is good... Most practical phone in this price..

"
"

  Nice phone from Samsung in this price. Display is good . Camera is not awsome but average. Battery will last 1 day with normal usage. N it has all necessary features. I got this for 8999 . So good phone under 10 k.As samsung so last for years.

"
"

  Gifted it for my mother. It is perfect size , perfect placement of power and volume buttons, has dust on phone after opening the box but the box was sealed, same thing happened to me when I bought M31,Pros.* Perfect size* Samsung brand* Good build quality for this price* Android 10* One UI 2Cons.* camera is below average* Average display quality* No earphones in the box* No fingerprint scanner* Takes very long time to charge battery.Will update this review after few weeks.

"
"

  I have compare a samsung, Panasonic, and MI mobile. Mi is better in terms of bettery (5000mah) but all the other specifications are same in this range. I prefer samsung because of brand value and I don't want to buy Chinese products.This Mobile is good for average use and battery last for 24 hour. No heating problem.

"
"

  This smartphone is very handy and responsive. The cameras are not as good as other smartphones in this price but it gets the job done. If you want a very hand and easy to use smartphone this is it. The quality is the best in this segment.Pros:1. Small, handy and light weight2. Display is good3. battery capacity is good4. fast and responsive for normal tasks5. Durability ""It has a plastic body and looks premium but extremely light and durable""cons:1. Not for gaming2. charging takes 3 hours 30 minutes3. cameras are not good compared to other smartphones.

"
"

  I have been using it for a week.I came back to samsung after using Redmi note and it feels so much better.The touch and feel iss awesome. Fast an smooth operations with anroid 10. Lots of intelligent features at this price like limiting screen time for each app and winddown function in the night etc.. Camera is decent for normal photo. Sound and speakers are good for clear conversations.The only thing which might be a downside for some people'could be compact size of screen especially if you're used to big screens. It might take some time to get accustomed if you are a frequent movie watcher.Overall it's much better than the so called value for money brands like Redmi Oppo Vivo Realme etc which are primarily winning customers by offering more storage battery and big screen but lack performance.A good to buy phone for  9000

"
"

  Its not value for money,  just passable,  its very tiny phone, not wider enough,  please see length and widths specification specifically.Very slow chargingNot good cameraIf your are planning for students for class, its worthless.

"
"

  After watching so much negative reviews from paid youtubers about this Phone, I dare to buy this one because of my guts feeling, and I'm happy to have this phone. DON'T GET TRAPPED UNDER NUMEROUS FRAGILE FEATURES IN CHEAP PRICE BY OTHER COMPANIES. I ONLY WANT DURABILITY.

"
"

  The description said it had fingerprint recognition facility. But it didn't have the faciity. And that was one of the main reasons of deciding to buy it.

No earphones came with the mobile and even the mobile looked old. Hated it .NEVER BUY

"
"

  This mobile has software problem it seems, within 10 days of usage it hangs a lot. Also it has mic problem, when you attend the call the caller at the other end won’t be able to hear you, you need to restart the mobile for couple of time then it works. I can’t use it like this for longer run, please help me to return the product, I will handover the mobile by doing factory reset. Please review and help as soon as possible.

  I bought this for 8990.. Now it has reduced to 8399.. The product is worth the price. Before buying make of the purpose of the usage.. This is a budget phone and is not for gaming.. My dad needed a phone which has decent battery life and whatsapp for official usage.. He doesn't use it for anything else... I wanted to buy only Samsung phone. I finally concluded to buy this..Pros.1. Good battery life.2. Size is not big. Hence easy to carry. (This might be a con for few)3. Doesn't heat while charging/ normal usage. Though few have complained of heating. However I didn't experience any heating issue.4. Low sar. (0.61 W/kg- head). I particularly check for SAR value before buying.5. Doesn't heat on normal usage.  This depends on how u define ""Normal"". The apps my dad use are few banking apps, Whatsapp, YouTube, and for office use6. Smooth UI7. Android 10 with latest security update.8. Good call quality. Even after hours of calling it didn't heat up.Cons.Can't complain about these coz you get what u pay for.. Lack of fingerprint scanner and slow charging are to name a few.. Samsung can include a screen guard too. :)However getting a Samsung phone for this price is really worth.. Samsung= Quality & Reliability.Samsung is an innovative brand. They spend lots of money for R&D to bring out new feature. So when I pay for Samsung Iam paying for innovation. :)I will be buying M31 s in next sale.. Samsung 4ever! :)

  Don't buy any Mobile from Amazon if you are not fully aware abaout the product. After buying they are not entertain you for returning/replacement. Pathetic customer support by customer care service.Very upset from Amazon, they are only making money from India with cheap policies.They are asking to download an waste app in your phone which has 1.8 rating on play store and asking you for permission of  your personal information.And yes this mobile has very cheap quality and only sold due to less option in Indian market. Only samsung mobile left in market if you don't want to buy any Chinese mobile. Not a single Indian mobile available in own Indian market.Samsung making good money with its cheap quality mobile phones.

"
"

  Not worth the price at all! I am writing the review after using 17 days!Pros.1. Handy piece tho a bit heavy it's good to operate.2. Front camera is cool.3. Good face lock AI.Cons.1. Worst camera ui and I don't think this time samsung has their quality over the camera the back camera is worst.2. Not a worthy battery life.3. Too highly priced.Totally I'm not satisfied!It's better to buy any other model other than this. If not the new realme model is of the same price almost of this and has super good features. You can choose that or any other model from Samsung itself but don't choose this model coz there are lot of flaws in this... so its not worth the price.Hope my review helped..

"
"

  This is just to get your job done. don't expect too much .Pros : -** display is good.. no complains.** sound okay** can uninstall bloatware except few samsung specific ones.** very handy. form factor is nice.** Battery easily lasts for 2 days on normal** Samsung One UI is too good.Cons : -1) Camera very big disappointment. Only expect good pics in outdoors under good lighting conditions.2) Charges very slow.3) Having a tough time finding a good coverNote : No tempered glass or headphone will be provided in the box

"

  I have purchased for my mother. She is learning operating android phone 1st time. The item is handy as the screen size is smaller than ours 6"" phones. On the performance side the set is quite fast. Battery is getting  heated during continuous use. Just a week has passed sonce the phone is in use. Further details may be provided later.

"
"

  it says camera is 13MP but when you click photo it seem like it is just 2 or 4 MP.very poor camera quality.

"
"

  Pros:1. Look and feel2. Buttery smooth display3. Build quality4. Rear camera quality5. Good performance for minimal app usage6. Value for money7. Samsung !!Cons:1. Fingerprint scanner not available2. Internal storage could be bit more3. Front camera

"

  Samsung M series, great phone in this range all are value money. Let's see here the SAMSUNG M01 phone: red colour , thin design make gives beautiful phone look. It has optimised performance with low power consumption that's gives you longer battery life time. It does not have finger tip sensor, bought it for grand parent who do not actually need it, some time in emergency you don't wish to have these security features.  At this budget with exchange offer got a great deal a brand new phone with loaded feature at 6500, isn't good. Front camera is average, clarity is good however back dual camera is good, inbuilt animated shot can give you different experience. The phone having good voice and sound quality, inbuilt and expendable memories are now improved than older phones gives you the freedom to be entertain. I love the display quality of samsung this is unmatched feature. Phone size is small and compact so can easily carry it in pockets, or keep it with other phone if you keep two phone.If want to have phone at low budget or secondary phone for back- up with reliable brand it's a good choice.ver all it's a great quality branded value for money phone.

"
"

  Poor audio quality. Ordered it for my parents but both microphone and speaker volume is poor by designInstead of having the speakers at charging jeck thay have it on the vack side. When call comes no one is able to hear because the phone is keot on its back.Despite of buying via prime fulfilled, Amazon refused to return item.

"
"

  My Personal genuine reviewSamsung Is overcharged for this phone, the brand which most people love in india.Samsung is Overpriced his every Phone in india, using anti China sentiment of Indian people.If you buy this phone remember it will take total 4 Hours to charge Fully😂.Charger is only 5v 1amp.Samsung price 8.5k for this phone and doesn't even satisfy now days criteria.Camera is also Bakwas😂.Resolution quality really you will hate after using because I think it's 480ppi Resolution. Because also have mother HD+ phone which is more clear than this m01.Performance is also not upto the mark.All disadvantages in it.But there is Only one advantage if you also antichina then you get 'Samsung' only 'name' from non Chinese brand.That's only advantage 😂Buy if you want to let samsung use anti china sentiment and let samsung earn more money via overpriced.

"
"

  The product is good and worth for the money given. I got it for 6950 after exchanging the old Samsung.Battery life is good even after continuous use . Display and camera are very good.  No lagging.  For a middle income group it will be a good asset . No fingerprint reader.

"
"

  Nice, does what it's supposed to do. Dual-sim works well. I use it as a backup phone to my Galaxy Note, and it works well.

"
"

  One of the best smartphone under 10kI bought one for my dad it works very smooth no lag or hanging issue and it's also surprise me with a gaming review I tried few heavy games and that worked really smooth camera is goodOverall I loved it in this price range thanks  Samsung and Amazon

"
"

  Bought this one on 25th August, reviewing on 22nd September.Battery life with a pocket friendly size is the only good thing about this phone! The headphone jack is behaving so erratically...it automatically reduces or increase the volume of audio/video being played and despite pressing hard on the keys or trying different earphones, the problem persists...even after a factory reset.Also, the charging socket has stopped working properly, so now I have to place my phone at a specific angle or keep holding in my hands in that position while charging the phone!Screw you Amazon...7 days replacement policy is just not good enough!

"
"

  This mobile was delivered on 23-Jul-2020. After 9 days of use, the volume key and power key is not working. Worst product and services by Samsung and Amazon. No option for replacement. They are distributing defective products. Please refrain from buying this mobile.

"
"

  Now this is a great phone for its price point ( under 9k )Battery is great, display is bright, speaker voice is clear ( not the loudest but works 9/10 cases ), Great UI/UX of android, average camera.There are alternatives available of this phone and you can check them out too but you won't be disappointed with this one.Things you will miss -Wifi tech is older - it won't catch the ultra fast wifi networks ( still works well with average wifi connection )Bloatware - a lot of unnecessary apps ( doesn't annoy you but still feels forced )Average camera - works fine for good daylight pics but the focus is slow and is pretty bad in low light.Old charging port - Does not use the type-c standard now and no fast charging.

"
"

  This phone is meant for a very small group of people. First of all, it is a very small display compared to other flagship or even other low budget phone . The only reason one should buy this is either they love Samsung ui - android 10 or they need a backup phone with very less radiation. The snapdragon 400 chip set is a very outdated chip which does not provide even close to the performance from other phones from this range. Well , after this you might think that the camera might be great. Wrong again , the 8 mega pixel camera can maximum take photos uptown 4 mp(which is not of even good quality either) and the front facing camera is just trash.Talking about spec sheet, out the the 32 GB, you only get 20. And out 3GB ram , there is only 1.5 GB ram which you can use. Running simple applications take about 2.5 GB ram.Battery is decent(finally something good about the phone) but it will ofcourse be so ,as there has been compromises is every other part of the phone.  In the box comes a 5 watt charger which takes ages. At an age where phones can charge uptown 100 watt, it's totally unfair that samsung gives us 5 watt charger. There is no inbuilt screen protector or back case.The dual camera setup is just for name sake. Please don't buy this phone for the camera or performance.Like I said earlier,  this phone is useful for old grandparents or children with limited usage. With is budget,  you can get better phones such as narzo 10a or oppo phones which are better and give relatively good performance too.The phone doesn't lag much but due to the small screen , online class or videos will be hard to attend. If in case you plan to buy this phone , try contacting a physical store as they can give you a better price. Another problem I noticed, the charging cable is smaller than the normal size. Makes it difficult to charge.

  Superb product, Battery back is very GoodGo for It rather than our ""enemy country's"" products, you know what I'm talking about 🙏

"
"

  It’s a value product by Samsung at a decent price in less than INR 10K . I personally like the screen size 5.7 better than 6.4 in other M and A series phones. Anyone can go for it! Has got a rich look ! I’m happy with my decision.

"
"

  Its a value for money product from Samsung. Though I am not a big Samsung Fan however this model is a superb option when your pocket is tight on budget and you need a good quality smartphone. Phone build quality is sturdy and gives a nice feel in hand and looks good too ,Battery life is good , camera quality is sufficient, screen is good but no fingerprint reader. I really like the screen size (5.7) which is far better that the big phones (6.+ screen size) , because of bit small screen phone fits well in hand and gives the easiness to use with single hand. Samsung should have also provided at least a wired earphone with the phone (should not cost Samsung much) which is missing in the box.

  DISPLAY: The TFT Display quality is good compared to other cheap brands, the viewing angle is also good, does not fade out much when you view it from different angle. Brightness is also sufficient.BATTERY: Battery life is very good. Hours of basic usage (online classes, calls, whatsapp, browsing) and hours of gaming. Using since 15 days, not found unnecessary battery drainage.CHARGING: It's little slow if you are used to a 10W of a fast charging mobile. 1% increment in charge takes 2 minutes and 10-15 seconds approx. But mobile does not heat at all during charging.PERFORMANCE: Zero lag during web browsing, youtube, switching between apps, online classes via skype, zoom & google meet. One UI is really very smooth. I don't play pubg, but it's easily playing games like ""IAF:A cut above"" in ultra graphic settings with no lag or frameskip.CAMERA: The major issue with this mobile is it's camera image quality in low light condition, it's very poor in low light (without flash) but with flash its ok ok type. However the back camera quality in day light or indoor light conditions is good, not soo good or bad, its just good. Selfie camera is not good at all. It needs softwere improvement.CALLS: Call quality is great and loud on both sides.CONCLUSION: If you need a compact, good looking, good in hand feel and durable non-chineese phone with basic to medium usage like online classes, low to medium intensity gaming and smooth ad-free Ui then definitely go for it. However if you want a camera centric phone taking pictures all the day and especially selfies, it's not for you.

  Very cool and decent mobile, as specification smooth touch, good processor, android 10, average camera, less SAR value,  NO heating issue at all. No back cover, no ear phone, charger not modified (old type), no fast charging. At last no signal problem, good buy for Rs 8998.

"
"

  Overall it's an average Smartphone.I would tell you about some basic parameters.PERFORMANCE- This Smartphone is having an average Processor. So, don't even think of playing heavy games like COD or PUBG. But if you are buying for normal usage than it works quite well but lags sometime as it has 3GB RAM.CAMERA- It has a decent rear camera. Depth sensor is on average and clicks normal portrait shots. Front camera is below average so don't expect much from it.BATTERY- It has 4000 mAh battery so if you have a normal usage then it works easily for 12-15 hours once it is charged 90%. One problem is that it comes with a 5V/1A Charger so it takes much time to get charged.One more thing is that it doesn't have finger print scanner.It has face unlock that works quite well.At last I would say if you want to buy a non-chinese smartphone and your budget is around 8.5k-9k then you can go for it. This phone is for moderate use and from my view it will easily work for 3-4 years. And if you want gaming or better specs then either you go for Chinese phones or make your budget large.

"
"

  The phone is Samsung's offer for those who want a budget phone within 10K. In these Covid times, every person wants a smartphone, but there are not many options, what with many persons not wanting to buy Chinese products. This phone is the answer to them. It has all the features a decent smartphone offers, and is not too heavy on the pocket. I sincerely endorse this product and ask fellow persons to try this.

  but now there is some problem in the phone , it's display is not working  well

"

  Best phone at this price !pros-Looks 5/5Display-5/5Sound-5/5Camera-4/5Battery-5/5cons-nothing found still ! will update later!If you are at this budget to buy a phone then definitely buy it , you won't be upset !

  Gud compact phone

  This phone would be awesome if it's price were 6000 0r 7000 but it's price is 9000.9000 rs and still no type c charger.9000 rs and still no fast charging.9000 and still no fingerprint sensor.9000 rs and still pathetic speaker(sound is very low and clarity too is patetic)that too on the back. no phone nowadays have speaker at back.9000 rs and phone looks cheap(bad plastic material is used)in 9000 rs u would get far better mobile than this mobile.if the price would be 6 k or 7k ,i would say phone is good.but in 9000 here we r getting undervaluer mobile with no fingerprint sensor,pathetic speaker ,no type c charger,cheap lookSamsung have fooled their customers.

"
"

  I bought this for my aunt. Performance is good actually. I’ve put lots of apps and the speed was good. Speaker is not that loud but for the price it is good. Camera is bad but for people not wanting it, it gets the job done! I’ve also bought M01 core (2GB) which is way inferior compared to this. M01 core’s camera is worse than this. For people using only Facebook, Whatsapp... M01 core would be fine but for a price difference of only ₹1900; M01 offers a lot more!

"
"

  Like : Right now fast access, feather touch key, good camera and picture quality, excellent customer care and remote access of the phone.Dislike: Some important feature like 'Screenshot' is absent in scroll up menu that is to be brought from Accesibility option of setting and put on Assistant menu. Which should be a ready option in scroll up menus. Incoming phone call sound quality was very poor however that was resolved by guidance from Customer care by remote accessing.Battery life which needs to be more longer.

"
"

  Post 3 days of usage :Battery - Excellent battery backup (goes up to 2nd day effortlessly - gaming not included in usage).Charging - Fast charging is a miss vs competition brands but while using the device didnt feel it as missing since device sustains entire day smoothly so no probs.Built - Plastic built but from the looks alone it feels good (have a red one) not premium though.The size of the device makes it a superb grip and ease of use with single hand.Display & Touch - Display is small vs  competition. Colour/Brightness is decent enough; no complaints at all. Touch is buttery smooth.OS - Android 10 (though not stock android like Nokia) advantage against competition; very few devices below 10K giving Android10 as out of the box. One would experience it during daily usage.Camera - Worst of the lot i guess; shaky, noisy images and videos (rear and front both) .. it was a shock - Samsung should do something about it in the next s/w update.Except Camera rest the device is very good at the price point!

"

  Phone is good as per this price range with samsung brand value but i have more more expectations

"
"

  I am using this phone for more than a week now. I'll try to lay down the pros and cons.Pros:-* Perfect size, best for single hand use and also good enough for watching films and videos.* Battery life is decent, with moderate to slightly heavy usage it easily lasts for a day or more.* Android 10 from the box.* With3gb/32g it functions quite smoothly. No lags whatsoever.* The speaker sound is loud enough and clear.Cons:-* No fingerprint scanner, the face unlock doesn't work well. So you need to depend on pattern or pin unlock.* Doesn't support fast charging, takes around 3.5 hrs for full charge.Some othe points :-* The camera is definitely not the best in the budget but is ok considering the price point.* display isn't amoled but its again decent enough for the price.Finally i would definitely recommend this phone to the ones who are searching for phones in the budget segment with the brand assurance of Samsung and a single hand usable device.

  Superrrrb Phone if u are looking for a backup phone for unlimited phone calls and browsing and watching Videos/Live TV.The phone doesnt have a finger print reader but has face recognition option. Face recognition works very well.I bought this one to give my Google Pixel3 a backup ... A backup friend... For my office SIM... as my office calls are endless....morning 9 to evening 8...The best thing about this phone is its size..i wanted small sized screen phone and also light weight ...so i can use it without headphones/earphones..Great Phone in this price range.Battery life is excellent.I am using this phone since last week and found no issues till yet.I am happy to go again with samsung..after a decade.. M01... is a must buy phone ..Trust me... If my wife losses her iphone again..I will gift her M01 in an iphone case😜...Samsung again makes me brand loyal to him..

"
"

  You have way better options at this price. This phone is pathetic and its cam is scam, I ll tell you how. when you open cam and open wide angle mode cover one cam out of two. You would realize cam 1 is working, now change the view from wide angle to normal and check by covering cam again only cam1 is working cam 2 is a showpiece. I know how it works because I have other phone with 2 cams.Display avg. Battery is good, No option to do screen mirroring or smart view.Disappointed totally and now cant return...

"
"

  you have lots of options available in that prize, I have order because there was a Replacement guarantee but its only if the phone has fault with it, if you dont like the phone on Design or features you cant change! Amazon wont allow! i was ready for buying Samsung M21 if they were allowing me to change the phone, so be sure before ordering the phone.its a Grandmother style phone!!

"
"

  Good budget phone for common people.Overall the phone looks good , at this price 3 gb ram and 32gb space is at best price available. I bought these phone after comparing each model available with 3gb,32gb combination.Features:Value for Money.3GB ram and 32 GB space good enough for daily use.Samsung brand is good as compared to chines phone.Touch sensitivity is good.Not too big in size . can be handled with one hand..Drawbacks:Battery life is okay not great.

"
"

  Build quality is really good. I like Samsung Glance app showing news on our interests in the lock screen. My old phone had fingerprint sensor which is missing in M01 but face lock and unlock does the trick and works well. Likewise, I used android one UI in earlier phone. The only feature that i miss is swipe left from home screen to get Google news feed. But then again, its a software feature. My earlier phone was a 16K costing one and still it lasted only 1.5 years and i learnt that since the hynix eMMC used in device hit its lifetime, writes started failing and so phone became unusable. So, I wanted to buy Samsung this time as Samsung eMMC would be more reliable and would last longer. Snapdragon 439 SoC processor is just right enough for regular phone use. Camera still pictures would look super good provided person holds the phone still and even after clicking needs to hold the phone still for couple of seconds or else, the pic appears distorted. Would recommend this phone for sure as it is sturdy and very good value for money.

  No finger printer reader. A handy phone thats of perfect size. Camera is of poor quality  ,doesnt give the 13mp result . Takes more than 3hrs for charging.The product is good when delivered, no faulty packaging or anything as told in other reviews. The charger too gets heated fast. The phone started lagging even aftr the first hour of use(just a 2sec lagged..like it was frozen),then came back.Overall for this Rs 8k its the perfect phoneand better than using any chinese phones.

"
"

  No finger print option and phone size would have been 6 inch+.  Now a days competitors supplying the mobiles of matching quality with specified features around same price. In order to retain the existing premier position commanding in mobile segment, hope Samsung focus much to bridge such gaps. Overall it's  a nice experience with this mobile  so far and found to be a good value for money in budget phone segment , for this hard core Motorola user since beginning who opted this  mainly due to its OS with latest android version 10 which enables to  access his company applications supporting only with android 10 and above since 1st October 2020.

  Hi All,Please don’t buy this product as this model hang always.  I got this model and used only for 5 days after that suddenly it got dead. when i put in to charge for more that 30 minutes also it didn’t get start. Post contact to samsung support suggested to press both power & lower volume button to start but still it stuck on home screen. You can see the image. Finally Amazon denied for replacement also even after 6 days. i am sure defect in this model so guys request you please don’t buy this product. its my pathetic experience on amazon & on this model.

"
"

  it is a better option in this price ,much better than other Chinese brand smartphone n this range.

"
"

  Nothing great about this phone. All the mentioned features are there. Value for money. Good budget phone. Works smoothly. Camera is not that great.

"
"

  This phone is so under rated. Got it for ₹8400 and I guess I didn't made a mistake.I don't usually play games  so its probably the best non chinese phone. Best for daily use. Battery backup lasts for a day with heavy social media use and light gaming.  Even played COD mobile and PUBG on low settings and the game play was fine.  Charging takes around 4 hours with the in box 5w charger, but can be charged with a 10W charger. Overall a good product where my privacy isn't jeopardized.

"
"

  Samsung at 7,999 with all features, it defenently swipe away all China pieces which don't have quality.Pros:fingerprint reader - face reader is working awesomely so need of fingerprint readerLook and Quality  - excellentcamera quality  -  not too bad.Ok under 10kBattery life-  lasting for whole dayFunctioning -  smooth and fast.Price - Cant imagine more than this.ConsCamera - ok.Overall at this price it's praise wasool.Can take without second thought.

"
"

  It's really a value for money product. The battery, screen, processor which your get for a price tag of 8998 is amazing. Good speaker and no heating issue. However the camera quality could be better.

"
"

  Good entry level Android phone. Those who are looking for basic function and minimalistic features can opt for this manufactured in India product. 3 GB RAM & Battery capacity enough for daily moderate usage. Camera quality is good but not the best when it comes to low light photography. Overall happy with SAMSUNG basic Android phone. Good if you are planning to gift it to elderly people/parents

"
"

  I was searching for a handy smartphone for long time. I found this realesed recently and purchased. Everything fine, if Samsung included  fingerprint scanner, this one is the best small form factory  smartphone ever. If you ready to enter every time password or pattern to unlock (with face masks unlocking with face recognition is not possible) go for it. Otherwise find something with fingerprint unlock.

"
"

  Just got unboxed on 11th Oct. And after 5 mins the phone started to heat up, tried playing game which i normally  play smoothly on 2 gb ram starts to lag. When continuously  browsed for about an hr it would start to hang a bit not much.And  honestly battery  life is superb for this range phone BIG OK to that, camera quality is poor yet doesn't matter i always look bad on cam so dont care abt it much.And here is the worst part of this phone just to get 5-6% charge it almost took 45 minutes is terrible.After experiencing such terrible experience  requested  for refund but AMAZON wont refund me said it can only be replaced. Had a very bad experience. Viewers here if you still wanna give a try on this product then go for it, configuration is good as no deny it SAMSUNG BRAND after all.

"

  Reviewing the device after using it for more than a week. Find my pros and cons below:Pros:1. Battery: Battery backup is super impressive if you are a normal user. I don't play games but have to take calls through the day as I am working from home and I also use its hotspot throughout the day and the battery doesn't disappoint.2. Camera - I know that this is the new age of triple and quad camera setups in mobile phone but I have to say that even though I had very less expectations from the camera it does a wonderful job. The samsung camera app is superb and even though it has limited features it still performs fabulously in daylight and nicely in artificial or low light.3. One UI- The Samsung's very own android skin is amazingly cool and makes the user experience so much better.4. Display- Even though this is an LCD display still the colours are punchy and even in sunlight the display performs well.5. Biometric- The face unlock performs nicely and unlocks the device in a jiffy.You will not regret the absence of a fingerprint sensor.Cons:1. Charger: As it is a 4000 mAh battery the absence of a fast charger is something that hurts. They could have included the 15 watt adapter that they offer with other devices.2. Case: Though not really a necessity, presence of a protective case would have been so much better.There aren't too many cons as this is a really good device for normal usage and you would be able to use it for all your essential needs for day to day basis.

  Very economical, an excellent phone for this budget.PROS...Since it is Android 10, we can apply dark mode and hence battery consumption is less.Also, even latest apps can be installed in this smartphone due to android 10.3GB Ram provides an excellent working condition to this phone. Even Pubg can be played in this phone without any sort of hang.Massive screen with infinity V display helps to see the online classes and movies very clearly.Dolby atmos provides an excellent utility to this phone. Even with a worthless earbud, by using Dolby atmos, it sounds good.It has a huge battery of 4000mAh and also massive  storage of 32 gb ram, which is worthy for a normal user.LAST but NOT LEAST, I'm very happy to hear that this is an INDIAN smartphone designed by INDIANS. Make in IndiaCONS...Even it has an octa core processor, its processor is very low when compared to redmi and realme phones in this price range.It does not have a fingerprint scanner, but has a fast face unlock.Even though it has a huge battery, it has a 2hrs charging time.So although it has some cons, it is a smartphone with many pros and some cons. I like it very much.What about you ???

  I gifted this phone to my parents. Also, It's better phone for normal use as a spare phone. I use Samsung M21 for myself 😊I believe in Quality and not Glossy looks of the phone like the Chinese phone offers in market these days.Plus points• 4000 mAh Battery• Infinity-V Display• 13MP Dual Camera• Android 10 is fine to have at this budget.• Qualcomm Snapdragon 439 Chipset. Minus Points• Camera is not that good• A bit heating issues• Display is so so.. 🙄▪︎Plus, I want to clarify I don't support Chinese products so that's why Samsung Budget phones are best choice phone for your parents. Go for it 🤗It's fully MADE IN INDIA 🇮🇳  so Up to you if you support that 😅 !!Thank you. Choice is yours. I'm happy with Samsung M01 phone for my Parents.

  Bought this for my dad, he likes it.  Its senior citizen friendly.  Only problem is with Samsung bloatware and notifications that are absolutely useless.I have disabled all notifications and auto updates.  Monthly once I update it manually.  The rest is fine. Battery life  is good. Camera is just ok.

"
"

  Awesome mobile phone and I bought from Amazon I got in one day delivery . the mobile everything is good to buy but taking more time to full battery. They wouldn't gave fingerprint unlock and also didn't gave fast charging. But I love this more because nice to handle mobile in single hand .I am using this mobile as .

"
"

  I bought this phone for my dad and he is very happy with this phone.In this range with the product quality it's better than any other MI Phones.Before buying it I did have a look on mi Note 9 and 9A and they were very havey in weight and big.And quality of this phone is better than any other phone in this range

"
"

  The phone is very good, i bought it for my dad because he wanted a small size phone and this was the best ideal size to handle with one hand. I love the software that is latest and smooth. You can watch the video on Tech blast Youtube channel. Samsung cameras are always the best and this is the perfect one for the price. Battery is ever lasting. It works for my dad for 2 days. Just the charger is very slow and no fast charger support, hope to get in any future OTA update.

  Like:One UI 2: twice as good as stock android and equally fast3gb ram is enough for running many apps simultaneouslyDouble tap screen to wake screenGood display. Phone looks like midranged doesnt look or feel cheap.Dolby audio for surround effect in earphonesNot made in chinaDislike:No fingerprint readerBad camera front and backJunk apps pre installed. Had to remove them.Exchanged 2 year old asus lite l1 and got this for 6100

"

  Amazon make fools in the name of amazon mobile sale...just after sale price drops 8400 from 9000.Mobile is ok but slightly higher priced it should be around 8K.Design is not feels like premium Samsung brand and slightly thicker!

"
"

  A budget friendly good brand phone ,i gifted this phone to my father ,Pros:1-camera quality is good in this price.2- 3 gb ram is sufficient if you're not so addicted to picture clicking.3-battery life is good .Cons:1-little bit heavy , but can manage.2-screen size is small as compared to other smart phone in this price range.

"

  Camera, sound quality not so good as mentioned.. Not happy with this purchase. Trying to return from last 2 days but no option is available.. Totally disappointed.

"
"

  Well its my third Smartphone and all are Samsung. Reason is quite obivious it seals the deal everytime with everything under one roof. So reviewing it after 3 weeks of hardcore usage.Pros:1. Great performance. Processing power is quite good, even frame rate syncing seems good.2. Battery Life is awesome3. Stunning Design (Red colour looks damn sexy)4. Value for Money5. Thin Body great benefit for the one's like me who use the smartphone with one hand.Cons:1. Camera seems a bit average due to over bright and filtered pictures. I loved the old cameras by Samsung which had touch of originality. Capturing even the wrinkes and imperfections on your face. Please bring those back2. No Fingerprint Sensor.Overall a smart buy with tight budget.

  This is a rip off by Amazon. It's not even been a month since I bought this phone for my mother and the phone is having multiple issues.. Apps just shut by themselves every few minutes.. Wifi connectivity does not work .. phone keeps hanging and there is major lag.. I had already made a complain that the cover was damaged when it was delivered got zero response on that. Don't expect such negligence from Amazon and as a customer I feel cheated.. !! Major dissapoitment .. I am now stuck with a phone which does not work and have spent almost 10k on it..!!

  This phone is another value for money product from the house of Samsung. The following are the things why I like and dislike about  the product:-Pros:1.Battery Life- with 4000mah battery the the battery is powerful for day long intensive use.2. Display-with 5.7 infinity display, the screen the best you can get at this price range.3.Processor- with snapdragon octa core processor the phone is perfect for multi window functions and moderate gaming.4.Android: comes with the latest version of Android 10.5.Memory - comes with 3 gb ram and and 32 gb internal memory with sd card support upto 512 gb which is really good.6. The dark comes looks really cool to me.7. Shape is really nice as it sticks to your palm giving you comfort and I-phone kind of a feeling.Cons:Camera- I must say Samsung fails in a certain way when it comes to camera .Chinese brands are way ahead in this criteria. This is the only thing where Samsung misses out.Overall I give a double thumbs up to this device apart from camera.This is THE PRODUCT product to buy in this  price range if you want to avoid non-chinese product.Also not forget the good after sales service you get from Samsung,they have service centres all over India.

  Galaxy M01 comes with pre installed Android 10, which means the user shall have state of the art privacy and security features. Additionally, Samsung's One UI Core 2.0 provides simple user interface which is seamless and attractive.I have been using this phone from last 10 days and faced no issues. All the features are reliable and easy to use.Talking about battery, since I do not use social media and gaming, battery for me lasts for about 2 days after one full charge.You can also hide the navigation keys from the screen and still navigation will be seamless.Another best feature is that you can disable the pre installed Google apps on this phone if you are too concerned about Google collecting your personal data.I haven't used the camera much, so I cannot give review for the camera, but bear in mind that it comes with depth effect.Just one improvement the manufacturers could have maintained is not placing the speakers on the rear panel. The sound doesn't plays clearly when phone is placed on soft surfaces like bed. Some users might not like it.Overall, I find this phone excellent for myself. So, I give it 5 stars.

  I bought this phone for just one reason that it is a non chinese brand. Lets talk about some pros and cons of this M01  smartphone.Pros :BEST THING WITH THIS PHONE IS THAT IT IS HANDY. IT FITS IN YOUR HAND SO WELL. ALSO ITS SCREEN SIZE IS SMALLER THAN THOSE BIG SMARTPHONES.TILL NOW THERE IS NO LAG ISSUE.VERY LESS HEATING ISSUE.CAMERA IS BIT REALISTIC.MULTI TASKING IS SMOOTH.DISPLAY IS SUPER IN THIS PRICE RANGE.PLACEMENT OF POWER BUTTONS AND VOLUME KEYS  ARE SOMETHING IMPRESSIVE.ANDROID 10CONS :AGAIN SCREEN SIZE. AS NOWADAYS EVEN 5K SMARTPHONES HAVE  6+"" SCREEN.CHARGING IS A BIG ISSUE AS IT COMES WITH A 10V CHARGER. IT TAKES AROUND 3:30hrs FOR FULL CHARGE.BATTERY SIZE IS ALSO A ISSUE AS IT COMES WITH A 4000mah BATTERYMEDIA VOLUME COULD HAVE BEEN MORE LOUDER.AND MOST IMPORTANT IT COMES WITH SOME BANNED PRE INSTALLED APPS. IDK WHY THESE PEOPLE GIVE THESE THINGS IN A NEW PHONES.

"
"

  I got this at 8k and my mom likes it.Pros:I think it is best budget phone right now.No heat issues.No lag.Very good quality of screen even better than lcd screen.Camera at this price is decent it comes with all filters and beauty modes.Cons:Little bit Thick.Charger is only 5 watt.

"

  Phone is good at this price range with Samsung branding.Good thingBattery life very good with calling and data usageDisplay is bright enough in outdoor no issue with auto brightnessSound is clear for speakers as well as earpiece.Camera quality is ok for this price range. Rear camera is good and front camera is ok.Bad thingFace unlock not so fast compare to other brandsCharging take more than 2 hrs for full chargeShould provide at plastic caseRest phone is good for normal usage with faily activity of whatsapp and call and surfing internet no lag and any issues.

  Samsung is just not able to deliver the quality the customer expect from it.There nothing good about this phone,Its slow, hangs if you download a few apps, even its not able to support half the capacity other phone of this range/memory/RAM can support.In just 30 days of delivery the phone showed a display problem, and when I visited their service centre, they said it will take at least 4 days to fix the display issue. Which I believe, if done outside wouldn't take more then 10 mins. And as per them you have to leave your phone with them for these 4-5 days when they will be ordering and arranging the display. As if you bought the phone for ur baby to play video games and you dont have any important needs from your smart phone.

"
"

  Got a defective set, where calls keep dropping after few minutes. Doesn't Samsung do a quality check on its products, they sell defective sets. This does not have a fingerprint reader as mentioned. Not going to buy Samsung anymore, shifting to redmi.Reported it to Amazon, had a good customer service experience and they refunded the amount.

"
"

  One of the best smart phone in 9k Rs ...It almost provide all smart features like wifi calling, dual 4g, cast.....Surely better than chainees brand.

  I really very disappointed with the Amazon service center.I have purchased this phone on 27 September 2020 and I received this phone on 30 September 2020 the phone was properly packed and was in working condition but on next day it has requested software update and I updated it then it stopped working. I have contacted customer care they requested replacement for this phone but it was rejected by Amazon pick up agent. The agent said he needs IMEI number to confirm then only he can pickup this phone. I have contacted several times Amazon customer services, they arrange pickup but pickup agent reject it saying I can’t pickup this phone without IMEI number. How can anyone check the IMEI number if the phone is having software issue. It’s been 20 days now I am without phone because I have purchased this in exchange option.

  Samsung M01 is good for the one who is amateur with android smart phone. I have bought this phone in 8k and I feel with the brand name it is worth to buy these features with this much amount.Pros -1. Good battery life - Almost 2 days it worked for me. I have use whatsapp, playstore and had calls.2. Rear camera is good.3. Handy in size - I took this phone as it's display size is 5.7 inch.4. Face unlock feature5. Performance or speed of the phone is not bad.Cons -1. No fingerprint sensor.2. Selfie camera is poor, I expected front camera to be better. Do not take the phone if anyone have to click selfies.3. Samsung should provide a protection glass or cover or earphones.4. Miracast and chrome cast app causes the mobile to restart.

  I am happy to buy samsung m01. This phone is good in look, battery backup is awesome, camera is ok, and biggest thing i don't want to buy a Chinese phone so I will go with samsung.

  HiThis Samsung M01 is such  handy phone build Samsung ever.  The design of the phone Is stunning and there are no chance of slipping from hand .And people like me always looks for the phone which is handy with tons of feature .This display fluidity is awesome and there is no lag in playing games either.People who leads their life simple and subtle will like this phone .To mention few  addon would make this phone better .B1.Box speaker would be better2.Aluminum frame would give this model richer look instead.3. Updated chipset with more memory and with same harwarebuild will make this phone hurricane in entire smartphone market.At last expecting compact phone with tons of feature loaded .Thanks

"
"

  This phone is suitable if one's requirement is of a basic smartphone which is affordable, durable and comes handy.I am satisfied with the phone for the very same purpose that I mentioned above.The UI is quick and smooth, display quality is excellent and battery life is good.The only drawback I found for this category of phone is the camera quality which could have been better, but no qualms about it.Any other high end expectations would be defeated. After all it's a Samsung brand that speaks for itself.

"
"

  1. Overall feel good.2. Lags a bit but not that much that too sometimes, may be it will settle with time3. Fingerprint Scanner should have been included, that's bad not to have.4. While charging they should provide a indicator light on top of screen, every time have to click the button/unlock to check5. Vibration while touching menu/Back buttons at bottom can't be disabled6. Sound and Camera is Good7. Battery charging and daily life not that good but what more to expect in this budget.8. take it if your budget is low. its a good  Phone but dnt expect much

"
"

  This  phone is very convenient to use. 3 GB ram ensures it will not lag.32 g b memory is also sufficient. Photos are good  and  images are sharp and bright.

"
"

  Entry level mobile for basic call, messaging, and internet needs. Nothing fancy. Poor camera quality. Charging takes forever, but battery life lasts quite a while (with usage of call, whatsapp, youtube, no gaming). Loudspeaker is not loud enough.No headphones, backcover, screen guard included, charging cable is very short.Ordered this after getting frustrated with MI flash sale scam. Okayish mobile for around 8k. Would suggest to spend around 2k more and get a better mobile.

"
"

  Despite having 3GB ram it's pretty fast and impressive. Can use multiple apps at the same time. Battery life is superb, easily lasts for a day. Sometimes even more depends on the usage. Not meant for playing high end games though. If you are looking for a smartphone for your routine office work and other stuffs go for it but if for playing games you have to spend a bit more. Charging it takes almost 2 to 2.5 hours which is acceptable considering it's not typeC. If it had type C charger then it could have been a game changer for Samsung.I am really happy with my M01😁😁

"
"

  - Battery drains fast- Gets heated up during charging- doesn’t support 5G wifi (only 2.4 G)- camera is average- it’s ok, but only if you are a light mobile phone user, won’t recommend for current generation heavy/regular users.

"
"

  Hi,I purchased it for my Father.1) Good average phone.2) Better alternative for Chinese mobile even it was lag in some features.3) Battery is working for more than 36 Hrs after moderate usage.4) Butter smooth operations.5) Comes with Android 10. Hope regular updates will be available.6) Camera is decent.7) Sounds are clear8) Display is responsive9) Handy10) Missing fast charging11) Missing Finger print security12) Comes Office tools13) Suggest: Power n Volume button should be in same side ( Now frequent screen shots capturing without knowledge)Overall ""VALUE FOR MONEY"".

"
"

  This is an example of product made in India and made for India. Bought this product for my father. Battery life and performance is really good. Just a bit disappointed with camera quality. Somehow I felt that this product is bit overpriced. Samsung could have packed a headphone or backcover with this product. If you want to gift this phone to your parents or children I would suggest you must buy it. Moreover you can trust the samsung apllications. Hope this review helps :) Happy shopping with Amazon delivery was really fast. The pricing policy was also very strategic.Thank you Amazon. Thank you Samsung.

"
"

  Now don't buy any product from Amazon. They have changed their policy. Now they dont return items. They will only replace weather you are satisfied with the product or not. So now be aware. I am not satisfied with this M 01 phone so i want return but Amazon is not agree for return.

"
"

  First of the phone is has very good look and the price also reasonable from amazon.based on the two week usage the review1.the design was compact easily you can hold the phone in hand as we as packets2.battery life also very good3.important thing is screen resolution was ultimate and speed of the phone was very goodAnd quick response to application s4.sound quality also very good5.network connectivity superAnd drawback isCharging of phone the take time because they provide normal micro usbOtherwise the phone is very nice and go for it for normal users...

"

  Writing this review after more then week of usage, One of the best mobile at this prices. Got it for 4099/- after a exchange of my old mobile for 4400/-.* Battery was strong enough continuously used for entire day  Facebook, WhatsApp, video and calls. Takes two hours to charge 100% but will remain for two days to totally drain out.* Display was awesome and looks great with the stylish edge finish* Camera was great especially front great to take selfies.*Processor performing very well.After a month of  searching  got a great one with the for better price....

"
"

  In this price rangeProsBetter BatteryDisplay goodOne UI and darkmode greatCamera OkFaceunlock works good**Manufactured in IndiaConsTakes lot of time to chargeNo fingerprint readerIf you want a phone for WhatsApp, Calling,Bank payments,Normal office work,Better Battery  backup,decent/good Camera,for Social Media usage,Decent gaming i.e not high end ones like PUBG....can play at low graphics or PUBG lite....then definitely go for it

"
"

  Very high price in our segment Display is very bad quality and very very bulky product I said you go to other product just like real me Nazro Redmi nine prime

"
"

  This phone doesn't work well with Jio Network ( unable to make call and receive call, the call jets ends ), it works with all other networks, i thought its the sim card issue and got a new sim card aswell, but the issue persists,I bought this Phone Twice and i see same issue..Apart from Network failure with Jio, rest of the Product Functionality are Good at this price point

"
"

  Samsung is known for their eccentric and long lasting product.  This phone is no exception. Although in a sub 10k segment, samsung doesn't offer much, compared to it's market rivals. But surely this phone can be a good example of balance between budget and components.It definitely has good battery life, although it's quite new.  user interface is quite simple and easyto use. really low spec phone, meant for casual use. Camera however is bit overwhelming, has a absurd auto HDR mode, which results in very bad portraits.overall, it's  good phone for everyday casual use'

"
"

  Received faulty mobile. Mobile takes 8 hours to fully charge. Can someone advise what to do?I don't know what to do. Expect Amazon to help with this.

"
"

  This phone i bought it for my dad. Initially I was satisfied with this Samsung phone at this price level. In this Corona times, my dad went 5 times to Airtel showroom.  Changed Airtel Chennai SIM 3 times but Call drop issues did not get resolved.  Left with no other option, I bought Chinese phone with exchange option of 20 days used this Samsung Phone. I am disappointed with loss of money due to resale.We live near Chennai Airport (within proper city limits).Not recommend bcoz of Call drop issues.

"
"

  8k is too much amount to pay for this phone... Just bought as there are no option for non Chinese phone and Samsung is using this opportunity by adding premium to every phones or tablets..if you take selfies from this phone you will hate yourself .I have to struggle with swap function everytime to receive calls...

"
"

  In the world of smartphones, where all brands have started manufacturing mobile sizes from 6.5 inches to 7 inches which are like tablets, M01 is fresh breath. Just when I needed a much needed spare mobile which is non Chinese, with basic features and average RAM, ROM, good battery, M01 solved my purpose. Perfectly sized for my hand and pocket, 3GB,32GB is absolutely matching my expectations.Being a basic handset, I don't expect good camera and fingerprint is not thereAmazon delivery has been before scheduled time as always.

"
"

  Heavy Weight Thickness, Samsung UI User Interface Sucks Pre loaded (Installed) With Many Samsung App With Other Un Useful Apps, Need Less Price From Current Price 8399 As Per Heavy Weight and Other Brands Comparison Only Good For New User or First Time User.

"
"

  I've purchased two phone and both phone has performance issue. Sometimes unable to pickup the call and also sometimes phone is hanged.I've requested for return of this phone but amazon guy's are saying issue will be resolved after OS update. So I tried to update the OS and also tried factory reset option but is still there.

"
"

  Absolutely impressed by the phone.. that's why I choose Samsung every single time..no mistake by any way in the phone...no lag/hang..camera is also best..screen is just superb..noone gives you such screen in this price point but Samsung has given.. buying totally worth it..Best smartphone by Samsung in this budget.. Don't even look for those Chinese brands..no.1 phone with awesome battery backup and gaming performance is also good.. totally satisfied..user interface is friendly and finger print reader is also amazingly fast as well

"
"

  1. Incoming Calls are disconnected frequently once received.2. Internet not works even though mobile data is on.3. Not able to share the location from google maps.4. Volume/sound quality not good5. Sometimes blue screen comes in lock screen entering pin to unlock6. Display not good7. Camera quality not goodFinally not recommend this product and ready to return this product but unfortunately they given 6 days time to return the product but issues/defects occured after 6 days.

"
"

  This phone is good for performance camera is not so good does not have finger print sensor and ir blaster. Battery life is average good. Overall good phone to have in this  budget and anti China product. I prefer Samsung over any other Chinese brand either they provide much better feature. Design is good and comfortable.

"
"

  Received a dead unit and opted for replacement but more than 15 days have passed and the device still haven't been taken back every time when Customer care is contacted they say that the device will be picked up in next 24hrs but after talking to them for more than 10 times its like they themselves have no clue that what is going on they keep on saying that this time it will be picked up but its been 15 days and no replacement device is received or the dead unit has been taken back

"
"

  Network is getting disconnected frequently....

"
"

  Video calls made using this device Galaxy M01, 3GB where recepient are not able to hear my voice clearly unless I keep the phone close to my mouth as we do on a regular call. In short cant use for video calls, nor useful to record video with dialog which are not louder when played on full volume.Microphone looks faulty,  requested Amazon to return n replacement but taking  time, a week already lost.My first experience with Samsung phone is landed me in a doldrums.I hope I don't have to live with this defective device.

"
"

  I bought this mobile after seeing reviews of every mobile in this budget i could possibly  find and this was best in the segment1  it has best battery life which easily last  1.5-2 days2  camera is good . Face unlock works nicely3 display colours and size of screen is perfect4 handles every task smoothly5 ram management is good6 feels good in hand and nice build quality(plastic is not of cheap quality)7 Samsung's one ui is the best and user friendly

"
"

  I was shocked that there is. I finger print sensor available in this phone. Along with that the speakers (ear ,outer) are not audible enough even in a calm environment. When the basic features of a smart phone are lacking in this phone, does is makes sense to buy this phone?No.If there is a no return policy exists on the amazon purchase, I bet the no becomes a big NO.

"
"

  No fingerprint reader, battery life  is satisfactory, once charged  it goes for about 1 to 1.5 days depending on use. User friendly interface but if you're using Samsung for the first time it will take sometime to get used to it as compared to Xiomi and Huawei phones.Also, few android features are missing like it doesn't show network speed, doesn't have additional volume button for only alarm setting and no separate tab for headphone advance settings. Other features , sound and camera is great. Handy and smooth running.

"
"

  We have purchaged this phone on 18 th Aug. and It is too early to share expert comments but can share our feeling towards phone, it looks very compact n user friendly as compared to my other phones. Battery life also very good. Very good looking a handy for normal users, never found any laging or any difficulties during usage. Lots of good and very useful features found in all segments of the phone. It provides you fresh n wow  feeling while  usage. Overall we can say more than worth to buy this phone in this price tag.

"
"

  The M01 phone has very bad call volumeOn full volume in settings still can’t hear the persons voice .. it’s v faintIs anyone else facing the Same issue ??

"
"

  Nice phone under 10k. I wanted to gift my father a non- chinese phone under rs. 10k budget and Non- other than Samsung could provide such facility. This phone is value for money and performing very good.

"
"

  This is a super  phoneAtthis price range.Small screen size so very comfortable and easy to handleBut also very powerful processor and has nice speed with a 3gb ramBest for users looking small, comfortable and powerfull and also best for everyday use.. :)Have a awesome battery backupAnd high security with a nice and speedful  face lock(fingerprint is not provided)Camera quality is okAlso has value for money.. !:)

"
"

  Camera quality is really good for price paid. Also battery life is decent and lasts for around 2/3ed of a day on continuous  hotspot as I use laptop for work and use this phone as my hotspot device.

"
"

  No fingerprintBattery  charging takes around 4 to 6 hours. Size is handy small.Have many features like smart sim which is both sim transfer call between eachother when busy.Internet while call etcGopd phone, dont buy if you're addicted to use fingerprint, faceunlock is not even 50% comfort as fingerprint

"
"

  Actually I bought it for my mother as a gift. Sound quality, camera and rest is oke but screen width is less, very small in size in fact...go for a unboxing youtube video then purchase it...I wanted to replace it for small size,but couldn't for Amazon's policy change!!! So be careful about size before order.

"
"

  A basic phone by samsung. Camera quality is not good specially at night. I bought this phone for my father. So it's ok for him.

"
"

  It's a horrible phone. Moreover to resolve the issue when spoken to Amazon representative he was horribly dum and he not even listened the problem to resolve. He simply denied to help to resolve. Even before replacing he advised to install app to check whether I m lying.Representative of Amazon was so noncoperative and insensitive. I decided not to purchase anything on this cheat app. Horrible experience on Amazon. If this can happen to a well educated person then what about a layman.

"
"

  Very very poor phone, not even one month and the screen is already damaged. Samsung is very disappointing and their services are equally bad. It's so sad to go through this, especially in 2020 when the world is making such tremendous explorations outside of planet earth. Here we are , still dealing with cheap phones. Stealing people's money on brand value and tricking people to pay more money by selling super super super cheap productsThis is the worst phone, EVER.

"
"

  Nice product if you are taking it as a secondary phone or upgrading from a keypad phone. Best for aged people.It will be more better if they provide a finger print sensor with it. It has 1amp charger i think they should give atleast 2amp charger as its battery is of 4000mAh which takes a lot of time near about 4 hrs to full charge from 1 amp charger

"
"

  Fast with 3gb ram and long battery life. Full battery lasted 4 days for a regular user like me without gaming. Camera is totally disappointing. Overall a good low budget range non Chinese phone.

"
"

  Fingerprint unlocking feature missing in today's era is a crime, I bought this phone assuming it a basic feature now a days, and since I was not interested in looks I ignored the back side (I was anyways going to use a back cover, which I already ordered along)..... But seriously... This only one thing will make this model fail... I would like to return it if the seller can take it back and exchange for a similar configure phone with a finger touch back, please

"
"

  The phone is good , as expectede . Some features however would make it a top notch .The phone does not come with a back cover , which is essential . It may add less thanrs 100 to the cost .Also some features in weather and daily panchang etc has scope of improving

"
"

  Over all the look of the mobile is so simple, it doesn't seema catchy at all. Display experience is also not as good as you find in it's previous mid range mobiles like on5 and on7 pro. You also didn't find this much good for extremely good picture. But they quite satisfactory. So here I guess you are only paying for battery, storage, prosessor sort of dual camera features and infinity display and most importantly the SAMSUNG brand.

"
"

  This mobile phone Samsung galaxy m01 is really very good and value for money , this does not have a fingerprint reader, but has a face recognition function , overall the phone is very good .

"
"

  Nice product! Galaxy M01 comes with pre installed Android 10, which means the user shall have state of the art privacy and security features. Additionally, Samsung's One UI Core 2.0 provides simple user interface which is seamless and attractive. I have been using this phone from last 10 days and faced no issues.Fingerprint reader is wonderful in this device.Battery life is too great.Camera quality is awesome.

"
"

  This phone is great. Good value for money and also it can be used roughly. The phone is very responsive and easy to use. But the face id is not that good. It doesn't recognize the face sometimes. But for the price, it's worth it. Also the back camera is quite clear. One more point to add, there is no sensor next to front camera. The sensor by which we can hear the whatsapp audio when we bring the phone to our ear. Overall, great phons for the price.

"
"

  Quality products

"
"

  This is best phone in this price the battery life very nice, and camera quality is also better than other company's phones with this price.I purchased this mobile for online studying in this pendamic situation there is boom to the online study and all company's has incresed the prices of mobile .ACCORDING to me it is a best mobile in this price no other mobile can compeet at this price and in procedure and other features.

"
"

  Phone lags and keyboard stops responding Many times .  Expected a lot better product from Samsung.

"
"

  Camera 3.5/5Battery 3.25/5Touch excellentDisplay 4/5Overall performance is Better within its price. But not best.It is not made for gaming.Is better for multitasking.I was hoping more from this phone but it's satisfactory and most of all I purchased because not a Chinese company.Jai Hind.

"
"

  I purchased this mobile for my mom.Good brand mobile in this price range.Sound & Sound quality is very poor I give 1 star.Mobile Size is compactNo Fingerprint scanner is a big disadvantage as facial recognition dont work properly.

"
"

  Camera quality is very poor...... don’t buy this phone worthless

"
"

  It is an Ok phone for normal users.Although not sure why Samsung skipped the fingerprint reader.They could have very well provided it at this price point, I believe.

"
"

  Worst experience with this phone..bought this phone a week back from amazon for my mom, in first week itself..facing network reception issues and heating issues.On top of that no proper support provided by Amazon, a tech visit was arranged at my place and the technicial reset and rebooted the phone stating that the issue has been resolved but still facing same issue, please do not buy this phone, not atleast from amazon.

"
"

  Good phone in the price range of less than 10000. Handy phone with super stylish look and the blue color one is more attractive. Good phone for a minimal usage person who use phone for calls messages whatsapp google and camera. Not suitable for big games like pubg etc. Better like is also quite good if you stop many unnecessary apps from running in the background. Moreover its not a chinese company phone.

"
"

  Some drawbacks on this phone - 1. Poor hardware causing more radiation. I already have burning sensation and numbness on my fingers and palm. 2. The phone is a heavy weight one, compared to other phones of the same segment. Thickness of the phone is just too much! 3. Display is narrow ( it may be preferred by people who like a little smaller phone). 4. Touch screen doesn't have a standard response effect, not that smooth.

"
"

  Although camera is not so good and pixels are bursting in jooming, phone is at satisfactory level. Rest of the functions are good according to the price range.  Camera quality is less than the usually. If samsung repair this loophole then I think this would be the first choice of the customer under this rangeThere is no fingerprint sensor then please suggest how can I rate you for this? 🤩

"
"

  Very bad camera.13+2 MP but look like a 4 MP rear camera,Very disappointed 😁😁.

"
"

  No regrets buying Samsung galaxy m01.Best thing I got best exchange value.Don't hesitate to buy.

"
"

  It's a very good phone at this price. Very smooth  touch, very good quality of disply, nice speaker  sound and battery  backup for whole day in normal use. Camera is also good if u compare camera of other phone having same specifications.Must buy phone at this price.

"
"

  The camera quality is just amazing.I trust only samsung for camera quality and this product makes me trust the brand even more.The sound quality is also good.Battery life is just amazing.Charge it once and it will last for more than 12 hours or maybe even more. Love it.

"
"

  Samsung Galaxy M01 is a good choice for a budget under rs.10,000. Now the price is also decreased so it's a good value for money if you are looking for a non Chinese smartphone

"
"

  Overall review is good. Though there is no such figure print sensor, but the other function is good as well. It has an additional function of blue light filter which may helps those who prefers to use it for long time.

"
"

  Worst phone ever. Don’t go for it because of the low price range. Display screen is so bad, while scrolling it considers it as touch. Camera quality is really bad. Does not have fingerprint censor. Face unLock almost doesn’t work because of the bad camera quality. It is facing problem with getting good network. Sound quality is poor. Overall very bad quality phone. Please don’t go for it.

"
"

  Nice made in india product1. Screen is good2. Camera quality in nice wide angle is main highlight3. Battery performance is good company should have peovided 10volt charger with it.4.face unlock works good5.very handy and sleek designOverall it gives a good value for money

"
"

  SIM tray didn't come out on very first time. Called customer care for help and finally return it.Happy with Amazon response and dealing, except return time.Samsung need to look into quality of there product.Still like this phone and ordered new one,Look and size is very nice, can easily operate with one hand, wish higher model should also come in same size.

"
"

  The phone size is really small which makes it almost inoperable especially the breadth of the mobileSecondly the ringtone volume is also very lowThirdly the refund policy of this phone only includes replacement and not even refund.Highly disappointed with the product as well as the return/refund.And I strongly suggest to go for other products in the similar range but not this one.

"
"

  I bought this phone because of it size but that was my biggest mistake because it takes around 4hrs to charge and that's why I have given request to return.In today's era of technology no one has that amount of time to charge the phone and after that it can't even last for a day. I have added a pic in that you can clearly see and if you start from zero you can see time around 4hrs.Thank You.

"
"

  First of all your replace and refund service disappoint me. You should not show while buying the mobile if you don't replace it after purchase.Camera is worst, battery is good but overall pricing is too high as offering the configurations.

"
"

  Product was good but slight defective send back and got refund immediately very fast response by Amazon

"
"

  I strongly believe that this product is the best at this price that I have ever seen before. A profound series released by samsung for lower budget people. Thank you samsung for this incredible item. Overall performance is great, mainly processor and battery. Btw, I am loving this face unlock feature. It just unlocks mobile within a second. Once again, thank you for this masterpiece. Worthy purchase!

"
"

  having used for over a week, sleek designgood interface and performanceaverage cameraFair battery life.only issue is that the camera hangs when you open the app after a long time. need to close it and reopen again

"
"

  Cons1. Too many samsung ads and services2. Samsung service notification cannot be disabled3. mid range camera4. face recongnition cannot telypros1. good spec at this budget2. trusted brand3. call quality and recording good

"
"

  It's camera is not satisfied . And screen size is little smaller than other smartphone... Overall good but not the best according to its price. Other brands will give maximum features than that samsung galaxy M01.Biggest Disadvantage is that it takes too much time for complete charging but battery performance is good. And other issue is it's camera quality is blurry .

"
"

  Its a good phone for this price from samsung..... i bought this phone via amazon....after using this for 2 weeks i am writing this review that phone is good working and have a good battery power.... camera quality are also not bad.... good display with a nice processing speed...  only a few second needed to unlock using face...  so fast unlocking.... and overall its a good choice  for parents.....

"
"

  This phone doesn't have screen cast. Is it that difficult to have this small feature included. I tried external apps including samsung smart things as my TV is also Samsung but didn't work.So iam disappointed

"
"

  Worst phone I’ve ever seen from SamsungIt has so much of screen issue, and the same can be seen while clicking pictures , making the phone ridiculousWhile turning ON the dark mode every colour shows a white shadow which is obviously irritating and annoyingPhone also lags in recording the calls by 1 or 2 secondsBattery is good since it was a new phone lol

"
"

  Phone super but not fast charging mode

"
"

  M01 - an economic phone, looks good, battery life very good, user interface good, performance very good, camera not bad. Overall good value for the money spent if you are having normal use!

"
"

  I got this phone with no sound clarity and no picture quality as delivery boy throwed from very long distance at door , I want to return this product and it's not working, complaint raised since I got this phone no one is taking action from amazon and returned allowed me on 5th sep , I did it but not taking return

"
"

  Don’t believe everything on reviews. Phone is good for those who don’t want 6inch and heavy weight phone.

"
"

  The mobile  was very handy and too fast performance, display is too vibrant  but optimum size for usage....totally  mobile was awesome with this price....Samsung  brand  quality  is good, snapdragon  process did best , samsung ui looks very disent

"
"

  Performance of the mobile phone is very bad,Amazon technician respoce is Very bad

"
"

  Good cute and handy phone value for money. Fingerprint reader function not included. Charging time seams to be little bit long.

"
"

  Best phone in this range, Smartphone with latest Android updates. Ordered for my Father who had not used any touchscreen before. Became comfortable in merely 4 days . Backup is really good. All app can be installed.  Main thing Made In India. Really happy with choice. And in current Covid scene amazon really delivered geniun and safe way. Thanks Amazon and Samsung.

"
"

  I bought this phone on 8 th August.  It phone is awesome. Its camera is not too good but also not too bad . It size is too good . It very easy come in pocket . So , it simple to carry . It had light body .It had value for money . So , I am big fan of samsung mobile because it give us value for money . Samsung m series is know for battery it clearly prove by this m01 phone .

"
"

  Got this mobile for my parents..very good for low to medium usage people..didnt want to go for Chinese brand mobilesDisplay is the best as it is SamsungBattery charge holds good for 2 days with normal usageFinger print scanner not availableCamera quality is goodOverall very good phone!! Highly recommended made in India product..

"
"

  Good phone under Rs.9000/- budget. Received on 21.08.2020 on exchange of my J7 nxt. Apps run smoothly. Very handy with 5.7 inch screen as the borders are very close to screen. Camera is good as per price. Battery is decent as 50% power remains till night with moderate use(calls & games, browsing). It has Qualcomm processors hence heating is very less likely.No finger reader.

"
"

  3gb and 32gb is worth for money for Samsung brand though u get cheaper in other brandHowever I am totally disappointed with Samsung M01 on the bluelight feature as it is not at all effective and harm our eyes and I am thinking to return this product as I don't want to compromise with eyes whatever brand and configuration.Hope Samsung here my concerns and help

"
"

  This mobile is one that can be rated as average but at this price range, it's a good buy. Additionally, it comes with the assurance of the Samsung brand.

"
"

  Awesome Amazon service..i bought in amazon prime within 24 hours I got delivery my mobile.its superb fast service and brand new Samsung M01 . Superb display and camera 👌 battery charger.. overall mobile 4.3/5Packing of amazon is wonderful.

"
"

  Amazon have given description that mobile contains fingerprint scanner but we was shocked that the phone was without fingerprint scanner.Other Companies provide fingerprint scanner in similar segments.Not satisfied with this phone at a price of Rs.8400Faceunlock of this phone is of very poor quality.

"
"

  The best thing about this phone is that it's very handy and light. The size fits smartly in your hand.Nice looks. Performance also is good enough. For this price.2 things that I did not like is:1. Camera. Not a good one.2. Takes time to charge. (Because of its charger)

  The processor works well andcthe camera is handy atvthe given price. Thecsleek finish looks similar to other prime phones available in the market. Overall it's a good one to carry at this price of 9k

"
"

  Average mobile with poor camera.Battery life is decent.Offering less features compared to market.Go for other good deals, not recommended.

"
"

  The only negative point of M01 is not having a fingerprint reader,besides that the camera quality is not bad at all,the ""battery life"" is also quite good.in this price range the Samsung  M01 is truely a quite good smart phone.So go for it without hesitation.

"
"

  Awesome mobile at this price range.Recommended for light users

"
"

  Good non Chinese option at this price. Camera is very poor both front and back. Yes, battery takes 3-4 hrs to get fully charged from zero. Presence of notification light and fingerprint sensor would have make this phone a very good option. But overall good option for the people who don't want to play around with this phone.

"
"

  worst mobile phone in this price, very very badly hanging issue in this mobile, also touch is not smooth, camera quality is very very bad

"
"

  This phone doesn't have a fingerprint sensor. The battery is very good - with a normal use, after full day the  battery still shows 80% remaining.Speaker volume is not good should have been a little louder. That is why 3 stars. Otherwise would have given 5 stars to this phone at this price.

"
"

  This product is not good, feature are very less, and amazon not provide return or reffund policy, they are not considered the customers satisfaction.They are looking for business only,forcelly added mobiles to customers

"
"

  Samsung m01 is handy and easy to use with one. I gifted this to my mother. The camera quality is good for this price. For a normal user i thing this phone is ok.Cons:Face id is slight lag in low lightFingerprint sensor is absentBut i like the product for this budgetI think this review can help others.

"
"

  I was planning to buy any phone available in lowest possible range with basic features. This model was already bestseller and it costed even less than my target budget. Functions great, I charge it after more than a day.It doesn't have fingerprint lock, call recording option and its own music player. Rest everything is very convenient and handy.

"
"

  Avoid Chinese products such as REDMI, REALME as they are very dangerous for our PRIVACYOutstanding battery lifeCamera quality of rear and front- Very goodScreen quality is good.RAM management is excellentPrince is excellent at this priceQualcomm Snapdragon 439 processor is good enough for daily uses

"
"

  Great build quality.Surprisingly good camera.Smooth touch.Quality of call reception and clarity of voice over microphone is superb ( many friends have remarked about the crystal clear voice over phone calls)Quality of the loudspeaker is very good.Great phone for regular use.Attaching a photo sample.

"
"

  Pro.slim lookCons. Worst camera

"
"

  Sleek yet robust! was using a Chinese brand earlier and found this one in exchange. best is the battery life, I am using since last month and a half now but one charge and it's enough for me for a full busy WFH day.  Camera and other performance are of the right choices for me. Overall a good deal under 7k for me.

"
"

  Its too early to give the review.Finger print feature is not given :(However overall product seems good for now but we noticed that call was getting disconnected every 2 mins but however this problem seems to be solved after software update. Other features are looking good and functional.

"
"

  Not worth. Touch Is horrible. Camera god got nothing. Display horrible. Very slow. Don’t buy. I purchased because I didn’t wanted to buy China made. Nationalism came in my way rise in this price could have got nice phone

"
"

  Configuration on paper is good but camara performance remainded me the Old VGA camera. Very poor picture quality. bit disappointed today.....A suggestion to samsung guys if you people overlook the present scenario , you will miss it forever..... I just purchased it because I don't want to go for other brands for some specific reason...

"
"

  Great for its price. Simple yet elegant design.Pros include:-Great battery lifeBuilt in Blue Light Filter (to protect your eyes)Dolby Atmos (enhanced sound performance)Attractive pricingLow SAR valueConfidence of SamsungMinimal BloatwareValue for moneyGo for it!

"
"

  Great features in this price...Samsung rocks really..... full value for moneyAdd a 32 gb memory card and enjoy...

"
"

  Good purchase. Loudspeaker volume is a bit on the lower side. Quality and usability is good, and as expected from Samsung.Camera is good but not outstanding. As expected.

"
"

  It is a very nice  Mobile in mid-segment, The build quality is good,  Impressive screen resolution &  decent battery back up.  In this budget,  It is difficult to get better mobile as compare to this.  I have red color variant  which is really very good color. A brand company mobile by Samsung. Go for it.

"
"

  Let's all about it clearlyCamera-2.7/5 low light very bad,day light okPerformance- 3/5 not for pubgBattery- 4/5 for moderate usage,heavy usage3.5/5like continuously 5 hours we can see youtube,moviesOverall 4/5It was good for me for my light usage.I don't use cameras and i do not play games

"
"

  This is pathetic mobile if you think, it has good performance rating in case of battery life. I will give 0 out of 10. Battery never charges easily.Battery is the soul of mobile, if it's drains out or not charges fast.. it worst to buy...Not recommendedThanksAbhijeet

"
"

  Value for money. Very nice phone at this price. Decent display and works well for my office (wfh) usage too.

"
"

  Not happy with the phone.  since it has no fast charging... takes 4 hours for charging fully. Does not have type C cable..

"
"

  Okay so finally we got some good midrange phones from samsung. Just loved it good specs in this price

"
"

  I have purchased Samsung Galaxy M01 and this mobile is simply Awesome and worthy.  The battery performance is good and for me it's one and half day, coming to camera there are many options to take a beautiful picture, in this price this dual camera is fine.  Ultimately, I am satisfied with Samsung.

"
"

   Total waste of money. It's not even been a month since I bought this device and it is almost non functional. Hangs so much that I cant even unlock it. Been facing this issue since a week now. Have restarted and factory reset still the issue.

"
"

  No finger print reader, good product for ealder people, College students with all basic features included - good camera, touch - can easily fit in pockets and purses- definitely recommend to buy

"
"

  Good battery, display and responsiveness is good. Camera is avg as in a samsung. Mi has better camera, but bought this for samsung brand. Good for this price range

"
"

  Phone is ok but having some problems like caller could not hear my voice and sometimes display related problems.Although they have provided replacement but they would not replace instead they would suggest some app checkups that would say your phone is alright.

"
"

  Check after you get the ptoduct. I ordered this phone a got a defective one, it's sim card was not ejecting. I ordered to return they took 7 days to complete that process. But got my money back very soon. The phone is good compared to  chineese toy phones. Has a good built up quality and good for aged people.

"
"

  I received a defected phone, I informed to customers service they provide a technical support person he visited me and comforted this is a defected piece but Amazon customer service not provide replace the mobile. This all long process to replace the defected mobile it's takes more than 10 days.

"
"

  Have had several smartphones in the last decade. Build quality of this one seems to be the lowest. Phone was in my pocket and no idea when and what instance it cracked but i see the screen is now cracked. I purchased this phone barely one month back. Really disappointed.

"
"

  Very Poor Product ... It's very Disappointing us..I Purchase this for My Grandfather for they easily work and Battary running whole day.. But this Pjone Battry is very Rediculous and Work mode is not much good

"
"

  Always been a samsung fan so I was sure while choosing this phone. User interface is very good. In day light it captures very good pictures.  Battery life is quite good. Easily go for 1 day in one charge and if internet is not used than almost 1 and half day. Just wish speaker was a bit louder.

"
"

  Poor main / rear camera.Quality of the picture and colours are not at all impressive which is totally contrary to the brand. Not useful for photos. I recommend the phone only for voice calls. Coz Sound is good. Finger print reader and battery life is satisfactory.

"
"

  Camera quality poor. Even Nokia 2mp is good than this. Network signal poor.my jio sim getting full network in other mobile but here it shows 2or maximum 3 network bar.only battery good.

"
"

  Speaker stopped working in one day.Bad customer service from amazon representative when asked about can 1 day exception as the phone was for old person and she took time to understand the amazon representative talked in very rude tone indirectly telling that amazon is  doing a favor on us but not customer service

"
"

  1st we received damaged phone, which we returned [after lot of effort] 2nd phone was also not working , amazon assigned engineer who came and fix the issue but the product is not worth spending money.Honestly we wanted to return but it can only be replaced and not returned.

"
"

  DO NOT BUY this mobile because once you get the delivery you won't be able to return it. I'm facing overheating issues and when I tried to replace it, an Amazon tech support called me and performed some test and then said it's a normal temperature. On other hand my phone was heating and I had barely 2-3 app installed.

"
"

  This mobile phone speaker are not working and when i am submitting to return this mobile they are saying to first download some app and verify that your phone is defective and after that we will see. i just want that product exchange then why i have to test that defective piece? I am very disappoint with this product.

"
"

  M reviewing after a month of use, with 3 GB ram phone performs very smooth, its filled up with m kid's apps and games. Battery backup is good... bt takes too much time charge..can't complain abt camera its prity ok for phone in this price... just missing fingerprint reader.. on the whole phone is worth on this price..

"
"

  Overall its good, for whom the smartphone is required for only social media...fb, wtsup, youtube, and some daily usage..The calling sound of the phone is very very low, u can't hear the other person in speker even, internet connection gets cut while talking in normal call, its too old system they have given...

"
"

  Good phone for elderly people for basic smartphone use with samsung Branding, but if you want the best value for money phone in this budget then there are better options available in the market.

"
"

  Mobile Hotspot not working properly....It showing connected but internet is not working. Every 10-15 minutes it's getting auto disconnect and take time to reconnect 2-3 minutes approx.  How to manage work if this type of issue occur every 10-15 minutes. Samsung please look in this and resolve it ASAP.

"
"

  Awesome phone in low price range, look,size,performance all superb.Above all its Samsung no worry customer service brand.only negative point is it's not having fast battery charging and C port.

"
"

  Very good phone for People who need phone for calling and for using regular application....Thank you Amazon.

"
"

  Its a nice phone with great 2 days of battery life average camera , nice build quility ,slightly heavy in weight but justified as its has good battery capacity overall nice budget phone from samsung

"
"

  Good phone in this price range. If you have problems with buying a costly phone, just go for it. Please don't blindly believe in all the reviews which say battery isn't good and camera isn't good. They are decent enough. And it is also smoother than my other phone having 4GB RAM. Just GO FOR IT!

"
"

  Samsung M01 seems to be good in performance, battery, camera if you consider Samsung as a Brand and its price. if Non Chinese phone is what you are looking for at this price range,  Samsung M01 is obvious choice

"
"

  Length  and breadth ratio is not at all good. This is having very serious defact if you are making audio call through WhatsApp then the screen should be always on otherwise you can't hear voice.  Now on Amazon no return policy for many things only replacement

"
"

  I brought this phone 30 days ago. I could not hear sound of incoming calls and battery is very poor. It takes 2 hours to charge 20%.This phone is of very poor quality, if possible I'm looking for return. So sad to get such poor product form amazon

"
"

  Not good.. better buy m11 or m21

"
"

  Very good at this price. Worth the money.No earphones, no fingerprint sensor. Bought this as a gift to my mom. Its perfect for her.

"
"

  it was a good device but sometimes face unlock doesn't respond. only one face can be registered at a time for face unlock. its a disadvantage. performance wise it was good for day to day usage.

"
"

  I think you should not buy this phone because you can get a good one by spending 1500-2000 rupees, not a good display , not a fingerprint reader,unable to take long screenshots, despite this all it's a budget and good battery life.I'm unable to return it because of sellers TnC,i want to buy another one .

"
"

  I purchase this mobile for my friendsParents (senior citizens)For whatsapp video calling with their sonAbroad..It's done best..Thank youAmazon and SamsungDelivery too early even in this lockdown period..

"
"

  This is brilliant phone at this price range. Awesome Battery life, Awesome display. Performance average.Camera is average. Over all good phone main thing is this is Samsung not Chinese phone.I hate Chinese phones.

"
"

  I am very satisfied with the product because, I use the product for basic requirements. It is very handy, and smart. The battery is also very good for me i.e. as expected. There is no fingerprint options in this product. Camera is also nice for the daily use. I think it is one of the best budget phones.

"
"

  The phone is extremely well . At this price point the best phone

"
"

  No finger print reader (product is manufactured in that way )Can be used by the people who don't play games and use much appsCamera quality is not at all goodGood point is its handy

"
"

  Comparing with the other Chinese brand’s phones available in the same price range, this stands better.The phone is good for average daily usage & not for highly media consumption users.

"
"

  The mobile box seal was tampered, could see some sort of underlying sticker or tape outlining at the first stance. When opening could see the seal was already CUT open and was re-sealed!!!!Ordered Replacement.!Will update the thread once received Replacement.

"
"

  This phone is not being charged or is not charging from the data cable since I purchased what is this? The phone battery is not being charged what is this? Please replace it immediately otherwise I will file a case

"
"

  M01 IS A GOOD BUDGET PHONE. Camera is average. Battery will last 1 day with normal usage. compact design and light weight. charging is slow. good for students for online classes

"
"

  Samsung did it again. Galaxy M01 is a mid segment and budget friendly phone for a brand lovers and first time smartphone users. This is non chinese phone and branded and  atleast buyers can have a good piece of mind.

"
"

  Awesome budget smartphone with wide range of features. I bought it for my Mother and she loved  M01 very much.The display is amazing with color contrast. Battery life is very good and long lasting. Multiple applications are supported by the robust processor. Overall a must buy smartphone.

"
"

  Have been using it for the last few weeks, so far its quite a good purchase! Great phone for the price point, however, would have been better with a larger screen size. Since I am avoiding Chinese companies, this was my final choice. It would become a default choice if a larger screen was provided.

"
"

  I used to Have So Much Trust On Samsung Brand..But I Lost It Completely.. phone Glass Was Broken after 10 Day's of Usage.. It Was, I Gifted To my Father .. Really Heart Broken..

"
"

  I was looking for a good phone to gift my father and the same i found. Its an amazing phone at this price and too good looking.Good battry life with good camera.Totally worthy.

"
"

  It's great. Camera wasn't that good but have to acknowledge the battery life also processing is cool,better than the Chinese smartphone available at low prices tottaly worth it.I will recommend Samsung to my felllo mates definitely cause quality matters.

"
"

  Even though the phone comes with LCD Display , the quality of the display is very goodGiving good Battery Backup, Nice to hold and very smooth  in operation. The only thing I was disappointed  about this phone is not having TYPE C charging, But this is OK for this price range.

"
"

  Very nice finish. Sharp camera with nice viewing but low working with bsnl network for 3G network. And also not showing 4g/ 5g. This moble is only LTE/3G/2G(auto connect) but also slow in Vedio veiwing

"
"

  In the price range good product with available features.

"
"

  Iam Samsung fanI have 6 Samsung phones in my houseBest budget mobile phone, specially during such pandemicUsing from last 2 week, still not found any issue. Battery last whole day in single charge, camera quality is also awesome.Inshort I love this phone....

"
"

  For daily use and without gaming performance was good and smooth;Pros :Display qualityBatteryDesignSansung Brand( made in india)Cons :Little bit small size of displayFast chargingAverage camera

"
"

  Best phone with this price....Loved it a lot. I was worrying about the battery but it lasts for a day... Middle class can close their eyes and go for it... There is no finger print but battery life and camera quality is at the best... I have reviewed it after a month of usage...Honest review

"
"

  They say that this phone doesn't have a good battery life and not latest fast charging like those of Vivo or XIAMI but it is still great. I have experienced that it gets fully charged within 3hrs which ia good for students like us. The reason to like and buy it is simply that it is Samsung's product.

"
"

  Please don't buy this productSound system is soooooo badWhen we doing a videos sound will not recordNot worth of moneyEven now I don't have return options tooI lost my money by investing  on this mobile😔😔😔😔😔😔

"
"

  Product is good for daily use .a budget phone.good performance.camera is worst.front camera light is too low during videocallsGood for aged people

"
"

  Picture quality is not good. when you open the picture file in computer, the quality is bad.Charging takes more the 1hr to full charge.Signal quality is not up to the mark.

"
"

  Very bad productCamera quality is very low just like as 2 megapixel camera

"
"

  Just don't buy this mobile. After few days it's showing network problem. You can't make calls or recieve them,net is also not working. I took it to service center,they are saying to return the product but return period is over. 4G network is not detecting so you can't use Jio sim in it.

"
"

  The phone is extremely handy and small in size. Fits best in pocket. I feel Samsung should bring out smartphones with same screen size with enhanced memory and features such as AMOLED display and better camera. We are bored of carrying bigger phones. Samsung can really think about this.

"
"

  this mobile is very handy and light weight.carrying is very easy.very useful to middle age person.

"
"

  Fingerprints reader is very fast , Selfie and Photos of this phone is Awesome. Battery Life is too good. VALUE of money by Samasung M01. Very good product.

"
"

  Excellent Display and touch . Build Quality is awesome , far better than all Chines Mobiles ( RealMe & MI ).Good battery life of 1 day , ( normal use , avoiding heavy games )Can't expect every feature within this price .Overall , Samsung is best under 8k .

"
"

  Worth of money. A wonderful product for those who use smartphones for day today work. Picture quality is also good. maximum benefits in minimum price.However definately not for those who use smartphones for gaming.The price and performance of Samsung M01 is Worth of money.

"
"

  I have been a Samsung user throughout. All phones in my family are SAMSUNG  made. This phone is value for money priced at 9k. The best part is the size of the phone. Fits in my hand and is comfortable  to operate with one hand.  Very stylish as well. Has a decent processor.  Loved it.

"
"

  I am buy samsung m01 mobile1. After 3days mobile recharge adaptor not working.2. Delivered 13th sep 2020. Next 30th sep 2020. Battery decharged very fastly.3. Iam disapointed that Device.4. Camera also not good. Pictures are not clear.That's it.Ok

"
"

  The item was defective and instead of replacement, amazon did refund which I wasn’t looking for. I needed a replacement and now I will have to wait for delivery if other piece.

"
"

  Samsung n amazon dropped the price within one month and niether helped with even so much as a voucher. Not to mention samsung's after sales service is not better than micromax

"
"

  The mobile touch not working properly.It's taking around 5 hours to get fully charged.While recieving calls also facing lots of problems.As per Samsung Technical TeamThey asked to change phone immediately as a New Phone shouldn't  hang on its 1st day.

"
"

  The product from Samsung is good but with the same prize you can get better mobile with other brand.Camera quality is not too much good.Main problem with the charger it's taking 2.5 hrs to full charge which is more compare to other brands .I suggest  do not buy this product.

"
"

  Width of the display is lesser than the other mobiles of 5.7 inches due to which it seems small phone. Not happy with size of the display

"
"

  One of the worst camera phones, why would you buy it,becuse it's samsung? My mom's 2 yr old Xiaomi phone have better camera than this phone...highly add 2,3 thousand more and buy a better phone or burn the money you have but don't buy this phone

"
"

  1. Sleek, handy, tactfully pocket-sized2. Has everything packed in one nutshell3. Economic4. Reliable, moreover a golden touch from knox5. The one who doesn't show off but does the job6. Using the Red one.. never looks shabby

"
"

  Small in size, picture quality not good.

"
"

  Satisfactory starting range android phone. Battery is good as per screen size. Camera is good, performance fast due to 3GB ram. Overall happy. Gifted to mother... 😍

"
"

  No Fingerprint sensor is hard to digest, but will probably get used to. Face scan is not instantaneous. Other things are amazing. Loved Dolby Atmos. Samsung isn't including earphones these days that's somehow depressing.

"
"

  I give this to 4 star. In this price this is good phone, if you love samsung. Sound quality is good. Ui is android 10 that is awesome. But camera make you little bit disappointed. And one more thing that is not good in this phone is slow charging. Display is tft.

"
"

  It is good phone at 9000 and camera is also okay..but felt the is bit heavy.. delivery by Amazon was on time.

"
"

  Recently Gifted this phone to my father. It's perfect phone for the people who want a handy phone . he is enjoying while using this phone. Main thing he told is the perfect size.Performance wise the phone is good and got it on good price.

"
"

  It is good except i doubt, whether 4g is working in the phone. It only shows 2g and 3g.

"
"

  Faulty product. Charging is very poor. Taking more than 30 hours for full charge.

"
"

  Very good nice product battery life is awesome and processor is excellent in performance overall cameras selfie is good sound quality is very good and has Dolby Atmos but lack of fingerprint scanner and super amoled panel display size can be bigger and charging speed also

"
"

  I purchased for my dad and its fantastic. Awesome features in this price range. Absolute quality added by Samsung.However not satisfied with STPL and Amazon packing. Directly phone box put in to the Amazon plastic bag !!!

"
"

  Fingerprint sensor is not there but like this product. The critical star for this product is 1.4 but this is due to because it does have fingerprint sensor, takes 3:45 hrs. to complete charge.But if we can't see those things then the phone is very good and 5 stars.

"
"

  The phone dimension is very suited for one hand use. Body is plastic.Battry life is good. A medium user can last rheough the day with a single charge.However there is occasional lag.

"
"

  I bought this phone one week back. I have a problem with the mobile that some app closing automatically or some app opens automatically. Phone itself operates automatically.

"
"

  Didn't expected from a brand like samsung from last 15 year I was using samsung mobile but this time it's really very painful

"
"

  The product was as displayed in the discription. Delivered on time. Good for daily use.But the camera quality is not up to the level. Performance of the phone is great.

"
"

  The mic doesn't work and I guess the seller knew about it. The fellow should be blacklisted on amazon. I got to know about it a lot later since I had got it for my father and he said he had been using the speaker since day 1 to communicate. The return window is closed.

"
"

  Bought it @8400 deal for niece for virtual classes.It serves purpose with decent speed and memory.  Battery lasts for full day.  Nice camera at this price.Good budget phone with necessary features.  Face unlock is there but there is no finger print sensor.

"
"

  So froud work so small size and no return,And Amazon customer care service is also no copretive so dear friends not perches  in Amazon so bad mobile and Amazon customer care

"
"

  It's not worth mobile.requested for return after delivered mobile within 6hours .but no response from amzon and telling stories to take return .very disappointed.

"
"

  M01 does not have finger print scanner and only single camera which have very worst quality of camera. The discription given by amazon is not satisfying.

"
"

  Good

"
"

  The phone feels really good in the hand. Perfect fit. Its fast and has a good battery life, which last about two days. Camera needs improvement but otherwise a good phone for daily use.

"
"

  Very poor product. I want to refund and purchase another one. This handset is even not accepting in any exchange by Amazon or Flipkart

"
"

  nyc phone for simole use camera and speaker is not that much goodbut all over phine is good at this price.

"
"

  Very decent specs at this price point. 1000 times better than brands like vivo, oppo, Mi. 4000 mAh battery and infinity display at this price point is really amazing. Recommend this is to everyone looking at a price point of less than 9K.

"
"

  Nice product must buy if ur looking to buy under 9k thanks Amazon superfast delivery

"
"

  Samsung  is better to buy Chinese  product  this phone is good in this budget everything is good ..4.5 ratings outof 5..good made in india product

"
"

   I have received a faulty mobile. There is sound problem as well as app downloading problem also just within 5 days only after purchasing.After replacement also I got the same problematic mobile.

"
"

  This is something  beyond the review  I really appreciate  the work by the AMAZONhere they are really  changing  the INDIAN market when I ordered it in night  and got delivered by next morning also SAMSUNG  did a great job in budget friendly  smartphone

"
"

  Decent battery and performance. NOT FOR GAMING. Ordered for my mother for official work. So far gud. Good work samsung but work on your camera quality.

"
"

  Good backup phone. Love everything about the design at this price but for the position of the speaker vent. Sound quality could have been better.

"
"

  Normally low end Samsung gives poor output.I bought this one week ago.before I used redmi with same spec.comparatively very poor camera,clarity of screen,voice,processor speed.very low incoming voice .again disaster with Samsung mobile

"
"

  This phones suits just well in the price range of below 10k. It is handy as well as long lasting in case of battery. the screen of the device is pretty good and standard samsung screen. The only con i could feel in this device was no fingerprint.

"
"

  Niceeeee

"
"

  Good one to purchase with latest features at affordable price from Samsung with make in India .thank you

"
"

  No finger print feature..sound is very low while calling or listening to media files

"
"

  it is good product in less amount and the phone is in lite wieght so easy to carry and i had buyed it for online classes and now it is helpful to me thanks to amazon and samsung for releasing these product and amazon for fastest delivery in 3days thank you

"
"

  Battery drains very fast compared to my old one mobile too. Not a good product in this price. Can't recommend. Dont buy.

"
"

  This is an entry level smartphone of very good qualitySolid value for money

"
"

  Phone is very goodGood phone in this costNo finger print scanner but in this budget good battery life, good camera and good screen sizePhone is not sticking 3gb RAM is good

"
"

  Completely Dislike this Model. Need to return this but Amazon not taking back after a day of delivery. Very Bad performance and poor response getting from A big Brand. Really Disappointed. Pls replace my phone with another good option or refund my money.

"
"

  Best phone

"
"

  Good quality at that sigment. I was looking for Made in India Within 10k . And this is the best option I got in Amazon.

"
"

  I am giving this responce after 15 days using, i am not a gamer but have a app lover.Its an average phone with android 10 best part of it. Used as high app user without any lags best part of it.Overall a budget phone with needed requirement.

"
"

  I bought it first my mother they are facing difficulties with this produc chargingissue  and also volume issue  want to return it item by its past the warranty period 7 days it over by 14th and today is 19thKindly help

"
"

  Samsung m01 I bought this mobile on 7th sep .At the first time I checked my mobile incoming and outgoing calls it cut automatically itself. I registered compliant in Amazon. Don't buy this model (M01). Totally waste. I request you to refund my amount.

"
"

  Shelf life of samsung mobiles I an using are long lasting compared to Xioami or other Chinese product.  It is worth buying and better return of your money given the price it is best one.  I have been using samsung mobiles and liked interface and OS.

"
"

  This phone is worst in samsung phones. Camera quality is pathetic. Zero rating for camera. Packing of the mobile is poor. Charger quality is poor. Amazon doesn't take return. Its complete waste of money. Once you buy no help from amazon.

"
"

  Compact, sturdy and reliable phone ! Samsung's durability, feature set and reliability always stand strong. This phone is no exception. However, the top bar items are having very small fonts (eg battery % indicator)

"
"

  The phone is a very much handy and fulfills all the expectations in the mid budget category phone. There is only a small issue with speaker placed on the backside of the phone. Else it is worth a go.PS : Reviewed after a month of usage

"
"

  The product is good. Charging time takes not less than 3hours. It is not possible to charge in the urgent situation.. fast charging is not provided. Otherwise the product is good for nominal use.

"
"

"
"

  With in budget under 10000 if you want to go for brand like samsung go for it...dont even give a second thought

"
"

  I have received a fault piece I guess, the phone is not getting charged more than 27% even after 1 hour charging from last 2 days.The return window is also closed now, it is really disappointing experience with this phone.

"
"

  Battery life is better. No fingerprint sensor, camera is ok for the mobile price cost.

"
"

  Its good product...  batary life extraordinary,  camera qualitu awasome,  charing time very little comparive other products..  in this pandamic it very useful for children to attending online classes...  thank you samsung..

"
"

  Phone was ok for only calls and watching youtube vedios. Good for surfing, chattingNot for games if you play games In it gets heated fast 🙂

"
"

  Phone is good overall to the basic user, but after one month usage I got charging socket problum I handed over to service station they said the particular fail item is not available in the service station. I am very much disappointed.

"
"

  Purchasing samsung phones for third time still not happy with the camera clarity which is very much dissapointing with poor quality.Said its monster battery but its draining fast as previous samsung models

"
"

  I got very bad quality charger with this mobile. The phone does not get charged in full night. It charged only 2% in full night. Very bad quality charger. I am very upset after purching this product.  Can samsung help me in this problem.

"
"

  Charging is slow due to the 1A slow charger otherwise the phone is very good, battery lasts for at least two days and a complete value of money. Plus, the Samsung OneUI is quite smooth and fast. I'm happy with this purchase so far.

"
"

  for dayle base use it is a very good phone. batt. last 2days. camera ok. there is one issue that is heating of phone

"
"

  I am buy this mobile for my mother,she is very happy and also very simple to use. Nice packed on time very good material received. Thank you Amazon 🙏

"
"

  Could've included connectivity of wifi 5 GHz

"
"

  Perfectly sealed package delivered! Item in good condition...just the way I expected it to be!

"
"

  The phone quality is worst as the day i put sim in it got blacked out  please check n buy from trusted ones i had to get into Samsung's service to repair it

"
"

  This mobile is very small don't go by the description of it as provided also they don't not have any return policy very much disappointed with Amazon

"
"

  phone is good but in the same range,  smartphone has many features, the screen size is small.

"
"

  waste of money ....i order this mobile and after a week Mic doesn't work....and it doesn't replaced by Amazon ...worste mobile ever...

"
"

  Product is very good at this price range.  I don't expect this kind of service from Amazon. Defected piece received and applied for replacement on 1st Sept,  till date dispatch of product not done.

"
"

  I got good exchange offer for my phone .I got rs 3000 off for my last phone mi. Overall phone is good . Picture quality I would rate 4 star, camera 3star.

"
"

  Liked overall function and battery life of the mobile. Best thing was getting a good useful mobile in very reasonable price. Happy to own the product. Worth the money...

"
"

  Product is the best but i am not satisfied with emi option becos not provided the t&C and cut the direct installations charged without information

"
"

  Best product in indian market as per indian people to full fill basic requirement in low budget.Front camera quality is slightly less required to improve it.also more time required to charg the battery as compared to other brand .

"
"

  Value for moneyAmazing phone by SAMSUNG in this price segment.M01 has crazy features and look really love the colours.

"
"

  I bought Samsung wall mount TV before two years. That time I refused to wall mount the TV but now it's required. Is it possible to provide the wall mount kit now

"
"

  Best Mobile below 10k range

"
"

  It is simply agenda mobile phone, you have a smartphone. camera normal, battery good but finger lock not found as per discription.

"
"

  It's a good phone for Rs8300 but I  thought that Samsung could have give a better processor  and a fingerprint sensor for the price they are charging.  For people who use their phone massively I don't recommend this phone .

"
"

  Very poor display and look very old phoneCustomer service not satisfied.  refund not available totally M01 phone very bad display and look 2years old phone refused not worth for mony not worth for single star

"
"

  Good product for the price. Only drawback does not have finger print reader

"
"

  Likes : Display, Touch, Call Quality, Look, Audio.Averge: Camera & processor.Dislike : Charger (Very Very Slow) & data cable is very short

"
"

  fast delivery by Amazon....and value for money product.battery life is good, fingerprint reader and camera quality is good...go for it.... budget product.

"
"

  Highly recommend this phone. The  performance is good with a pretty decent camera quality, the battery life is really the best, the handling was really good and it was really smooth. Value to money. Maybe the best phone under 10k.

"
"

  Samsung is now becoming the worst mobile company, I would have taken much better phone in 80340. Battery life is worst, camera quality is not so good, and phone heats up so fast. Battery drains very fastly. I am so disappointed 😡

"
"

  Mobile is good in this price range, and most important Samsung is Korean Company and Mobile is Manufacturing is in India.Go for this Mobile instead of China based companies Mobile

"
"

  This is a value for money phone. real good at this price point. excellent phone to use. Samsung brand value is much higher

"
"

  worldwide is a Samsung one – that's almost as good as Apple's figures and way ahead of anyone else in the market besides the big two. And considering Samsung's phones are well built, powerful and stylish, it's no surprise either.

"
"

  Good looking

"
"

  Med-budget phone .Good for normal use but gets  allot heated if heavily used.Battery life is ok as it is a med budget phone .Camera quality  is excellent .Overall it is a good phone for normal users.....

"
"

  Very good budget phone battery life lasts longer it has good processor average picture quality

"
"

  Dont go jsust don't go for any other product or brand. Camera waqq my button phone has better camera screen 720 p so not to go for this .if you want good phone then mi 9i may be good in this range

"
"

  Dolby atmos is not functioning. Youtube application doesn't work properly. All together there is no proper quality control. It not suggested product for someone who is expecting quality.

"
"

  Overall it is a good mobile but cannot find 4G option

"
"

  Very handy and perfect  size with good battery life and except gaming  app ,all apps are working fine . Camera  quality  is not bad as per the price. Voice quality  is also good.Overall, excellent  phone  in this  price.

"
"

  It works just well. Only the fingerprint scanner can be made better

"
"

  Front camera is not good. When we take a selfie with front camera it looks like artificial effect on the pic & when you zoom it pic will start to blur.

"
"

  It's good

"
"

  Pros:Nice build quality;Nice display;Light weight;Nice UI;Cons:Average camera,Average audio,No fingerprintBest for parents only

"
"

  The form foctor is great for one handed use. Display is of very good quality. For 8400 its a steal

"
"

  Screen flickering issue. After system update and hard reset (as suggested by customer service representative) it's the same. Now it is not even replaceable due to minimum stock.Please do not buy this phone.

"
"

  Basic feature like casting is not there ....Check before ordering

"
"

  Can't use it in the dark even at the lowest brightness.Little heavy for such a small size.

"
"

  The Phone was awesome...Best phone for online classes...best battery life..Front camera is awesome...🥰🥰I loved it.. it is aa best for normal use...phone display was awesome and amazing....

"
"

  I am very disappointed about breadth size.  But overall is good.

"
"

  Osm camera.... I had ever seen in this budget phone. Long battery life about 36hr.after full charging..finally mast mobile 👌😊

"
"

  Good battery life and smooth running phone, camera quality is cheap as it doesn't goes with the brand name, Samsung should have done better with camera, overall great phone, just missing the fingerprint sensor

"
"

  Touch is not working . I have buyed one month before only.. Samsung phones quality is so wrost . 4 Months before also I have buyed for my uncle . Even that mobile also same issue .. two mobiles gone

"
"

  It's really a nice phone the camera is pretty good at such price. Battery life is really good.  One thing I must tell you that it's not that a bad phone as negatively reviewed by lots of YouTubers.

"
"

  Battery is average. UI is also ok. To sum up all this good average mobile. Issue with heating while charging. This needs to be addressed.

"
"

  Ideal phone for normal user. Battery life is impressive. Screen brightness is very good. Software experience is top notch.

"
"

  Very helpful phone espically for student battery life is awesome my class goes for 4 hours after charching to 100% it just drain about 15% of battery.Not perfer for palying game rather than than best phone.

"
"

  एक नंबर का घटिया और बकवास मोबाइल है अमेजॉन कंपनी से मत खरीदना.

"
"

  Good smartphone.

"
"

  Great value for money. Right alternative for other Chinese brands

"
"

  Good budget phone but it is too small to carry and camera quality is cheap on both side(front+back), Speaker doesn't work properly sometimes, But Battery is Great in budget you can buy it for trusted brand

"
"

  Its not upto the mark.. and for your kind information.. every electronic products is just replaceable at given time.. no return policy.  So pls check before buy.. infinity times.. once bought cannot be returned back.!

"
"

  Its compact feel better for day today normal usage. Very good mobile for all users who require a handy good looking Mobile which can perform all the task well.. display is good... Most practical phone in this price.

"
"

  Good looking compact size & Value of money

"
"

  The phone was defective. The sim card slot could not be opened. I applied for a return and it was accepted. Now the return period is over and I still have the defective phone which I cannot use.

"
"

  The product is satisfactory and received on time

"
"

  I have ordered this phone phone for my father. Its almost 15 days and phone is working good. I would recommend this phone

"
"

  Great phone within 10k. Smooth function. Good battery life. Nil flaws noticed after use of 5 days. A must purchase if u r looking for a phone under 10k. Overall a good phone.

"
"

  Good look, fast speed, and camera quality is good .Battery life is 24 hrs even after non stop usage .Ui is so interesting.Best deal in this price range from samsung.

"
"

  Satisfied

"
"

  I liked the whole mobile

"
"

  I purchased this product from Amazon ,from day one it is not working properly there is some hanging problem and auto speaking assistance working.Also Amazon not providing good service as compare to Flipkart

"
"

  Initial impressionA bit heavy, due to high density and thickness is high. Display is good but not great under direct sun, performance is what I will address in next edit of this review.

"
"

  Packaging was good.. im happy with the purchase and product.. ❤ camera quality is okay okayy..

"
"

  It's a really very good phone... In a worth price... Wonderfull service by samsung... 3 gb ram and 32 gb stoarage is enough in this price....Well done samsung👍

"
"

  Its gud product...in this price range..i am avoiding chinese made product...so this is gud .

"
"

  The battery life is satisfactory.At this price display is wonderful.The dimensions are perfect.I'm loving it.Recommended  to all those who want a quality smart phone at affordable price.

"
"

  Overall value for money, light weight, elegant design, good processor speed, battery life is good, camera average,I buy that because I'm not fan of big screen phones

"
"

  After 8 days only not working properly. Now I can not return this product. My Rs 8400 lost.

"
"

  Awesome phone by Samsung at this price range....camera quality and the video quality is the best in this phone.I bought it for my mother. Even the look of the phone is classy. The battery back up is also nice.

"
"

  Good battery life.No finger print sensorPoor camera qualityHigher priceFast processor

"
"

  Samsung M01 is nice mobile phone. Its very economical and with all essential features.

"
"

  The most thing i like with this phone that there is no heating issue. Great battery back up. Looks slim & attracting. Available on best price with amazon. I highly recommended to go with this phone.

"
"

  You r asking for rate the fingerprint reader but there is no such. The phone is all good except heating effect of phone after an hour of use.rest camera is just ok .. And phone is good to say just good ... Ok

"
"

  Good batteryGood processorGood displayBut camera is not upto the mark ☹️But value for money

"
"

  Excellent battery life and cheap and best smartphone.

"
"

  Don't buy this product,Because I brought this and 7 days later it switched off automatically and I pressed longly but it not oned and vibrant's unstoppableAmazon says all not thruth all faurd

"
"

  Decent phone bit in bulky and heavy side. Camera good, battery good and overall its upto the user to decide. To my opinion budget category phone with Samsung branding that's enough. 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏

"
"

  Battery lasts for more than 16 hours after charging only for once.Camera quality is just amazing.Samsung cameras are always the best.Fingerprint reader is the cherry on the top.

"
"

  It's good,one hand handling phone.I really like it. Thanks for the offer replacing my Nokia-2 . But it's smaller(5.5) then in that specifications,instead of 5.7 inch. Anyway it's good after all.

"
"

  This mobile good in this price but charging of this phone is very slow. Samsung is a good brand in mobile.

"
"

  Excellent product by Samsung battery life is very good awesome camera quality very good  totally it's very good product

"
"

  The Camera quality is very bad and the support I'm getting from Amazon it's not expected from Company like amazon

"
"

  Good phone for normal daily usage.Performance was good but cant play heavy games.Camera was average.Display is good.mobile is little bulky with case.

"
"

  Waste of Money there is no fingerprint sensor available but shown in technical specifications.Too thick phone don't go for it they r cheating

"
"

  phone was  heating,charging time very long 4 hrs to  full, camera ok average,i  buy this phone only one reason this is a non chineese, make in  india phone, battry backup not  very good as desire.

"
"

  Produt is good but dont buy it through Amazon because return/replacement policies are not clear in online shopping portal. Many more things comes to know about return/replacement polocy after shopping..

"
"

  I will I could give a zero but I can't. The phone was not working from the one. Amazon didn't replace or refund my money. The phone was fixed but still has problems. I don't recommend buying this phone.

"
"

  Battery life is good. Easy to handle and fits in hands... little bit expensive...600 rs dropped just after bought by me...is there any way to get my 600 back.... overall good buy....

"
"

  Very good phone because of it's compact size ,no lag is seen in day to day usage , battery last for 24hrs in moderate usage. Overall best phone if anyone for alternative for Xiaomi and realme

"
"

  Network is not good and video also when we do video call. Unable to here other voice.Worst performance and quality was not good.Don't buy this phone worst quality.

"
"

  It’s good product. Specially value for money. This is manufacturing in India (I love that) designed by sumsung. No handing screen.

"
"

  Camera quality is very good in day light but not so efficient in tube light. Battery life is also very good. There is no button in drop down menu for screen-shot.

"
"

  It's really a nice phone actually I bought it for my wife after a long time I replaced her old mobile with this one and this time she is very happy and showing more love towards me

"
"

  4G signal strength and speaker also not good. Average cell phone.

"
"

  Product is good but Fingerprint security is not avlable in handset.

"
"

  Suitable for middle income group

"
"

  Camera is reasonably good. Battery life and user interface is good.Best in the price range.The device has no fingerprint reader.  Not advisable for games and extensive media users.

"
"

  Truly economical

"
"

  Nice phone at this price point, but the only concern is that it supports lte and not volte.

"
"

  One of the third class mobile phone, once it will be dropped from your hand, and its glass will be breaked.  Don't buy Samsung Galaxy smartphones,  one of the cheapest quality smartphones

"
"

  Overall a good phone in the price. Samsung should provide fast charging now with basic phones as well

"
"

  I used this phone from last few day's. A battery of this phone is good enough for daily usage. Camera quality is not that adequate, its average. No fingerprint, face unlocks is poor.

"
"

  This mobile value for money. It is worth to take. The battery life is good and camera quality is best. If anyone looking for mobile within the range of 9000 rupees I happily recommend this mobile.

"
"

  Ordered this for my mom who is not an ardent user of her phone and this was the right choice with an easy to use interface and good battery back up. Also,  the packaging was really good!

"
"

  Getting calls disconnected often

"
"

  Awesome product at this price.

"
"

  Average performance,.. fast battery drain,.. lengthy 4.5 hours of charging time,.. 10-15hrs of battery backup .. whatevwr else, problems are not many but battery life matters..

"
"

  I was having a 1GB mobile. Now with Samsung quality and 3GB mobile , it is amazing. Very Happy

"
"

  Product is fine .But the delivery experience was the worst. I would recommend other online shopping sites for proper delivery. Amazon is certainly below par. Really disappointed with the delivery

"
"

  Battery life is great.  Easily 24 hours wide heavy usage. The most important is it's compact size.  Very easy with single hand and easy in pocket also.  Light weight and sturdy innhands

"
"

  Best entry level phone from Samsung.  Good battery life. Build quality is good. Worth every penny  paid. We have exchanged old mobile and got good discount .

"
"

  Good for normal internet browsing messaging and youtube usage. Light weight and camera could have been betterBut most importantly it's not Chinese made

"
"

  Phone is getting heated and amazon is not helping properly in replacing the item.. Very much disappointed

"
"

  The phone is little heavy but have awesome features, touch and camera quality is really good 👍👍👍

"
"

  Excellent smartphone at this price

"
"

  Always a best product from Samsung. Looks like very advanced in face lock.Battery life is awesome. And camera is very sharp.  Very good value for money. I recommend this product.

"
"

  Very worst product  don't purchase I am facing alot of problem ,Amazon sell more product with third party which are very bad in term of quality please  avoided to purchase this mobile.

"
"

  When I receive or make a call, it is disconnecting after one minute. Really frustrating. hHow samsung make mobile like this?

"
"

  This is an amazing phn in this price range..... Absolutely no lags..... Display is damn awesome  and its absolutely handy..... the blue variant looks really premium..... very smooth device.....

"
"

  Very slow processing and battery backup very bad charger and data cable not good quality.  I want to return but not accept by Amazon.  This item is like a duplicate or replaced not an original.

"
"

  dont waste ur  money by purchasing this type of worst products, worst camera and people cant hear the phone call . i from now onwards i will not purchase any samsung product

"
"

  Screen quality is top notch. Battery life is a little bad. For day to day usage it's fine. Call quality is good. Phone is fast enough. Highly recommended budget phone for non-gamers.

"
"

  No yet all recommended. Poor audio or speaker quality. Charging taking too much time. Before purchasing, I thought that Samsung might of improved the product. But the product is almost waste.

"
"

  One of the good product from SAMSUNG in budget segment. I am using this cell phone from last 2 months without any issue. If you have budget under Rs.10k then you can go ahead with this model.

"
"

  Good mobile but size too small

"
"

  I buyed this for my mom and its good for the normal tasks but if u r buying for PUBG so dont buy it and camera quality is also not so good just ok okThis is a perfect phone for parents

"
"

  Good product for daily usage at this price point. Getting one UI on basic smartphone is amazing

"
"

  Best budget phone... Apart from Camera overall performance is good...Go for Samsung brand, Instead of fake configuration by rest.

"
"

  I have added total protection for Rs.349 but it not appliedPlease bdo the needful...

"
"

  Earphone not received with mobile.....not satisfied with Samsung giving this type of service

"
"

  I bought M01 for my dad. Since it has 4000mah battery it's stands all day for him to watch youtube videos. It's lot more easy to use than China phones.

"
"

  Front camera is ok. Back camera is not up to mark. Screen share option of Samsung is not available in this model is another draw back.

"
"

  I MISS SUPER AMOLED DISPLAY ON THIS SAMSUNG GALAXY M01.YOU GET TFT DISPLAY ON THIS M01 SMARTPHONE.OVERALL GOOD

"
"

  After software upgrade phone not recognising the SIM card both in Sim 1 & 2

"
"

  The phone is very small in size. Camera quality not upto the mark. A very big disappointment.They don't even give a return policy. I am not satisfy with the size of the phone. Poor.

"
"

  Good phone at this price. Please go for it

"
"

  Thank you samsung and Amazon for timely rakshabandhan delivery.Now for readers this is a review unbiased and written after testing and continuous usage :-Pro's1.Screen ppi is great as entry level device✌2.Battery backup is awesome thanks to samsungs R&D even with .7mamp charger.👀3.Android go version 10 is cute without craps4.Reading pdfs is easy and comfort for eyes atleast samsung has guts to say the truth.5.No lag till now because i dont need gaming other than that all regular even without go apps are nicely running.6.fingerprint and face lock i dont need so good they are not provided.7.Call quality is okay.Speaker is normal.8.For music lovers dowload any music app with equilizer will be fine.9.16gb/32gb and sd card is okay.10.Auto smart memory cleaner(use smart manager in settings once a day) for smooth RAM functioning and ROM cleaning🤗11. Supports OTG as well.Cons1. Camera below average still expected but samsung should work more on this front if they wanna beat chinese phones.2.Not for gamers and thats expected buy a 4gb Ram 🤔 based phone why reading me?😉3.finger print and face lock missing I Can manage but most indians can't.4.Battery takes 3.15 hours to charge to work for 12 hours of calling and surfing and thats not bad at all but can be issue for chinese phone lovers who have habit of charging again and again to play pubg.Overall out of 5.Camera-2  Gui-4  Screen ppi-5  speed-4  android-4Don't buy a phone only because of specifications must see integration and longevity overall a nice secondary option and primary for featured phone switchers.

"
"

  Very smooth UI latest M series .Battery is good. 3000mahIt has dark mode.Apps run smoothly.Camera is average.Best for secondary phone.Apps are of GO versionWiFi calling feature.

"
"

  I free of cost taken this phone for I show my friends in WhatsApp & facebook this phone a budget phone and full specification and more sell for samsung smartphones.

"
"

  Its not working. Pls don't buy this phone. Listen carefully, Only on August 14th 2020 I bought this, but today 23.08.2020 its not working. I couldn't even switch this mobile on. Samsung Galaxy M01 mobile. Mobile is not worth. As today I came to amazon for return or replacement this cheater has closed the return window by yesterday. How cunning they are ? not even ten days its been since I have bought. This cheaters have closed it. Its not working now.  Even if I call toll free numbers no one responses.

"
"

  The phone suddenly went completely dead within 10 minutes of switching it on after receiving it. Asked for a return, but the delivery boy didn't take the return because the phone is dead! Again request a return. Waiting to see what happens now. Can not take it to any shop or dealer as it is purchased online.

"
"

  After using 4/5 days suddenly without notice, the phone shutdown automatically and I couldn't restart it. So contact with amazon for replacing it and get very quick response from their end and they book a time slot to verify it by a technician. But after few hours later I found in start up guide send by Samsung,  how to restart when it stops working or hanged( by pressing power and volume key simultaneously for seven seconds or more). The fault is from the end of Samsung company I suppose, because they should mention the process on the front page with bold letter. Most of the reviews which get 1 star facing the same problems like of mine.  After using one month I want to add some extra points which impressed me.1. Sound quality and graphics are very good.2. Smooth touch sensitivity3. Ringtones are much louder.4.Two volte nano SIM s work fine together.5.Battery backup is good. Charging time is not so lengthy.6.Any SIM can be switched off manually, that impressed me.7. 2GB ram and 32 GB storage is better option for budget friendly people.8. I faced hanging problem for one day only till now , which can be easily solved by pressing volume down key and power key simultaneously for 7 seconds or more.8. Lastly this mobile is Made in India which I like the most.  So any one can go for it. Amazon agents are really helpful which I experienced.

"
"

  Thanks Amazon for delivering the product as mentioned in the product description. It was well packed and delivered.By the way, A Special Thanks to SAMSUNG for stepping up to INDIA's needs and introducing a new Line of Phones for taking on the Chinese Incursions in Indian Mobile Phone Market.We ordered ""Samsung Galaxy M01 Core (Blue, 2GB RAM, 32GB Storage)"" and thrown away the chinese phone Salomi as it had 100 other Apps Pre-Installed without our information and heating phone and draining battery. Had a tough times using that 'Salomi' phone. Now with a GOOD / BETTER Phone from GOOD Company Samsung, happy to own this ""Little Cute Phone"".Samsung Galaxy M01 Core (Blue, 2GB RAM, 32GB Storage) -- is a small enough to keep in pockets and has all the Latest Android 10 OS with a Good Display.  -- All latest version of Apps in a lite mode which means what we need only will be loaded and given instead of ""loading all forever"" and wasting our Precious Data.-- A good Camera with Samsung Reliability is known for its Crisp Camera and Displays.What else needed in a phone. Thanks SAMSUNG for bringing a new Affordable Range with Latest Android 10 OS.Way to go SAMSUNG. Surely we INDIANS will support SAMSUNG and make it to No.1 Company by replacing the Chinese Mobile Companies in INDIA.

"

  Not bad....can suggest this mbl for normal users.... charging speed is very much disappointed , taking lot of time to charge up ....basic charger type not even USB cable....this suits for parents only ....not for youngsters, gamers etc.

"
"

  I am writing this review after the usage of 15 days. It is one of the worst phones Samsung has made with multiple issues. Me and my friend both purchased the same phone for our aunts and are facing the same issues. The main issue I am facing is that the phone switched off 2 days back and since then I am trying to switch it on but its leading me nowhere. Neither it is charging. Phone heats up while charging as well as in normal usage conditions. While charging the phone heats up to an extent that one may feel that it could blast. My friend also faced the phone off issue but it was resolved automatically after 2 days when he connected a fast carger to the phone. He is too facing the heating issue. His phone still switches off on its own again and again now and then... All we both are able to do is to regret on wastage of our money.

"
"

  I have recieved this phone on 14th of August 2020 and today is 24th of August 2020.So After 10 Days i am reviewing this phone because i have seen many negative reviews on amazon review portal so now my true experience is about this phone following.1:- Processor Media tek Quad core Is best because quad core take less power from battry than the octa core processor. and i purchased this phone for my mom so quad core porcessor is sufficient to my mom.2:- Battry life is good because of Quad Core Processor.3:- Ram is 2Gb that is also sufficient4:- Display as always awesome as samsung provide.5:- Mike and Speaker's quality is too good as always samsung provide.6:- Many People said in the review that the mobile is automatically swiched off and on automatically. yes i have seen this my own only one time. but its not the problem. every new phone have done this one time because of system works smoothly. and after one time switch off on things happen then never repeated till my 10 days of use this phone. so you people who is taking switch off on problem very seriously ,you should not. this is one time process when phone is new sometimes phone may swich off and on automatically. so dont panik at all for this.7:- most of the people want to replace the phone because of one time switch off on problem then i have to say one thing that your first phone is the only phone who is brand new and the replaced phone never be a new phone at all . so never replace your new phone. this is my own experience.8:- I am fully satisfied from this phone in this price of 6499.9:-This is all the reason that is why i am giving 5 star this phone.Thank U Samsung.

  I free of cost taken this phone for I show my friends in WhatsApp & facebook this phone a budget phone and full specification and more sell for samsung smartphones.

  Its not working. Pls don't buy this phone. Listen carefully, Only on August 14th 2020 I bought this, but today 23.08.2020 its not working. I couldn't even switch this mobile on. Samsung Galaxy M01 mobile. Mobile is not worth. As today I came to amazon for return or replacement this cheater has closed the return window by yesterday. How cunning they are ? not even ten days its been since I have bought. This cheaters have closed it. Its not working now.  Even if I call toll free numbers no one responses.

"
"

  The phone suddenly went completely dead within 10 minutes of switching it on after receiving it. Asked for a return, but the delivery boy didn't take the return because the phone is dead! Again request a return. Waiting to see what happens now. Can not take it to any shop or dealer as it is purchased online.

"
"

  After using 4/5 days suddenly without notice, the phone shutdown automatically and I couldn't restart it. So contact with amazon for replacing it and get very quick response from their end and they book a time slot to verify it by a technician. But after few hours later I found in start up guide send by Samsung,  how to restart when it stops working or hanged( by pressing power and volume key simultaneously for seven seconds or more). The fault is from the end of Samsung company I suppose, because they should mention the process on the front page with bold letter. Most of the reviews which get 1 star facing the same problems like of mine.  After using one month I want to add some extra points which impressed me.1. Sound quality and graphics are very good.2. Smooth touch sensitivity3. Ringtones are much louder.4.Two volte nano SIM s work fine together.5.Battery backup is good. Charging time is not so lengthy.6.Any SIM can be switched off manually, that impressed me.7. 2GB ram and 32 GB storage is better option for budget friendly people.8. I faced hanging problem for one day only till now , which can be easily solved by pressing volume down key and power key simultaneously for 7 seconds or more.8. Lastly this mobile is Made in India which I like the most.  So any one can go for it. Amazon agents are really helpful which I experienced.

  Thanks Amazon for delivering the product as mentioned in the product description. It was well packed and delivered.By the way, A Special Thanks to SAMSUNG for stepping up to INDIA's needs and introducing a new Line of Phones for taking on the Chinese Incursions in Indian Mobile Phone Market.We ordered ""Samsung Galaxy M01 Core (Blue, 2GB RAM, 32GB Storage)"" and thrown away the chinese phone Salomi as it had 100 other Apps Pre-Installed without our information and heating phone and draining battery. Had a tough times using that 'Salomi' phone. Now with a GOOD / BETTER Phone from GOOD Company Samsung, happy to own this ""Little Cute Phone"".Samsung Galaxy M01 Core (Blue, 2GB RAM, 32GB Storage) -- is a small enough to keep in pockets and has all the Latest Android 10 OS with a Good Display.  -- All latest version of Apps in a lite mode which means what we need only will be loaded and given instead of ""loading all forever"" and wasting our Precious Data.-- A good Camera with Samsung Reliability is known for its Crisp Camera and Displays.What else needed in a phone. Thanks SAMSUNG for bringing a new Affordable Range with Latest Android 10 OS.Way to go SAMSUNG. Surely we INDIANS will support SAMSUNG and make it to No.1 Company by replacing the Chinese Mobile Companies in INDIA.

  Not bad....can suggest this mbl for normal users.... charging speed is very much disappointed , taking lot of time to charge up ....basic charger type not even USB cable....this suits for parents only ....not for youngsters, gamers etc.

  I am writing this review after the usage of 15 days. It is one of the worst phones Samsung has made with multiple issues. Me and my friend both purchased the same phone for our aunts and are facing the same issues. The main issue I am facing is that the phone switched off 2 days back and since then I am trying to switch it on but its leading me nowhere. Neither it is charging. Phone heats up while charging as well as in normal usage conditions. While charging the phone heats up to an extent that one may feel that it could blast. My friend also faced the phone off issue but it was resolved automatically after 2 days when he connected a fast carger to the phone. He is too facing the heating issue. His phone still switches off on its own again and again now and then... All we both are able to do is to regret on wastage of our money.

  I have recieved this phone on 14th of August 2020 and today is 24th of August 2020.So After 10 Days i am reviewing this phone because i have seen many negative reviews on amazon review portal so now my true experience is about this phone following.1:- Processor Media tek Quad core Is best because quad core take less power from battry than the octa core processor. and i purchased this phone for my mom so quad core porcessor is sufficient to my mom.2:- Battry life is good because of Quad Core Processor.3:- Ram is 2Gb that is also sufficient4:- Display as always awesome as samsung provide.5:- Mike and Speaker's quality is too good as always samsung provide.6:- Many People said in the review that the mobile is automatically swiched off and on automatically. yes i have seen this my own only one time. but its not the problem. every new phone have done this one time because of system works smoothly. and after one time switch off on things happen then never repeated till my 10 days of use this phone. so you people who is taking switch off on problem very seriously ,you should not. this is one time process when phone is new sometimes phone may swich off and on automatically. so dont panik at all for this.7:- most of the people want to replace the phone because of one time switch off on problem then i have to say one thing that your first phone is the only phone who is brand new and the replaced phone never be a new phone at all . so never replace your new phone. this is my own experience.8:- I am fully satisfied from this phone in this price of 6499.9:-This is all the reason that is why i am giving 5 star this phone.Thank U Samsung.

  Poor Quality. Phone is not functional after 2 days of use. I bought it as a spare phone and didn't use much or neither downloaded any big apps. Phone is not getting on. It has happened under 7 days of delivery and I made a return on Amazon but it's not showing any confirmation or clarity. Waste of money.

"
"

  Product is good in that budgetAnd performance is excellent

"
"

  The bad part of this mobile was that it lasted only half day. Next morning it did not work even after charging and trying everything possible, but what's WORST IS AMAZON RETURN PROCESS. Highly disappointed with Amazon process it took me approx 4 days and 2 hours of phone calls to get the defective product returned.

"
"

  #Very poor camera.#Battery ok but slow charging.#I got this in exchange for 3.8k ,  So , I am satisfied.# M10 was far far better.#gaming ok#worst part is camera.dont expect any nice  pics.#small screen so easy to handle.#overall 3.9star I'll give,coz you own samsung at such cost.# may be bigger M01 is better.

"
"

  Major issue with this phone is slow charging and quick battery draining. Look of handset is sleek and smart but charer is Normal(Non-USB). To connect with other devices like laptop, PC, you will need to purchase extra USB cable. Backside of phone get heated if using for long time like an hour or more. I was recording video on 14.08.2020 and in 15-20 minutes, phone get overheated and I stopped video recording.

  Update 16 Oct 20Samsung service is trying to push manufacturing defects as my fault. They are playing with small users. Please be careful buying any Samsung product as they are operating like a fly-by-night company.I've already spent Rs. 3,000 for a Rs. 6,000 phone without a working phone for the last 1 month.Update on 29 Sep 20.Reducing status to 1 star.The phone is increasingly giving problems.a) The screen responsiveness is getting worse.b)  The SD card is always giving error.c) Taking lots of time to load Apps.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I exchanged my Samsung On5 for Samsung M01 Core mainly because of the lack of internal memory. Good sturdy experience of On5 let me to buy this phone. I have no complaints about the hardware though many of the software have regressed from On5. Let me write them down:1. Samsung On5 running on Android 6 was more stable than current Android 10. It has rebooted atleast twice on it's own.2. Camera has no panorama and other mode which was there in On5.3. Chrome hanged twice during this period.4. SD card stopped reading once. Had to push it back again to work. Never happened in On5.5. Do Not Disturb can't be customized. Samsung On5 had it.6. Unread SMS not highlighted.Go version shouldn't mean regression. I'll be happy to discuss with the architects who would want genuine op

"
"

  I wud have given no star but unfortunately there's no such option. The mobile stops reading the sim card often on the second day of use. When tried to replace the item quoting defective product, they ask me to install an app to solve the problem and the app itself doesn't work. IT SUCKS. My money got wasted.

"
"

  It has all the basic features and the interface is quite smooth. It has support to wi-fi calling also. Overall the phone is good value for the money spent on it.

"
"

  Samsung is loting money by giving worst product I am using this phone after one month it started and stop working saying overheating if I watch movie for half an hour of video call for half an hour

"
"

  It's really value for money 💰🙂...The phone comes with a 5.30-inch touchscreen display with a resolution of 720x1480 pixels and an aspect ratio of 18.5:9. Samsung Galaxy M01 Core is powered by a 1.5GHz quad-core MediaTek MT6739 processor. It comes with 1GB of RAM. The Samsung Galaxy M01 Core runs Android Go Edition and is powered by a 3000mAh battery.As far as the cameras are concerned, the Samsung Galaxy M01 Core on the rear packs 8-megapixel camera. The rear camera setup has autofocus. It sports a 5-megapixel camera on the front for selfies.

"
"

  Too much lagging as like there is only 250 MB RAM.Disappointed with the slowness of the device (I have already updated the software to latest version).

"
"

  Nice product

"
"

  The battery 🔋 is totally worst and touch is very bad charging is also not proper.

"
"

  Samsung didn't meet my expectations this time. I had been a big fan of Samsung products and this product of theirs disappointed me. Battery gets hot while watching videos, playing games and when connected to the net. Battery drains fast. Not suitable for video calls. Although I bought a 2GB RAM version, video and voice keeps cutting in and out. Tried different networks. No earphones. Cheap looking charger. Samsung should not compromise on quality. If they cannot afford to release a budget phone, they should not. Instead, continue with their mid and high range phones.

"
"

  since day one sim slot is not properly working, some times it is showing ""insert sim"" error. Then again i have to restart the phone or reinsert the sim to connect the phone. I changed the sim card, then also same problem is continuing and it is clear that there is problem in sim slot. hence pl arrange to replace the phone at the earliest.

"
"

   I recieved this  item on 9this August, it was working fine. But just after 9 days, this  phone not  charging.  I  try  with  two  other charger. The  phone also  get  discharged. It is not  going  on. Also  if it is put for  charging,  the  charging icon  not on and  this phone  not  charging.

"
"

  It's a 2GB phone, you can't expect much, even Facebook lags while going through lots of browsing. The camera is Ok. The build is not good, you must use a rubber cover and temper protection. It has a 3000mah battery that's why discharges quickly and doesn't support fast charging which creates more problems. Overall what you can expect at such a cost?Analyze your needs before purchasing it. The phone is decent for household usage with few apps, but if you want to have multiple apps then don't go for it..

"
"

  Gr8 phone at the price of 6,500 from Samsung. As of now everything looks fine.

"
"

  The mobile contains  poor battery quality. 80% of charge has been drained in 3 hours with average use. Do not buy it to waste your money.Amazon will mention to return or replace product within 7 days, at the time of purchase .But in actual they will delay unnecessarily and will pass the time frame , by different protocols, as nobody can return it . Even if it is  a faulty set and there is a chance to return it.

"
"

  Everything is good as per phone price but only one thing I don’t like in this phone that is when u continues use it for 25-30 minutes it start getting heat which is not good

"
"

  This mobile is giving very poor quality of audio with breaking voice in zoom video call. I applied for return policy, but they did not accepting for return. I was shocked due to this kind of behaviour from Amazon. I will put a case through online , if they will not take return.

"
"

  Not a good phone, waste of money

"
"

  First time in life I dared to purchase a phone from Amazon. First time a Samsung phone I bought stopped working went dead within a few hours.  Later Amazon agents kept on visiting but deny to pick up the product saying it is dead.. 4 times. I kept on calling customer care in 6 or 7 calls the phone is not picked up by return agent in 15 days. Money is with Amazon. Which means Amazon is using the money. Not sure how many escalations i have to make replace the productThe product might be good but buying it from Amazon iz a pain.If you are unlucky and phone is dead you will keep begging for return. Your money will be stuck with Amazon.WORST way Amazon India treats the Customer. Better use Amazon not cheap products

"
"

  Good product.Works well and looks stylish. Ideal for thousands of people who use the internet and call features intelligently. It's non-Chinese so adds to patriotism .Very economical and absolutely value for money.Excellent service by Amazon too! Highly recommended!

"
"

  I ignored the negative reviews, especially those about receiving phones that would not turn on.  I paid the price for it.  I received a phone that never turned on- defective.  But, then the worst part was yet to come.  The wait for an inspection.  Then, the worst bit about waiting a few weeks for amazon to pick the package back.  I understand that amazon did its best in these circumstances in the COVID scenario.  I would strongly suggest that this model could be best avoided.  Samsung should seriously consider withdrawing models such as these which are a shame.

"
"

  Touch screen not working from first day of use. I requested for replace the mobile after few days delivery boy says Amazon app should have the Amazon app, the problem is I can't install the app without screen function. Still waiting Amazon to solve the problem

"
"

  Not worth 5000/- at all but perfectly worth 2800/- if ever available at this price point... LoLBasic feature handheld. Nothing much to sport or brag about. Basic functions. Smooth body and surface. Screen brightness that blinds. Crisp camera for a budget phone. All else, simply rubbish! Let your maidservant or kid play around with it instead. Haha!

"
"

  Excellent phone in low budget.Light weight phone .Good phone for old age people

"
"

  Good handset of Samsung under budget , as battery mAh is 3000 gives normal performance depends upon usage and takes time to charge too . As I bought it for my dad and it's good for elders as its comfy for use !!

"
"

  Definitely Samsung is a very good brand and we can blindly do faith on it.Phone is really good.Build quality is very good and battery life is awesome.Camera is just average bcoz we can't expect bery high quality in this price range.Sound quality is also average.Overall it is really a good deal in this price range but if we compare it with MI in this range. The. MI definitely has a lead over it.Redmi 8a dual is best substitute to this phone.

"
"

  I used may types of android mobiles I purchased this mobile for my Mother and also to test how Android GO works.Things I Like in this device:-1. Camera - When I see the feature of 8MP Primary Camera, I thought that cameras may be average in this device.  But, in real the camera clarity was awesome at the price I real didn't expect this Samsung surprised  me. Even the Front 5MP camera also chapters clear pictures.  Rear Camera has dedicated flash and surprisingly Front Camera has Screen Flash(Good See this).***Camera samples - Cell Tower, Charger and Spectacles were captured with Samsung M01 Core. Other Pictures were captured by Some other devices.2. Display - Many companies who were selling the devices at 10k even above range are still providing HD+ (720P)  screen. But, I really felt happy that we are getting excellent display with good viewing angles at 5-6k.  But, we need to note that it is TFT display, not IPS display.3. Design - Samsung is providing mate texture finish at the back, Ofcourse it is made of cheap plastic it will  definitely protect the devices from scratches.4. Operating System - This device comes with Android GO which is the lite version of Android. But, it comes with  latest  Android 10 out of the box. And Android will provided updates regularly. I bought  2GB RAM variant and installed may apps(Not much larger apps, but some general purpose  apps) I didn't find any lagging issues while using them.5. Battery - This Device comes with 3000mah battery, but I noticed that Samsung mentioned that this was  typically, which means 3000mah was not the exact rating. But, still it's ok to have that capacity in this  device. As Android GO is the lighter version it almost consumes very less battery. You watch 4-5 hours  of YouTube videos with single charge. So definitely it is more at the price.Think I didn't like:-1. Very low charger rating - Out of the box it comes with 5V - 0.7A charger (3.5W) which is very slow to charger  3000mah battery. It takes 3+ hours to full charger the device. I have 10W fast charger  with me I tried to charger with that, I was charging up but still taking 3+ hours to  charge it. So, it won't accept fast charge. As a costumer we expect at least 10W  charger at the price.2. No Face Unlock - Face Unlock feature is very common in every device now. But, this feature was missing. They  are providing PIN, PATTERN and PASSWORD options to secure your device.3. Price - Actually, this is my bad luck. when I placed the order the price of the product is 6,499/- and I paid the  full amount online. It takes 2days to reach it to me, when I received the order the product price went  down to 5,999/-.

  the best thing is it is android 10.then 1 gb ram ok but  if 2gb ram then very goodstorage is very goodcamera okdisplay size if it would5.5 inch so very good but its 5.3it is not ips lcd display it is hd+ tft displaybattery also ok for normal usageeverything is good in its price

  True Reviews,Worst phone in the world. Don’t see the YouTube reviews and buy this phone they are just lying. I wanted to give it less than one star but there was no option. I looks good in photos but is very very small phone. It lags and sticks a lot even in 2GB ram. A never buy product. Camera is freakin’ waste. They say it has 12MP camera but actually is like 2MP. The apps keep exiting themselves.And says app not responding. The WORST PHONE. Don’t buy this is my honest review. I bought it today and returned the phone on the same day it self within hours . If you wanna waste your money then invest in this phone . The packing and everything is rather soo good but phone does not function good at all.Thank You.

"
"

  Video playback as well as camera is not smooth even though it's meant to run HD videos.Tried to return the product but Amazon initiated replacement procedure by saying that particular piece is faulty, however new piece is also having same issues and I can't see replace/ return option anymore.In conclusion, the hardware is not compatible with specification. Don't go for this product and bad service from Amazon.

"
"

  So, I had purchased this set on 8/sep with much excitement but i had never expected that i have to face soo much drama for replacement / refund.phone started heating after every 2minutes use, when you visit om replacement option,  where thr actually no any replacement option , thr is option to download the app or talk to techincan , you have to explain your problem twice- thrice to them...thn they will ask you to download the app..then they will check temperature then they will arrange a techincan visit at your place , after so much of struggle. Then you will will get replacement then again same problem (may persist or maynot be)  In my case i am not satisfied with product i thought it is of Samsung brand so i cn go for it but now there is no any exchange police😔😔 but (Kamchalu type model)!!  you can invest 2k more and can go for a good model...2star...ps- such a long review but it is truthhhhhhh, now i will think twice before purchasing from amazon!!

"
"

  Product is fine but has limitations to function only in india. And it doesn't work well for my Mom cause she keeps travelling abroad frequently.Why wasn't I informed by Amazon about the restrictions that the phone can't function in other countries? There are other countries in the world too where they've been using mobile phones even before India.Misleading the customers shouldn't be the priority of Amazon

"
"

  Amazon upi, amazon scan & Pay, amazon  money  load not working on this phone  it gets version  not updated  error in play sore it shows open it called to amazon  & Samsung  customer  care but amazon says phone version  does not support  its run on anderoid lite go version so may have problem  in lite version samsung  told to visit  their service  center so dont know it will work on anderoid  10 lite go version ?

"

  I've been using this as my Official mobile... Apps like WhatsApp, fb lite, cricbuzz, playmusic, YouTube, Microsoft Teams, Outlook, Intelligent Hub, Hrms, Bankings apps like YONO, Paytm, gpayWith these apps it's running smoothly...A bit of lag, but for this proce range acceptable..Pros:Decent Camera at this proce rangeAverage specs at this price rangeSamsung Brand ValueAndroid Go OSSamsung skin over this OS was decentCons:Below average battery life, anyhow it lasts for a dayPathetic charging speed (more than 4hrs)Charger provided with box is 5V 1A at least 10W charger they could have added

  The mobile Samsung Galaxy M01 Core (Black, 1GB RAM, 16GB , received could not be charged, after battery was low.  Now new phone battery uncharged what do I do, Amazon delivered defective product. This is worst phone

"
"

  Loved this peice best phone at this price. Samsung always worth every penny. Needed phone for onliy class of my son and this is best.

"
"

  I bought this for my mother as her 1st android mobile and she is very happy with it. User friendly and good for 1st time users.

"
"

  It is not at all satisfying because it is not getting charged by any other android charger other than the given one and the process is soo slow.I literally expected something but the result was different soo please dont buy this product at all.It will never match your expectations. The normal android phone is better than this.But i am happy for few things the battery does not drain too fast and the volume is good,but we cant play animated games like pubg or free fire because it strucks in between.At last I am not satisfies with the product even the design is ordinary very normal one but It is better than in images😂 and the camera is not like they have shown. same problem if we move the phone it gets strucked.The quality of camera is not at all good but it is okay for old people and for normal users like who use it only for phone calls and messages

"
"

  Product  is best and  cheapest. I am using  this  mobile  phone,  phone  performance is very  good in this  price . Camera quality is  also  good. So totally mobile  phone is very cheapest.

"
"

  It's been only 9 day since i got the phone and it's already showing problem the phone is not charging and it's dead. The image quality is not matching what you r showing in tha detail. The display is also not good. Anywez i can bare that but the main problem is the phone is not taking charge. And it's dead

"
"

  Honestly I don't like the product. The screen response is very slow ,I can't even pick up the phone quickly. Battery life is very less and requires almost 3hrs for full charge. Overall it is very disappointing.  Only good thing is it supports android 10 that also does not have some features less. This was not expected from samsung, though it is a budget phone.

"
"

  Worst product never ever try to take this product... All of sudden stopped charging and not working after 12 days.... Need to replace this but no source to do... Please don't buy this kind of worst products when ppl are unable to spend much money... Try to take good reviews mobiles

"
"

   Purchased on 26 sep 20, This is second occassion my phone auto switched off and screen is dead. Previously it was so for 3 days, on fourth day it returned to life when tried swich repeatedly. To day the screen gone dead despite of good charge in the battery. Pl look into the matter as complaint window does not work in my panasonic eluga x.Pl help.

"
"

  Don't buy this mobile, it's totally waste.. Camera quality is too bad and battery backup also very slow it takes more than 3 hours to charge fully.. And battery was drained point by point suddenly in the normal usage also.. And heating issue also in this mobile.. Better go with any other brands in this budget..*Return procedure to get refund*In Amazon they say it's a electronic product we can't provide you a refund only we can able to provide you replacement only.. Just accept that they'll send one mobile service field agent to check whether the product is defective or not.. After they approved, they replace the old one and provide you a new one in that same product..In that replacement product also surely you'll face some defects so just ask for an refund directly through the options showing in that order page.. They immediately approve that and within few working days they'll provide you a refund..These kind of electronic product's first time they'll provide replacement offer and second time they'll provide direct refund..

"
"

  I foud it lightweight, good in appereance,Sound quality is very good, battery backup is too good , audio recording feature not found(exists or not) and phone getting heatup during youtube live streaming(may be may bedue to weak signal)Overall it is quality handset

"
"

  Note : for those whose mobile got switched off , press power and volume button at same time . It will be on in safe mode. Then you may restart or can work as it is . ...I purchased for my mother. Because it is small and lightweighted i thought it is perfect for my mom. Previously she had Redmi 7A but because i dont want to have any chinese phone in my home , i decided to exchange with this.Pros : So cute , so small , light weighted , less price , good speed ....cons: Battery , Battery , Battery... My 3 year old J7 2016 (3300Mah )(large screen than this) gave 1 and half day backup and this phone not give backup of single day . MY mother just use 3 to 4 hr daily . Then also My Mom got frustated . She even asked me to give her old phone back. Amazon was not returning this. I gave threat to go to consumer forum and after 2nd visit of technician they understood my problem and gave my money. I really go to consumer court if Amazon wouldnt have accepted my return . Its not about amount but the pain of feeling cheated daily which cause anger. After that i ordered for M21 and contrary to my expectation my mom was happy with large screen . M21 is Awesome . The Best thing about samsung phone is their UI . I love it . So if u r budget conscious then may consider other option but dont go for samsung in less than 10k phone. But I feel that samsung will improve its battery . But i request everyone to not buy chinese product.

"
"

  Bought this product for my aunt. She hardly use any of the app. only for phone calls  sometimes watz app video. Battery back up is not even coming half a day and charge time taking 2:30 hrs with the original charger given by samsung.  I bought this product just want to avoid ReadMI products. But not i am regretting that i purchased this mobile. Samsung needs to atlease match redmi phone quality which are available in this price range

"
"

  Mobile heated up after few mins of usage. Touch is not highly responsive. Mobile vibrates while playing audio in speaker at near full sound. Hangs few times. Display & call quality is good. Poor build quality. Product failed to meet satisfaction.

  I bought two phones M01 core , One is working fine(Shipped from Noida) for two weeks , need to see how long it goes, for the second one (Shipped from WB ) it gets switched off automatically , 1st time when it has 35% battery , need to wait until its battery drains completely, then it got charged and after two days switched off again at 75% charging, Requested for return.I see same complaint by many users .

  Phone was running fine for the first few days. Then suddenly out of the blue it got switched off and gives no response what so ever. I have applied for a return. Thus, not recommended at all.P.S. will post an update on the return after the process is completed.Edit: after filing return a technician was appointed, who cancelled for no reason. Again it was rescheduled who visited and told that a lot of customers are complaining the same and yet the product is available. Anyway he diagnosed the problem as a manufactur detect. I got a replacement instead of a refund. The new phone arrived and came with the same problems. I agian filed for a return and this time got a refund. But I suppose I was lucky as I would have to run to the manufacturer of the problem would have occurred out of return window. A huge no for samsung products!

  My maid brought this for her daughter so she can use it for her online education. It won’t charge and stopped working after a month of use. Also it gets overheated. I saw positive reviews when I bought it.  Anyway it has warranty so will have to go to Samsung service Center and see.

"
"

  Got this for my dad, and writing a review after a months use. Great display and no bloatware. Go for the 32gb variant, value for money !

  Phone is very slow, It gets switched off suddenly. Made complaint to Amazon over the phone . I asked for return . They didn’t agree. Brand new phone with such issue. This is not for I paid this much amount . Please don’t buy . It is waste of money . I downloaded only one app, which is YouTube. I bought it because this is Samsung. I didn’t know Samsung make such bad quality product.

"
"

  Don't buy it from Amazon. They don't help customer and they deliver defective product. I am not able to charge the mobile, they infrom me to consult brand center for repair, as your return window had been closed. Initially I hadn't use the product for a week as I had to gift the product to someone else. So if u think to buy this buy it from samsung store, don't buy it from Amazon.

"
"

  I have received this on 16august 2020....now it's only 6th sep....my phone has become dead and is not charging up.....wasting of money....amazon should help us as this is a defective product and many people are facing same issues....

"
"

  This review is solely for the seller who sold a faulty phone with a huge black spot on the screen. It is so obvious that proper quality check was not done before delivery. This can happen only in case of a used phond being sold as new. Will have to think twice before ordering costly things online, especially in Amazon because as the eshop, Amazon also cannot deny responsibility for this. The headache that I am going through now to return the faulty item is a complete nightmare.

"
"

  Bought this mobile for kids study purpose. They just downloaded the whatsapp and google classroom. And after keeping it on charge for half an hour mobile is not starting at all. Not expect this kind of quality from Samsung.

"
"

  Waste product and process of Amazon. I bought it for a purpose n i found out after the product delivery that it doesnt meet my requirement now I'm dont have an option to return n buy a diff model also. Such a disappointing experience. Awful

"
"

  After 5 Days of usagePros1. 2 Days battery life2. Smooth performance3. Android go edition runs smooth4. Purchased 1 gb ram varient but runs very smooth no legs.Cons1. Charging time is of 3 hrs2. If u installed so many apps it will start legging (i have installed only whatsapp)I have gifted.this phone to my mother she is very happy with the performance.In this price segment this phone is superb.

"
"

  Hey guys ,don't purchase this moblie at all.it is not worthy to use, simply waste of your money.I purchased this phn for my mother.It claims to give 1 yr warranty , but the phn is dead within 1 1/2 months,Very awful product.I chatted with customer service abt whether this item can be replaced or not as it comes within warranty period ,but there is no coperative response as they keep on recycling u on same page.They don't even bother to call even after filing complaint.Simply waste product  , meant to throw in trash...I highly suggest don't buy ...

"
"

  M01 core is very light and handy...value for money...a little bit heat is there...but in this cost ..it is awesome...

"
"

  Mobile is a basic model smartphone .It wil be only suitable for calls , whatap ,youtube and some other basic apps....Phone got over heated and dead by using continuos youtube and games since it's have 1gb ram..After visiting service center phone came live again...If u r a basic user as old age people it is best one or else go for 2gb ram version

"
"

  I am very unsatisfied from this seller and Amazon.. I received a defective product.. It did not switch on. I made a replacement request. And the delivery agent insisted on checking the IMEI number from the phone. I reported the issue to Amazon but every time the agent arrived I would face the same issue. I am one of the loyal customers of Amazon and I did not expect such a behaviour from them. I hope this time it gets replaced.

"
"

  Samsung mobile ok processors is OLD in 2017 processorThse phone is old and use to very slow battery life and heating some timesDont by thsephone

"
"

  Unlike other Samsung handsets that I’ve been using for years, this phone is of a really poor quality. It heated up, the charger heated up too, and then the phone switched off and wouldn’t start. All within hours of opening the new handset. But Amazon has been wonderful with their delivery, repair and return service, so thankfully my refund has been initiated. I will not recommend this model to anyone.

"
"

  Its not the value for money. No C-type charger so charging is very very slow it takes 4-5hrs for 100% battery. Just putting 1000 bucks extra I should get Redmi which is better in this segment.

"
"

  I had purchased  this phone when there was big movement  against  chaines products.  I am facing several issues :1. Battery life not good2. Handset gets heated on nominal uses3. now after months uses phone gets switched off on few minutes talk.conclusion : don't waste your hard earned money in these political or corporate propoganda  like ban against chaines  product

"
"

  Superb for secondary usageBasic smartphone

"
"

  Battery backup, screen quality and camera quality is too poor. Didn't want to buy Chinese, so bought this expecting a good phone. But turned out to be so outdated quality that I felt like I'm living in 2015. Phones released during 2015 had better camera than this phone. Disappointing product from  Samsung when their competitors are offering much better quality phone at same or lower price.

"
"

  The phone stopped working after 15 days and when we took to Samsung repair they charged us money to get it fixed even though under warranty

"
"

  The phone doesn't switch On at all after the initial charging was done. Trying to get a replacement and guidelines by Amazon is not helpful at all. When the phone doesn't work, there is no way we can download an app. On chat with Amazon technician, they said only replacement is possible and that it will be done by 3rd October. .I had approached by 29th September and was told only replacement is possible and that it will be replaced on 3rd October which I am yet to receive. Should I next take this to consumer court??

"
"

  My younger sis using this phone since days and found it isnt a bad deal at all at this cost. Display ,touch response is great baterry life is just ok as prr her use and camera quality is better. My sis is happy to have made in india phone. Must buy phone at this price point. Cheerzz

"
"

  The phone get a switched off within a day of purchase and dont work ever after. I went for the brand name. But I feel I should have gone for MI phone instead of this. This was a gift for my mother.  Such a disappointment and embarrassment. Now Amazon is not very helpful in returning. They need picture of the phone. I think they assumed people has spare phones lying around to take photo for their defective product. Amazon please act as per your brand name at least.

"
"

  Bought this phone for my father (who used to be a feature phone user till now).. A great phone for feature-to-android phone switchers! A value for money phone. It completely satisfy all the basic requirements of a smartphone! GO FOR IT!

"
"

  Device received yesterday afternoon and it was charged to 95’%. Yesterday night it got switched off automatically and not working. Reported this to Amazon customer technical service. They have stated that no stock is available to give replacement immediately and to wait for 48 hrs. Bad experience!!!

"
"

  I buy this for my father basic use. It's nice product, you can't except more in this price. Very light weight, looks good, only I feel according to 2GB RAM it's bit slow. Rest all good. Just last I want to tell there is no Fingerprint lock, face lock, no type C charging, no fast charging. Take 4 hours to complete full charging from 10% to 100%.

"
"

  Don't buy this phone...this is the worst phone i have ever used. I have faced a issue of not charging ( Mobile got switched off and not charging ) after 3 working days. i asked to  amazon customer care  for refund....but there is no refund for this product they replaced the mobile. While using the new phone exactly after 3 days again the same problem began. Even after having the 80% of charging mobile got switched off and not started and not showing any type of indication while charging.

"
"

  For senior citizens this smart phone is sufficient, who don't want unnecessary apps, games etc.With minimal apps for banking and WhatsApp and some more apps this Samsung mobile is more than enough.

"
"

  nothing to dislike  good phone

"
"

  Very nice product..... I, m very happy samsungm01core. Many beautiful products at low prices. The set is very beautiful and quick.  Personally, I like it very much.❤️😍💐👌🎵

"
"

  If you are looking for a smartphone nearby 5000 Rs than this is the One, The samsung Galaxy M01 core. All the features are more than the value of smartphone itself. With 3000 mah battery you can go all day without any extra charge needed. Camera quality also awesome within this range.  Also the design of phone is stunning. Cant even imagin such a low budget smartphone with all this beautiful features. Definitely Samsung alway makes its customers happy. All samsung products are No.1

"
"

  I bought it for my Mom.Pros:- Good Hardware can withstand for years and also looking good- Pretty good camera for the price Rs.5500.- Good loudspeaker.Cons :- Charging dead slow really dead slow.- Lots of bloatware apps , i recommended you to uninstall the bloatware apps the moment you switched on the handset and if not then atleast disable the apps.- Heats a lot even for minimum usage .

"
"

  Its a good product within its price range  battery life is good can standby for 4days with minimalistic usage camera is not that clear but it serves its purpose. Though it consists of 1gb ram it never hanged for me(i never did gaming on it). Overall its a good product at 5.5k range

"
"

  After ysing it for 2 weeksPros:Camera quality is good for this price range.Screen quality is also good.4G Download & Upload speed is fine.Battery back is ok.Cons:It is Android Go version.The mobile heats up quickly after 5 mins of video chat in whats app in a good network area.The system is slow inspite of having 2 Gb Ram in Androis Go version.

"
"

  This smartphone from Samsung is really good for doin' basic task for every day use, and that's the important thing for which I bought this, it was just for RS.5999. For those who want a device just for doing simple basic task can have this. But the only disappointment for me with the device is, they could have optimized the UI just a lil' bit and the battery life is not that good, also for those who dont know this device is powered by Android 10 GO edition.

"
"

  Worst mobile ever, worst service by amazon, no return no replacement, mobile is over heated while using time, and talking time, bt amazon was not ready to replacement, they told me above 40 degree heated then only replaced, very disappointed, I promptly told u after 6 days using it's not a mobile it's a iron box dont go this,I was replaced it, bt sadly second mobile also lot of heated while calling time, n using time, worst experience wd Amazon n Samsung

"
"

  I bought it for my father.The battery life sucks.Requires 2.5 to 3 hrs to charge and a very little time to discharge,Delivered on 29 Oct 2020I tried to return the product after 2 days use , in the return option it was written eligible through 6 Oct .Then I opened the app and there was no return option available.Then I called the customer care , they said they can't do anything...The customer service is too bad ,

"
"

  If you want a good performance never buy this phone...This is not for a college going student...this phone has 3000 mah battery but it feels like it has 1900 mah battery...it takes almost 5 hours to full charge from 0 to 100% ...this mobile is best for elders like dad and mom who has basic knowledge about smartphone...i never suggest you to buy this phone...

"
"

  power button is not working, i ordered this to gift someone, poor response from amazon, tried to apply return request, unable to proceed... poor response from amazon, when i opened the box, phone was in android recovery mode due to power button issue... very much disappointed...

"
"

  Excelent phone for my father in law. I have bought this phone for my father in law as he needs phone which should be small and handy and very lightweight in hand and Major issue with this phone is slow charging and quick battery draining. and one more thing I don’t like in this phone that is when u continues use it for 25-30 minutes it start getting heat which is not good.

"
"

  An perfect phone for someone with moderate budjet and basic needs on a phone.A quality product from Samsung.Display and camera quality are good for the price range.

"
"

  Advantages of this mobile1. No blot applications2. Battery life 37 hours but battery saver mode enhanced up to 125 hours.3. We can transfer installed applications to SD cards4. We can install Candy crush type gameWe can't expect best photo from Rs. 5500-6500 range mobile camera

"
"

  It's a very nice phone in this price only the problem is of the battery it charges slowly.

"
"

  After one month of usage I cannot found any big problem. But I cannot assure anybody that it will last long eventhough I hope it will. One small disadvantage which I found was that, if you use mobile data the battery will drain somewhat quickly. Overall it is a good budget phone.

"
"

  No product support and replacement window is working. I purchased M31 and M01 phone in same week but both were defective. Not recommended Samsung to buy at all.15th September, I received this phone in packed condition an on 23rd sep, I am unable to switch on the set. I have gifted this set to my grand father. Till 22nd night, phone was working fine and on 23rd morning  I am unable to switch on.

"
"

  Unbelievably pathetic product as I ordered one and the phone kept hanging and the charging was not happening so i requested for a change of the phone and today i got a new phone delivered and the same problem is still there as its been more than one hour of charging the phone and the phone is charged by only 15 percent , i will not recommend this product even if this is a real or fake product from samaung I don’t know

"
"

  Very much dissatisfied with product.And moreover if you have still thousands of problems, Amazon will give thousands reasons to prove that they will not refund the money. They will replace everytime and you will end up getting the same product again and again.And Samsung making such products is really disheartening.From a lover of Samsung brand.

"
"

  Value for money is not up to the mark as if you pay just ₹1900 more, you can get way more features like better performance, camera, screen quality & size, battery life with the M01.But for a beginner who uses only Facebook , Whatsapp, YouTube... this would be the one.Sound is good for the price! Camera is the worst but gets the job done.

"
"

  I love it, low price. Only issue is it takes time to charge but its good for whole day with full charge.

"
"

  Worst model. Mobile dead after using for 25 minutes after full 1 charge cycle. Please don't buy this mobile, go for m01 but not this one. But, I got full refund from amazon. Good service from amazon customer care.

"
"

  I bought this phone for my wife and she finds it very compact and convenient to use. The battery has long life so frequent charging is not require. Camera quality is good for normal photography. Screen quality is really very good. You can enjoy watching  videos with amazing quality. Really value for money.

"
"

  The keyboard is very small. It has Samsung keyboard as well as Google keyboard both are too small. Even after increasing the size didn't help. Need to install third party app. The UI is the worst thing with this phone. The icon size is too small for our naked eyes to see clearly. Often i end up clicking another app while i suppose to click another. Also there is no option to increase the size

"
"

  Waste of money and timeLow qualityNo return option availableBad experience from Amazon. No proper response and return policy

"
"

  since beginning it is giving problem. In between the call message is prompted "" NO SIM"" and get disconnected. Been calling samsung but no solution to the problem. Will not recommend it to anyone.

"
"

  Amazing and affordable

"
"

  Unluckily the Samsung Galaxy M01 started overheating and went off after 5 or 6 days of working fine. But Amazon provided a Technician support and again it worked fine for next 3 days. Then episode of switching off happened again and Amazon promised another Technician support.Looking for a better closure of the issue. Will share the feedback here post completion.

"
"

  Best for daily use and not so heavy work...Quad core with 2GB ram is fine...*Not a heavy gaming device!Camera n screen resolution are best for this handset!Applications are optimized and some are of lite version... which is why device don't lag...Samsung is brand name for genuineness!Amazon deals are fabulous...!

"
"

  This phone has so many issue since the first day I bought this.It keeps getting switched off on its own and their is no support from amazon technicians as they give false output and closed the case multiple times. Totally disappointed with this product and was hoping for some better services from Samsung and amazon but seems I have to keep going to their center for its repair.

"
"

  I purchased the phone for my father. This is a budget friendly phone for sure. In my case the usage is minimum as my father is using the same. By this time I didn't find any big cons for the phone. The battery life is decent and the camera is ok. As per my experience this is a best phone for elders in the family and also to people who has a minimal usage of a smart phone.

"
"

  Quite impressive look good finishing or light weight allover goid quality with new features .

"
"

  Bought today, Phone has many issues :Performance is very slow, hanging issues, heating is another one.The screen size very small, the display is not good. Sound and cameras are the worst part of this phone.Is there anything else left on any phone? Yes, battery. I don't know about battery backup but I am sure. It will not be great.

"
"

  Very bad product. Please don't buy. Heating problem is normal. Charger also have heating problem. Wast of money.  Purchased for my mother and now wasting my time and money on this. Pethetic

"
"

  Good phone for beginners. I bought it as gift for my grandmother and she's starting to learn the android phone with this one. Nice average built phone for below moderate users.

"
"

  Waste of hard earned money. Poor service by AmazonTotally useless mobile . Poor battery performance and hangs a lot . When I called to customer care to return it they were asking to install app the phone was not even working to install it and they denied the return lost my money on totally crap product

"
"

  Phone getting Heated in all time ... batter life was worst thing ... what the specification given by amazon is not there ... i am not at all satisfied ... No Refund also available ... WASTE OF MONEY

"
"

  Battery life is less, camera clearty is normal and portait mode is absent, call hearing is not audible we have to open speaker, do not support high quality  videos, old model and less screen for usage and processor is very less and slow

"
"

  I liked it because i needed small anroid phone for calls only and net

"
"

  BATTERY LIFE GOODCAMERA QUALITY OKAY FOR SELFIESOVERALL ITS A NICE BUYBUT ITS NOT MEANT FOR APP HOARDERS OR PUBG PLAYING AS IT HEATS UP THE PHONE.FOR AVERAGE USE SUCH AS ONLINE CLASS MEETING STUDIES AND LIGHT APPS AND GAMES ITS AMONG THE BEST PURCHASES AND THIS REVIEW IS AFTER 8 DAYS OF PURCHASE OF PRODUCTIF ANY ISSUE I WILL UPDATE.

"
"

  After 1month of usage:Battery suddenly drops from 100% to 40%, heating issue while in call. I will Not recommend this phone. Just Go for midrange mobiles above 8000rs.

"
"

  Product is very bad because it has very short battery backup. Charging time is very  long. It takes longer than usual. Camera quality is very poor. Amazon service is very bad after complaint about product they didn't solve problem.

"
"

  I use this phone as basic. But this phone hang at every touch.Camera quality is clear.Value of money is also cheap.Battery don't last for full day. Without use last for 10 hrs. Using Internet last for 4hrs only.

"
"

  I am getting over heat from this mobile. Want to return but no return option was there . I have raise a complaint to technician he has give some procedure to reset . After doing the reset also experienced the same heat issue .

"
"

  After using 2 days, phone was suddenly  gone off Inspite of half battery percentage..Went to samusung  service they made it on  later again using 2 days it was again gone sudden off,First time bad experience from SAMSUNG products..Don't go for this Miseries cheap phone..It needed to be replaced as defect device manufactured.

"
"

  Bought this phone 2 weeks back. But facing a lot of problems. I was talking on the phone with 60% charge and suddenly the phone went blank and we couldn't switch it on for 2 days.Yesterday I was on call and after talking I couldn't cut the call. After trying a lot I switched it off and on againDisappointed

"
"

  The return period is over yesterday, where to contact. Then I contacted the Samsung customer care. They told to went for service center. The problem is software update. Without software update my phone not turned on. After the service person updated the software the phone got ON ed. This one is new for me, without update the phone not switch on.

"
"

  I have received the phone but didn’t work after 5 th day, didn’t start up. I believe Samsung is very good brand it should not go useless in few days. Tried to return but it’s hard process through amazon.in especially when you are out of country and ordering for parents or relatives through India account. I will not recommend anyone to buy this.

"
"

  Not sure why Phone is over heating from the first use itself. Earlier I have used 1GB ram phones. However, I feel this phone is little slow. Camera and screen quality is Good. Only issue is heating and slow.

"
"

  Yesterday  i received  my phone  by Amazon  i just stated used it today  while using  internat phone  getting  hotter... i called  Amazon  care they said download  blancoo app and can find temperature ..i fear mobile  can blast with in 7 days i will return it if problems  continue..thanks

"
"

  This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand manufactured in India.Long lasting battery life (3000mAh)Phone has 8 megapixel rear camera and has a 5 megapixel camera for selfieHandy phone with a Display size 5.3Overall worth for the money, without second taught you can go for this phone.

"
"

  This mobile is perfect for low budget buyers and also there are many interesting features which everyone absolutely like it. This mobile is price worthy.I am using this device for 2 weeks and it's running very smoothly but remember it's not for high quality games. Over all it's best mobile under Rs.10000

"
"

  Phone look is classy, battery backup a-one. camera front and back is average. there is big problem in hand set that is heating problem  while using without wifi or with wifi. that is big weakness of this phone.

"
"

  I purchased this phone but I didn't like,I talked to customer care for return but there is no any option for return,First time I got major drawback of Amazon if purchased mobile any how you have to use it either you like or not, Dump for me,Just I waste 6399 rupeese.Thanks for fast delivery...

"
"

  WORST QUALITY.WAS DEAD IN TWO WEEKS.I SUGGEST YOU SEARCH FOR BETTER CHEAPER CHINESE PRODUCTS THAN THIS SAMSUNG ENTRY LEVEL GARBAGE.

"
"

  Today I purchased Samsung M01 core easy hand comfortable ,slim nice lookBut  toch screen quality not satisfied left side top touch not working  properlyDear Samsung you please maintain your reputaion in your mobile platform because of big aduience with your side,dont lose your  single supporters from your side

"
"

  Compromises a lot on Battery, you can literally see each percentage gradually failing towards Zero! Overall a Good Package for someone looking for Basic Experience. Cameras are Good. Screen looks fabulous for the price point! Android Go version don't let you do a lot of things, and I mean it.

"
"

  Very fast  delivery from Amazon, Its Good looking phone for normal user and low price, Normal camera result and battery backup is not so good, Only one day for normal use. Overall good for routine use everyday, Don't expect much in this price. Thank you Samsung, Thank you Amazon.

"
"

  Just wow.....and I gifted to my mom ...she just loved it 😊tqq samsung❤️..not for education purpose just used to see YouTube videos and video calls for elder ones..battery life is good but camera quality is not bad but for my mom camera is not all useful ..she just watch news in phone.finally she loved it..u can buy to ur parents😊

"
"

  Bought this product on 16-09-2020 , after using 17 days the phone is not working, not start. return window has been closed. many times trying contact to customer  service. Got a single reply return and exchange window has been closed.please don't buy.

"
"

  It's brilliant. 100% value for money. Great battery life, awesome camera quality, and vibrant screen colours as seen in the image. The back panel is so beautiful and different than every other phone that you would feel bad to cover it up!Strong and sturdy as well, the M01 Core does it's job at the price it's tagged in.

"
"

  Poor quality no return performance is too bad

"
"

  It's horrible. Got switched off on its own just 4 days. Shocked after buying from Amazon. Horrible seller product. Have asked for a tech visit. Amazon it's our hard earned Mone kindly refund.

"
"

  waste product, not getting/picking battery charge... thinking to throw on sellers head for providing such bad quality handset

"
"

  Right choice for only general users.. battery life is perfect as this segment.. camera quality as this range is being best..

"
"

  Manufacturing defectNeed to replace

"
"

  Pathetic Heating issue SAMSUNG will become Next NOKIA I buyed SAMSUNG M01 Also same Heating Issue With Love with Amazon

"
"

  It has a bit heating issues but over all at this price it is a good dealBest for elderly people or people with less usage of cell phone

"
"

  Low cost less featureValue of price is satisfiedPhone recommend for people who want upgrade to smart phone from keypad phone with very less use-ageSound quality is lowTouch screen sense is okFrom internal gb for storage is occupied by pre-installed app 50% apps are useful from pre-installed

"
"

  This phone is not good. It is getting hot very quickly. Even after talking 10 minutes it will become very hot and the battery life is also not good. The phone will be switched off automatically after gei hot. Overall I am not satisfied with this. Total waste of money. So please don't buy this phone anyone.

"
"

  The delivered phone was not functioning Properly, frequently get switched off planning for replacement.The replaced one is in good condition and working good.Suitable for elders those who need a simple phone for calling and social medias.

"
"

  Within one day of use the phone randomly switched off. I tried to charge it and pressed the pwer key but there was no response. After a few tries i figured it out. This phone switches off randomly and can only be switched on by pressing volume key and power key simultaneously.

"
"

  I give zero start to this phone and also to amazon for not replacing this. Very disappointing, waste of money. Now I decided to didn't shop anymore from Amazon ..

"
"

  Totally waste of money..I purchased Samsung M01 core Mobile on 17 August 2020, today ( 17/9/2020) mobile is dead. mobile switched off automatically.Mobile is not working any other functions like format and Boot..So don't buy this product please. my money is wasted..😢

"
"

  I have gifted this Phone to Mr.Imran Ali Shamsi at Rampur -UP.He has received. He told me that it held up too much.Please advise someine to Contact Him on Tel- No-92590 64396  and resolve the matter.If Phone is defective, please arrange replacement.

"
"

  Worst product ever got. Mobile is not turning on now. I can’t able to return.

"
"

  Please do not buy this phone as its battery or some software is faulty right from the beginning. After not even a week's use a message comes up saying that the battery is overheating and then the phone gets switched off.

"
"

  Camera quality is nice in this budget and Battery life is good for normal user I don't recommend it to heavy users because Processor is normal and good in this price .Screen quality is TFT LCD which is nice ,Overall this is the best smartphone in this budget.

"
"

  Good phone in this price range.And it isn't made in China,so extra points for that.Like other reviewers have mentioned,this phone shuts down, in the first day,just force reboot it and it won't give any problems afterwards.

"
"

  In product description handset is available with phone is written but it is not there in product.Wrong Information is being provided by Amazon.

"
"

  Product is good but some software are not working as zoom app.... Cell has over heating issues while talking or watching videos or charging... Suggest not to get this mob if u ve another option

"
"

  Very poor battery phone is heating while using it for 5minutes poor performance poor quality Product please don't buy it waste of money and time

"
"

  Value for money can't say much but according to brand it can be a OKAY deal. Small size and dum processing speed. You can get better device at this price of any other brand. Samsung can do better

"
"

   Amazing mobile phone from the Samsung company which is available in very low price designed with features which can be easily accessed by anyone (older adults) this product is best for our parents. Thank you samsung for such a great product

"
"

  The product is damn too good. It offers a good display with a decent battery life. I actually bought it for regular usage and a little bit of gaming which it carries out quite well. I am very much satisfied with this product..Thank you SamsungYou nailed it..

"
"

  After one and half month it's batter charging stopped , when i connected to phone not  showing charging , when make phone switch off and then it's showing charging but some time not showing ,Bad product

"
"

  phone is poor performance...slow , screen touch also not good..better not to go for this option even of you have budget constraints.very disappointed and no help from Amzon..no replacement request accepted even phone issie reported withinh 5 days of arrival

"
"

  Do not buy, waste of money.Phone is heating, charging takes lot of time, network loses automalically , go for a better one ""Samsung"" losses it's quality here !

  I bought this mobile for my daughter online class on zoom.But this mobile is not supporting zoom ap.Incoming voice problem.I found this problem today and make up my mind to return this mobile but I found that amazon had closed the return door today.bad luck.no use of new mobile.

"
"

  I am very happy that i bought a new phone in my budget .About this phone . The phone is very good looking and very smooth .Little bit lagging problem otherwise its all okThanksParshant kumar

"
"

  Worst product after using one hour, the phone got dead and in the beginning unable to read the sim. Simply disappointed. If the same issue raised by so many customers, why amazon selling such defective products, without resolving such issues.

"
"

"
"

"
"

"
"

  To be honest.. This phone is meant for parents. I got this for my granny she was happy it's good for people who don't use phone much. It will not be durable for teenagers and people who live on phone a lot.... But a samsung phone @5k is too good.... Received on time... Thank you Amazon.

"
"

  The battery life is not good and the time taken to charge battery is very high. Moreover phone is getting turned off again and again and do not switch on easily.

"
"

   Last night i kept my phone for charging... But then today when I woke up i was trying to switch it on... But it was not switching on... Can you please help me with this problem as soon as possible... Please can u help me with this problem

"
"

  My dear friends don't buy it. It's cheating.. Mobile hanging is very often cannot call also.. Better buy a cheap less than 1k... Don't go for it.. Anyhow I returned it with lot of fight with amazon..

"
"

  I ordered this phone, but just one month only working, suddenly ph is not working . I don’t know what is that problem.

"
"

  I just purchased the phone on amazon .in a few weeks ago , but unfortunately it suddenly turned off and won't start again. After charging it for several times its just not working . I  bought the phone for Rs. 4999/  and the amount of money is really precious to me .

"
"

  After long time very compact smart device by samsungEntry level mobile user best buying chooseCamera averageBattery life more than one day usageScreen quality above average

"
"

  Processor is so slow that does not even support zoom without lag.  Front camera video quality very dark in normal light room.  Battery drains very fast in light uses. Colour reproduction of the screen is not so good. At the price point of 6499 this product is wastage of money.

"
"

  I think this phone is perfect for general useIt has good battery backup,Comes out of the box Android 10 based on Android one program no bloatware and very smooth UI.The thickness of the phone is very good no need of back cover because of the texture.

"
"

  if you want to gift a phone to ur parents then this is best phone. Battery stays i think easily for a day without heavy usage. but u cant play high end games like cod or pubg in this. and if you are going to buy it then buy the 2gb variant

"
"

  Slow interface and all apps are on go version which does not work to its full potential.

"
"

  Samsung M01 over all a good and budget phone by its looks and price but there are a big problem in phone and It  becomes to hot during call and use of internet over cellular network . I hope this will not be in all future handsets and company will take acre this problem.

"
"

  Product was delivered before the time. Though simple and small in size it has a smooth touch with all basic facility like any other smart phone.

"
"

  Screen quality very impressive,Light weight and handy,Looks very Cute,Sound quality is great,Only RAM is less, but the price also matters.Overall a good deal and nice product from Samsung. 👍

"
"

  Phone is awesome till now..battery is also good, camera quality is also good overall in this range samsung delivered good phone . Best part is that, it is very light in weight ,very handy and all apps are run very smooth.

"
"

  Galaxy M01 core is really best smartphone for normal use...Display quality is superb... And battery backup is also good...Overall Product is very good in everything

"
"

  Phone is good with nice display, battery and response time. But just forget that it comes with a camera. Camera is not usable for a photo or a video.

"
"

  Serves best for basic users,I took for my mother who only uses whatsapp and calls only

"
"

  It's a small phone but but feels jus like an iphone. It's really cool and compact. Perfect budget phone. The selfie camera isnt great but back camera is awesome.

"
"

  I bought Samsung M01 core on 15'th aug and today  ( within a week ) it has stopped working. Now I am struggling to find service center and reach out to Sansung

"
"

  THANK YOU SAMSUNG MOBILE LTDI AM BUYING M01 THIS PHONE IS VERY GOOD GIFT FOR MY WIFE COMFORT MOBILE GOOD FOR GIRLS👩‍⚕️👩‍🎓👩‍⚖️ THANK YOU AMAZON

"
"

  After using this mobile for just one week I came to the conclusion that this mobile is a failure model since it has a high amount of heating problems during charging and very poor battery. I returned this product within a week and switched to another mobile.

"
"

  This phone is not performing as expected. Phone is hang most of the times and getting warm very often.I have a very bad feedback on this phone as it stop responding with in 15 days of use. This is not expected from Samsung.

"
"

  Disatisfied with the product. The sound and mic are not good. Amazom has replaced a product but it is with same issue. Hence returning for refund. I will.go with different brand now. Not satisfied with samsung now.  They are cmning dwn on quality

"
"

"
"

  Good Mobile.

"
"

  Don't ever buy this phone, within 5 days my Phone is dead! Performance was lagging since 2nd day, battery life is very poor, takes a lot if time to charge.Now I have requested to return but they aren't even considering my request!

"
"

  Must buy according to price.Very smooth and friendly user interface.Camera quality is very good.Samsung is a very reputed and good brand providing top features in this price segment.

"
"

  I got this Samsung Galaxy M01 Core on September 05th and this mobile is not been working from September 14th onwards without having any damages. It's automatically switched off and we we were tried to switched on but not able to do, so please help me.

"
"

  After one day the phone has become dead. Even after full charge it is not working. Please let me know how to return.

"
"

  Battery is worst part of this phone.At this price nothing much expected.Too much lag or hanging freezing alote.Just use it for calling and WhatsApp only.

"
"

  Cheap qualityI love Samsung but found cheap qualityThe cable wire used for changer along with sim tray wrose Chinese itemMade mistake

"
"

  My humble request don't buy this product. Completely 3rd class product and not even worth of 1000 Rs. In all aspects thus model got failed . Don't fall into the trap by seeing the price and AMAZON don't even provide return option for this product.

"
"

  Third class product I cant keep it even for free and now amazon is making foolosh by ssying to dounload fake aaps in witch costumers had maken comments that this is fake

"
"

  Delivered 15.8.2020. The phone just stops working  every  2-3 days and needs to be taken to Samsung dealer. It’s absolutely useless. While charging it gets very heated.

"
"

  This is good for 2nd phone look wise good, average battery life & camera quality, full value of money, services of Amazon is good delived in time

"
"

  Return window is closed and phone stop working in 15days..... please don't buy this phone

"
"

  Phone is good , rear camera good,front camera average, battery life good, display size in length good but width narrow ,price good , weight perfect, charging late,But one problem delivery is lateI received phone after due date....

"
"

  Pathetic Service by amazon. Providing defective piece with no option to exchange it for a better model.

"
"

  tHIS IS REALLY SURPRISING THAT THE PHONE IS DEAD AFTER USING 15 DAYS.

"
"

  It's really value for money and light weight.  I have purchased both Samsung Galaxy M01 Core 1GB and Samsung Galaxy M01 Core 2GB .

"
"

  Good product but i given 4star because size is too small ....

"
"

  This brand new mobile after inserting the SIM CARD and started downloading the apps it worked for just five minutes and screen got switched off and is not getting on from then on. It is the worst product that I have bought in Amazon.

"
"

  Product is fine enough to use but  more expected from samsung price is under 5500 improve your charger it's take 6..7hrs to charge full

"
"

  Would like to thank the Amazon Delivery team for the quicker Delivery.It's a Good Product to use and user-friendly with basic features.Recommended for Secondary phone or Minimal usage Smartphone.

"
"

  It heats up very quickly and stops running..I was return the product but this product return policy it's not available ... I hated Amazon .. so cheap Amazon company .. it's company terms and conditions it's totally lie.. .

"
"

  its good n value fr money n more over brands says everything .me n my whole family using samsung n nw my charity hv donated this phone to a girl ......she too like it ....

"
"

  Thanka Samsung and Amazon for providing a phone affordable to my pocket that enables my wife to help kida in their  online study. Thanks Samsumg once again to help my family in undisturbed learning.Thanks !!!!!!

"
"

  Totally disappointed in Amazon.After reading other people's reviews, I came to know many customers have received defective phones and are struggling for replacement.Not expecting this for 'Amazon fulfilled' product.

"
"

  Please don’t buy this phone. Very slow. Poor audio quality. Poor battery life. It’s just only 11 days since I bought it.

"
"

  1. Good product.2. Price is justified but mobile is of small size with less features.3. Good mobile for voice, video and data communication.4. Camera is average.5. Battery backup is also good.

"
"

  i dont know what is the problem with this mobile. after two weeks of useage, its not working now. its not evening turning on. China mobiles would work longer than this.

"
"

  I have used many Samsung mobiles. I find them user friendly. Featues are good in Samsung Galaxy M01 Core.  Only problem with Samsung mobile is it has too many inbuild software.

"
"

  Weak processor. Weak camera. Average battery life. I bought for 6499 and after 10 days Amazon was selling it for 5999. Phone hangs while doing daily work. It gives ok type user experience only.

"
"

  Phone is getting heated within 5 min of uses, Screen was very sluggish... While speaking over phone won't able to hold phone... Battery will drain like 5 years old phone...

"
"

  Decent phone ideal for those who switch from feature phone to smart phone or your parents. M not saying that, everything is top notch features in this phone but still brand name and the price segment is worthy to buying.

"
"

  Mobile is automatically dead while using and not came up even after charging. Very poor battery backup not even 2hr with playing and one day standby.Camera quality is too bad.Don't buy this mobile.

"
"

  Light weight, beautiful appearance that makes you fall for it, and of course value for money.

"
"

  This phone is quite sleek n compact. Its got good screen quality n picture clarity. Battery life is also too good for the price range. This is the best phone in market with a budget of 5k.

"
"

  Budget friendlyIt's a middle class choice

"
"

  luckily Phone is good , but package is opened before delivery. Without checking I had paid money to the delivery person. Please instruct the delivery persons to not to tamper the packing etc., Charger is very delicate.

"
"

  If you are looking for a alternative phone or to gift to your parents This one is really good. Coz as u all know less RAM and smaller size is enough and good for older people and to use as a temporary or alternatively

"
"

  Just OK Product, Samsung should reduce the pricing as compared to other Chinese phones. In that cost, Chinese phones offer premium service while Samsung doesn't

"
"

  RAM SPEEED DULL,CAMERA LIKE 5MP, CHARGING TIME 4 HRS,BACKUP OK.AFTER USING 4 DAYS POWER OFF AND NOT TURNING ON CUSTOMER CARE SAYING WAIT 7 DAYS FOR TECHNICIAN TO CONFIRM DEFECTIVE PIECE.*******DONT BUY*********

"
"

  Use product deliver to me.opne box in use the handset after sell

"
"

  Great value for money phone;pros:>Battery backup is awesome>has dark mode.>2GB ram and 32 GB storage with additional sd card slotCons:>taking lot of time to charge

"
"

  After one week of use , the product went dead and not able to restart. Unfortunately the return window is closed. So we son't know what to do with this faulty product.

"
"

  very quick delivery, phone is average built quality, performance is ok, but no Samsung special features in this phone, house peoples gift this phone, camera is average, battery medium average, screen look nice👍👍👍

"
"

  The mobile is very light weight. Although the phone is good.But it has a problem of OVER HEATING. You don not make a video call over 10 minute.  After 20 to 30 minutes use it runs slow.

"
"

  Don't buy this .waste of money ...over heating and hang problem ...no return no replace ...dont buy from this seller

"
"

  On 15 th day of delivery of mobile, mobile got shut down automatically. Not started after several attempt.Called Amazon, they said sorry could not help.

"
"

  It's good at this price range. Battery life shoul be extended a little more and camera should be improved too. I'm impressed by looking this type of screen quality at this price range. Well done Samsung👍

"
"

  The Phone has gone totally dead after 7 days...Is it manufacturing defect or is it due to delivery of substandard items....It needs to be replace.... process of warranty...its cumberson through online...

"
"

  I have received a call from technician Amazon,so very helpful,,mobile is going well now

"
"

  Overall phone is good but the internet calling and camera is not at it's best. Battery life also okay and it is in budget

"
"

  Value for money, donot expect much,its good

"
"

  Worst phone ever seen. The phone doesnt work, gets switched off within 2 days and never gets on. I got this phone replaced 2 times and still faced same issue.Dont buy is my review!

"
"

  Heating issues and battery  drains at rapid speed..

"
"

  Good design and battery, overall a good phone at this price range but I am getting some heating issues but not a deal breaker.

"
"

"
"

  Phone doesn't support some apps , while using the zoom app phone is strucking,sometimes audio and some times video is strucking, we can't see both in 1 time . It's performing like 256 mb ram phone not 2 gb ram .

"
"

  The product was not working from the 2nd day of purchase...even after escalating the problem to amazon..their response was hands free..now I have to depend on the seller for the service of NEWLY owned product...

"
"

  There is some issue in sim slot because of which network reception is poor

"
"

  Good product... But sometimes feeling that it's slow processing... its having 2GB RAM but not so effective performance

"
"

  I was sick of big phones tearing my pockets, at this price this is just amazing, thanks a million samsung, like always,

"
"

  This phone is worst... After one month the phone is dead and not charging also. I am not sure if this covers in warranty and it is additional work to go to service center.

"
"

  Very nice product..... I know that Samsung is the best Electronics Brand so I brought this Phone..... I am glad for use this..... Phone on top ranked by me I guve 5 stars of this Phone.....

"
"

  Within five days of purchase, problem occur  in display. Now the phone under dead condition. I have to run to service centre. All service center are too far from my location. So total waste and mental torture.

"
"

  Value for money.. good clarity, great storage space.Some times the mobile hangs with no response. To full charge, it takes close to 2 hours

"
"

  Battery got.discharged suddenly and did not wake up normally....samsung support advise to wake up using vol key+power key..it started again...otherwise value for money..good phone

"
"

  This phone is one of the best purchases i have ever made. It is best for whatsapp,facebook and other social media apps.Battery life is also good.Sound quality is upto the mark.Camera is also good. Must buy !!

"
"

  Product is very bad.Product purchased on 24th Sep and mobile is dead on 1st Oct.Replace window also closed on 1st Sep.What to do in this situation. Amazon should look into the matter for immediate replacement

"
"

  My phone just suddenly stop working and the display is off it is not getting switch on or off please tell me what to do. This happened when i was using my phones hotspot

"
"

  Good one in this range.2,32 is goodBattery should be 4000mah to fulfill all requirements but as Samsung is a famous brand so can't expect everything in such low cost

"
"

  Problem with signal the call will drop  in middle of conversation

"
"

  This phone stopped working after 4 hours of use. It didn’t get switched on again. Whenever  camera was on, it went very hot. Completely damaged product was given to me. Don’t buy from this seller.

"
"

  Good for this price

"
"

  Revie after 15 days of using mobile, battery comes for 4 to 5 hours in standby. Poor battery life

"
"

  Don't buy this handset... Not worth to pay this amount.. We cannot download anything#hangup#no music folder only Spotify.. Not happy with this handset can't return also.. Only replacement with same handset

"
"

"
"

   It has stop working only after 2 or 3 days of purchase which I have bought for my mother...and amazon is charging 349 rupees for looking the problem

"
"

  Its a good phone . Its Price is worth it . Display is amazing . Camera is kinda okay . The best thing is that it have android 10 go version .also light weighted .And last its trustworthy brand .

"
"

  Poor sound quality for music. Battery is draining faster, not continuing for one day in normal use. Not a good phone in ₹ 6499. Can it be possible to replace with other M series from the same seller ?

"
"

  Samsung is always best option as compare to other but I think the quality is not appropriate of this product. But in this buzet this is still the best choice..😇

"
"

  Very good one in this cost range.

"
"

  Nice , working fine up till now.. it’s been a month

"
"

  on the day of reciving the phone, it switched off all of a sudden and doesnt start back, when i tried to do a replacement , its a terrible return or help service from amazon. I didn't get any help.

"
"

  The phone charging is very very slow and suddenly goes into sleep mode. Once in sleep mode it does not charge and battery gets drained. It's not even one month and already visited the gallery twice

"
"

   I m really disappointed with the services , I purchased the phone as a gift for my mother-in-law after 2days phone goes completely dead ...bad experience

"
"

   Good

"
"

  Phone has switched off completely after 2 weeks of usage.Check for other reviews and you can find similar complaint.Do not waste your money with this phone.

"
"

  The phone is working smoothly.

"
"

  This is worst smartphone in market doesnot support many apps as well as take 7 hours in full charge. Screen is not very good and camera is worst if someone give this me in free i will not take it.

"
"

  Worst phone in every field.it takes too much time for charged

"
"

  Price withing the range of lower to middle price group. Features are great! one can go for it if they are looking for samsung ! No need to think much about it. nice.

"
"

  Battery Backup is goodScreen quality is opCamera is goodI like a mobile screen qualityNo lag No heatYou play a free fire in ultra graphics in 1gb ram in this mobile

"
"

  It’s not even been a day we’ve had it and it doesn’t turn on. Called Amazon and they say they’d send a technician!?? Ridiculous- why won’t they replace it?

"
"

  Battery was not charging from day 1, it always shows 30%

"
"

  Though the phone was worth it money but it stopped working after a day or three i have called the amazon service agent and they said tomorrow they will call waiting for it.

"
"

  Battery Life : ok at this price.Camera quality: don't use in night.  In Light Camera Performance is Tooo Good.Overall  : this phone nice choice for your parents

"
"

  I purchased a new phone on 12 Aug 2020, now it's suddenly switched off and tried my best to switch on but unable, so total waste of money

"
"

  Battery drains fast charging is very slowHeating issueIf you want to online classes or play a gameYour fingers feel burnBut phone is enough to that price segment

"
"

  Good mobile with in the budget . Hardy set with good quality but camera is not so good but overall it gives peace of mind

"
"

  Product was faulty. This mobile automatically got switched off. I also faced with difficulty while charging this phone. I would suggest spend few thousand rupees extra & buy another product

"
"

  Some functions are not available for better battery life

"
"

  The video calling and zoom application is not working with this phone. It is having audio issues only at the times of video call and zoom meeting.other than that all are in good condition.

"
"

  Worst experience of life in buying the mobile. Amazon not able to replace the faculty piece. Phone is dead on the date of delivery. My appeal to the customers not buy products from Amazon.

"
"

  Did not meet basic expectations

"
"

  Good phone to use as secondary. Light weight. Very difficult to find tempered glass for the phone.Camera very average. Overall a very average phone. Did not find any cons as of now.

"
"

  Nice Phone  this price.

"
"

  Lightweight,suitable as a second phone,senior citizens will like it.sufficient m emory for apps,my earlier samsung on 5 was lacking in memory.smooth perormance.a perfect gift to parents.

"
"

  the best part of this phone is very sleek in the model and handy lighter in weight. Worst part very very slow like an earthworm. I don't think its value for money...!

"
"

  The battery life is pathetic and the phone is turning off automatically. Would suggest not to buy this phone.Amazon support is also poor and they have refused to return the phone

"
"

  Budget phone very good it’s awesome perfect phone in low range price price is lesser than redmi phonesI got world’s best brand phone for 5.5k

"
"

  Worst phone ever purchased no battery life no good to use and stopped working just after 1 month and no service total waste of money... disguisting and not recommended at all

  You can use the mobile phone as a free ironing box... The phone gets Very very hot.. can't use it for normal data usage...worst one....

"
"

   I had just purchased Samsung Galaxy core M01 after a week the is just not working I had changed it 3 hr still it is power off.

"
"

  Value for money

"
"

  Phone comes with 1gb of ram, hangs a lot and switches off automatically. It's better spend 1 or 2k more and buy a mobile with 2+gb ram & better hardware

"
"

  Great piece for basic home use.

"
"

  Slik and handy. Value for money received the item within a day.

"
"

  Phone battery is damaged that phone get hest up in 2 mins  and no camera quality.i want my refund as its harmful to me  that can blast in my hands.i want to know about it

"
"

  Easy to carry in hand.i was looking for mobile phones under 5k because my purpose only what app for video call.so this phone is working good.Thanks Amazon & Samsung

"
"

  Good phone

"
"

  Don't buy this mobile phone ever.... it's just like old technology phone. Not useful even simple use.Total waste of money.

"
"

  Phone is very excellent according to its price.And its features are also very good.And it is very helpful for students who want to attend online class.

"
"

  It not support directly video call from jio and Airtel Sim,On average good product in low budget, but avoid purchase because volte vedeo call not support.

"
"

  worst product and support from amazon this product dont have any refund policy and mobile has heating issue.even you can not purchase any other product from same brand .

"
"

  Initiatlly I was using only single sim card now today I have inserted second Sim but second slot of the phone is not working.  Kindly resolve this issue on top priority.

"
"

  Very bad phone..Dont trust because just it is from samsungbattery is getting hot very soon,  dont buy  this phone..better to go for mi,  realme..

"
"

  Best phone under this budget.

"
"

  Good phone and value for moneyBattery:excellentDisplay:goodCamera:goodSlightly hanging  problemsAnd heating sometimes  occurs....

"
"

  Very good basic mobile. Price is cheap.

"
"

  U cannot expect more at this price 😁🔥

"
"

  Very nice. Bought it for mom.very happy. Thank you Amazon Battery is not good

"
"

  Don't buy this when I received the product it's display is not working properly and chargers is not going to charge battery and when I file return for this no body came

"
"

  Over heating problem

"
"

  This is a best smartphone in this range. We bought two mobile both are working fine.  Battary is fine. Screen size is also good. Overall phone is best for this budget.

"
"

  Phone permanently dead within 15 days. No replacement after 1 week as Amazon displayed. Now what can I do? Thinking for go to consumer court instead of service centre.

"
"

  Bad camera quality, exchanged with Samsung on5 which has same camera feature but on5 was far better. Heating problem as well, battery drains out very quickly

"
"

  As per budget this is a good phone. Camera &screen quality is good but battery power is not so satisfactory .Thanks to Samsung for giving a smartphone in this budget.

"
"

  Overall a good product from Samsung at this price range. The battery life is average.  The camera quality is good. The display screen is large . Connectivity is good.

"
"

  Battery drain very fast, mobile heats too much,inncessary pre-installed Applications, and important thing don't buy this product from amazon, because of poor service

"
"

  WHILE IN OPERATION THE PHONE GET HEATED UP TOO MUCH,BATTERY LIFE OKCAMERA FUNCTIONING OKNEED IMMEDIATE REPLACEMENT OF MOBILE SET AS FEEL DEFECTIVE.

"
"

  Do not buy this phone ever & replacement is also dead within 3 days. Samsung for India is a bogus initiative and misleading. This phone is a failure model.

"
"

  It is completely dead after using one week.. The mobile just shut off automatically and doesn't turn on.. waste of money.. i need it to be replaced at any cost....

"
"

  I worst my money. After 8hours charging when I switch on the mobile is heating.And i don't have no option for return. Only for repair solutions in amazon aap

"
"

  Nice product ...sleek phone with good quality

"
"

  This phone can be use as secondary/for aged person.screen size little bit small for regular use.

"
"

  Very good mobile phone in its price range.Battery life is good.Camera quality is  normal,long screen good for gaming and video playing,slim design,value of money.

"
"

  best phone for just basic uses,if you are a hardcore gamer or a mobi addict i won't recommend it,it gives performance as it worth,best phone to buy at this price.

"
"

  Not working that day

"
"

  This is an overall good phone.But in case of camera quality it's not good. More than that the processor speed is low and the phone starts heat!

"
"

  It's just awesome, the camera, battery and looks worth buying. I bought this for my Dad for his birthday. Thank you Amazon for timely delivery.

"
"

  My samsung m01 core battery back up is very low and it takes more than 8 hours to get charged completely.... Kindly replace my battery with in guarantee period..

"
"

  Decent smartphone for elders who are using smartphone for the first time in their life or someone who very are not using smartphone that often in daily usage.

  Update (15/08/2020):Never give a chance to regret..  Go ahead...👍The Icons looks was not so great ..  And then I set 'Spherlue Icons' from theam and now its looks better with dark mode ...Even though its 6000 Mah I always leaves phone on charging before go to bed ( I like to see my phone 100% every morning 🙂 )..  So I turned off fast charging option.. You can do that.. Its will not affect  batteryMONSTER :1. Battery :- 5/5Two day battery standby for normal easy2.Display:- 4.99/5Super amaload with full hd.. Superb Display3.Design:3/5It has a6000Mah battery,  still looking not bulky. Noglass body,  but who cares after you put a back cover..  In my opinion, don't spend more money for glass body if you uses back covers4. Camera: 3/5Back camera pretty good but front camera's low light output is very low..  many features available such as slow and super slow videos available..5. OS&UI:- 5/5Android 10 with One UI6.Finger print reader and face lock 3/5 Face lock and finger print reader are not so fast7.Processor and performance 3.5/5Exynos 9611 is not meant for PUBG gamers  .. But for me its perfect as I am not a heavy gamer..  No lag ang hang till now..  but processor is outdated..8. Charging :2.5/5. No fast charging.. Provided with a 15W charger and iy takes about 3 Hrs to fully reacharge the phone9. Accessories : 2/5No earphone, No Back cover, No Screenguard..  So order backcover and tempered glass when you placing order as its backbody is plastic amd more prone to scratches..10.Loud speaker 1.5/5Loudspeaker sound level is very low.. (Keep earphones)Verdict: For this price  Its the best choice if you are not a hardcore gamer  ...

"

  As a title it is obviously a monsterAnd very very good performance

"

  Brilliant camera, huge battery life and brilliant display in addition with the premium feeling of SAMSUNG. It's a shame that this phone's launch was delayed due to lockdown.Highly Recommended phone 😊😊

"
"

  I am writing my review after using it for 6 days.I have bought sumsung phone after 7 years hoping it could be good phone but samsung again disappointed me a lot.They claim it has 6000mAH battery but drain like 3000mAH and it take almost 2.30hrs to charge from 10% to 90% so its fast charging is not a fast charging. Its just a market gimic to clail it monester like features i.e.battery 6000mAH ,15W fast charge ete but reality is far far away from claims.Others features are as per price range but if you thinking for a battery packed phone with fast charge,then I would sugget plz search for others phone in same range.

"
"

  Defective product received, it gets 8 to 12 hours in charging and Amazon is not exchanging the product

"
"

  Very poor performance. Hangs aloft. Even I don't use any gaming app. In browsing only, this phone lacks. Inspite of having 6 GB RAM. This product serves zero rating. Please don't buy  this. Wastage of money. No refund policy for this device.

"
"

  I love this one, and this is best in class, no.1 best budget mobile and Samsung mobile brand also global no.1 brand in the world. Great one, my rating is more than 5star, thanks to Samsung n Amazon.

"
"

  Value for money.I am not a gamer. So can't say about the gaming performance. But for those who are buying it for normal usage, this phone is great. With 6gb ram,128 GB internal storage and Amoled display I am more than satisfied.I have been using Samsung phones from the start. Samsung's Amoled screen is what I am attracted to the most. The feel it gives is simply amazing.But battery dont seem to be a 6000 mah.As far as a non gamer is concerned this phone is the best under this price range.

  Even realme performs better.....few issues which concerned me after use were1. When recording slow motion videos...there is  always flicker on screen.2. fingerprint sensor needs more than few attempts to work3. Camera is better than realme but not as good as redmi4. Battery survives one and half day......which is bad because till now I m using it only for WhatsApp and call......I wonder what will happen when I use it for gaming5. Heats when i charge....not expected from a world class company phone6. Mobile data connection vanishes many times in a day...I thought it was my airtel network .....but the same sim works on my old volte phone...without any issue....Suggestions for people who have bought this phone.....Since company does not provides a screen guard..... Please add a screen guard as soon as possible.....because my phone got little scratches ....as I had kept my bike keys and phone in same pocket....I am repenting on not applying screen guard on my phone early...Suggestions for People who have not bought this phone.....If you are low on budget then only select this model ......otherwise go for some other model of Samsung or any other brand.....by adding few more bucks....I am attaching two videos one in normal mode.....second in slow mode.....both videos are made by m21......you can see the flikr effect in second video easily..

  Heating problem. In simple browising only phone gets heated up in upper side. When asking for replacement amazon customer care they are fooling us. Very pathetic condition.

"
"

  Just one word AMAZING

"
"

  The phone(M21 Raven Black) is not working properly since its purchase. After the first installation, it is on frequently on and off mode and even restarts after more than 30 minutes. Moreover 4-5 times it takes more than 2 hours for starting.I also register a complaint to Amazon regarding this. I don't need such a disgusting phone any more. it wastes my 3 days. So, I request to Amazon kindly refund my money, I don't need replacement.

"
"

  Now Amazone has REPLACED THE DAMAGED ONE NOW THE PHONE IS GOOD ENOUGH...PREVIOUS ONE WAS Nonsence What A Nonsence Battery It Comes to 90% Charge After a full charge only if u do something in10 minutes.... What nonsence is this. NEED REPLACEMENT. Do you people think customers are Mad.

"
"

  Otg pendrive not supported

  This phone's video,photo quality and audio quality is very poor

  After 5 hrs continuously  charging level reach 55 %,during call sound quality not clear,a lot of heating problem,camera quality not good,network issue,slow processing..poor performance

"

  Heating problems

  Looks like just to clear the unsold stock of m30s they gave it a new name and advertised it as a totally new phone. Everything is similar to m30s, except the price (and selfie camera). Good thing is that they kept the price low.Just got it delivered today. So far so good, many users compalined about battery, charging speed, display issues on m30s. Hope they got it resolved in m21.

  Worst phone of my life I have ever purchase . Due to this pandemic situation and blaming china for this corona virus I have decided to purchase a korian company phone . But I broke up my trust . Battery life is poor as it's shows 6000Mah but performance wise it's behave like 4000Mah. Bcuz it's drain so quickly processor is very slow it's hang up in 5 minute and heat like u can make your veggie on this even it's can burn ur ears finger print is not responding I have washed my hand many time but it's not ready to recognize it's. Finally my humble request to amazon pls return this I have made a big mistake to purchase it. Pls help me to return it

"
"

  A nice looking phone.Light weight because of the plastic body. Performance is pretty good.But it doesn't feel like a 6000 mAh battery. Probably a little shy of that figure. It Drains relatively quickly than what is expected of a 6000 mAh capacity.But overall a product worth it's price. Probably not good for high performance gaming.But expect it to be durable with a low-medium usage.

"
"

  Samsung Co. Claims that Samsung M21 has fast charging facility and It has 6000 mAh battery but these two claims are totally bogus because I've purchased Samsung M21 and received my order yesterday after using this phone I plugged in charger for charging it took approximate 9 hours to charge the Mobile phone and after full charging approximate 2 hours the Mobile phone battery get reduced 50%. I'm totally disappointed with this phone.

"
"

  Don't like this product. It looks, it's already used by someone else. Apps are not downloading. It shows 6 appsare downloading. I'm confused.

"
"

  I bought the Raven Black, 4GB-64GB variant of the Samsung Galaxy M21 for my mother. I'm impressed with the phone's overall usability. Since my mother is not a heavy user unlike me, I decided to go for Samsung by considering the brand value and overall specs of the phone. The main requirements for my mom are- Good display for media consumption, good battery life and a clean and easy to use UI without any unnecessary ads. Since the Galaxy M21 ticks all the right boxes I decided to go for this phone. Moreover my mother was using a Samsung Mobile prior to this and hence she was accustomed with the functionality of the UI.-The display of the phone is brilliant and at par with the Amoled display of my Redmi K20 Pro.-The battery life is also very good and it easily gives 1.5 days backup even under heavy usage. The only complain I have is the length of the charging cable which is very short.- The performance is good too for day to day usage. The Exynos 9511 is fairly capable and I haven't seen any stutter or lag in UI. If you are ahardcore gamer than I would recommend to look for alternative since it would not perform as good as its competition in regards to gaming. For casual gamers it will do the job well.-The cameras on this phone are brilliant with very good image processing done by Samsung. It takes pictures with natural colours.- The speaker output is average. Its loud enough but the sound produced is nothing impressive since it lacks bass and that clarity in the sound output.- The audio output via the 3.5mm Jack is very good as it supports Dolby Atmos.- The fingerprint sensor is very fast but the face unlock feature is not that consistent as it sometimes fails to read your face.Hence, overall it is a great value package from Samsung and I would highly recommend this phone to everyone looking for a good phone at this price point unless he/she is a heavy gamer. Thanks for reading.Update: After the Software update on 17 June the face unlock feature got extremely fast and accurate.😀

  I am writing this review after one-week use of Samsung Galaxy M21.The only good point is amazing Samsung one UI 2.0 and sAMOLED displayThe issues I faced are1. Super Slow Camera: It is taking 2-4 sec to capture the photo with 48 MP camera2. Heating issue: Many time with normal using I observed some heating on the top of the backside3. Poor Network Antenna: I was using MOTOROLA in the same area and receiving a better signal (latency few milliseconds) as compared to Galaxy M21 (Latency and signal strength are quite low in same ISP).4. Big Battery but Worst Performance: Battery backup is not satisfactory and only a little better than 3400 mAh with Snapdragon SoC based phone. Additionally, it is taking a huge amount of time for charging.Among all these issues I believe it is an average deal under 13k

"
"

  Amazon delivered a defective phone to me and then they don't even receive my call while I tried to approach them.  Buying Samsung Galaxy M21 is waste of money.

"
"

  Samsung m21 Mobile not in the delivery box, only charger and pin are available. Need refund for the same.For mobiles, its better to opt for cash on delivery, to avoid getting cheated.

"
"

  1. I bought this to gift it to my dear one but I am shocked to see the camera quality of this phone is like 1 mb. I tried all the modes but it enhances the photo brightness automatically and and the photo becomes like a cartoon.2. Tried installing other camera apps but still the quality is poor.3. Tried options for returning but found that there is no option for that.4. Spoke to customer care and they say that they can only replace if the product is damaged and no option for quality related issues. I said that I am ready to buy any other product too. But no response from them.It’s better to buy from local store than going behind Amazon.

"

  I like the camera quality, screen sensitivity,  and browsing experience. The speed is excellent.I don't like it's sound. The speaker is not the best, sometimes when I put on loud speaker the person I am speaking to will complain they cannot hear me. Plus when I play music the sound is not the best. Also, the phone does not come with original earphones so you have to hustle for that. Lastly it will take 3 hours to charge and still the battery will only last for 24hours.

  Display good, battery  performance  after one  week  of use has improved,camera is good,hope Samsung  provides  regular  updates..Excellent  phone  keep good  work  up Samsung 👌

  There are some strong point which will force you to buy this phone.1. One UI 2.0 - I would say Samsung's UI is the best experience you can ever feel in any budget phone. This is the strongest point which no youtuber will tell you ever.2. Screen - none other brand offers this quality of screen in their phone of same budget. A user's first priority is screen because 24/7 he/she just need to see on the screen, no metter whatever thing is he using in his phone.Camera- daylight shots are amazing as all the Samsung's phone do. Color contrast is and image processing is better then redmi note 9 pro and realme 6 which is rs1300 more. but night shots are not as good as other brands give.Battery- after 2hrs pubg and regular social media usage you can enjoy this phone from morning 7am to evening 12pm.Charging speed is very slow. It took 2hrs and 30 mins to fully charge.Performance- No doubt Exynos 9611 is not as good as sd720g or helioG90t. But in daily task you will not face any lag on this phone.For pubg gamer-you will notice lag in high resolution gaming but if you want to play without lag then obviously you have to play in Smooth+Ultra it will give you a best performance without any issue.

  What can I say just after 30 min.of recieving this phone I applied for return my money. Before this phone I already have 2 phone of Samsung's working good but this phone made in India is hot like a oven.I can't take it near my ears .I have to use ear phone.I call customer care they give me different different idea but problem remain same.I don't give advice to buy this product to any one be careful.

  Battery  drain quickly... and phone heat a lot.

  I got phone having mic issue and there is no option to put a replacement request as i tried download the blanco app that doesnt work and just hanged in between and no technical person available to check whenever i called..so how would i place the request to replacement??

  Amazing phone But m not satisfied with camera quality, its 48MP? I used samsung galaxy S8 its only 12MP single camera which is good for m21 tripple camera.One more thing is back panel is plastic which is not good looking inthis range ..Its not feel premium with this budget....

"
"

  recently i ordered samsung M21 6GB RAM 128GB Flash.Unboxed and started the phone. it surprised to see so much of heated while booting itself.I tried to inform to Amazon . they tested with some remote diagnostics application surprisingly it showed the temperature is degree.I am using Samsung phones long time. this time my experience with M21 is very very badNew buyers please little careful about heating issue

"

  Received Samsung M 21 yesterday..highly disappointed  about slow charging and poor quality of camera..did not expect this from Samsung.I suggest not to buy this mobile.

  Great phone. There is no overheating like others say. For the price you getting a quality phone with massive battery life.Here are the pros:-Good qualityExcellent displayExcellent batteryBest cameraHere are the cons:-Speaker quality is not good. It's loud but distorted at high volume with no bass at allHeadphone quality is ok. Not the best. I prefer wireless because of Dolby AtmosCharging speed is ok, not fast nor slow. It took 2hrs to fully charge. It's fast for 6000mahCamera app need a redesignAside all this.. it is the best phone under 15k.Go for it.

  I have previously purchased m30s but the the signal strength was very weak so I had to to sell the phone on OLX . Apart from the signal strength the phone was awesome I had used Nokia 1 and the internet was superfast by using the same sim card. I suppose Samsung reduces the signal strength in order to reduce the SAR rating. I understand that SAR rating is harmful to our body and brain but Nokia is far excellent in terms of signal strength.Samsung phones are excellent in terms of providing good specifications in budget. Now coming to this phone camera is good, touch responsiveness is excellent, it is having Wi-Fi calling which was not mentioned on the comparison websites such has 91Mobiles neither on the specifications on any otyer website. So M21 is having all the features as comparison to m30s.M21 is having Gorilla Glass which m30s lacksM21 is having Android 10 version As compared to Android 9 of m30s but m30s can be upgraded to Android 10, 11This phone lacks NFC which is present in A30s  A50sBattery is 6000 mah but Nokia phones having the same processor, screen size with 3500 MH batteries are running the same duration as this phone. So 6000 image battery is just a marketing gimmick.Charging even using the type C fast charger takes up to 4 hours for full charge. Battery lasts for one day after heavy usage.Pros:Super amoled screen6000 MaH batteryCons:Signal strength is very poor.(You will have to wait for almost a year to download an app)Since I watch internet TV so I rely on the hotspot (signal strength) in order to buffer the web series movies etc

  Good product

"
"

  The phone is simply amazing. The Raven Black model looks gorgeous. Very sturdy. The camera quality is excellent. The UI is user friendly. This phone is similar to the Samsung range of phones, so it is hard to decide the model that's best for its price. According to my analysis, M21 is a good by at 12699/-.

"
"

  At this cost, the phone looks premium. For folks who like a premium looking phone not the fancy looking phone, this is the best at this price segment. all other products at this price bracket consist of fancy and decorated back which may not be the cup of tea for a section of people for whom simple and plain is the premium. Monster battery, One of the best display at this price segment, great finger print sensor, decent camera etc.. If you are a non gamer, go for it...Only problem i faced is delay in delivery (almost 10 days).

"
"

  Pathetic phone. It is overheating and I am not able to use it. Worst customer service from Amazon guys as they are saying blanco app shows heating as normal in diagnosing. Awful service and worst phone.

"
"

  Not as expected from samsung, this phone heated very badlly , it's heated in ideal mode too, started slowly slowly and within 5-10 minutes it's heated extremely.

"

  I received a samsung galaxy M 21 which is defective, as it does not start, or it does not even charge. Please help me initiate a return for the same

"
"

  I got this phone on 15th of May.I am writing this review  after 5 days of usage...1.Battery backup is not very good. It's good but not like 6000mah at all.Also charging is really slow.2.It's SAmoled screen is best in this price range.3. Processor is not very powerful,I have noticed some occasional lags.4.Heating issue detected in front camera areasIt's not like overheat or something but it is hot.5.Os is good but there is no network speed meter function present natively.6.FB app is keep refreshing it's feed when I minimize and open the app again after some time.7.Sometimes app crashes without any reason.8.The phone is heavy not too heavy but you can easily notice it after some day's of usage.9.At 12699 price I don't think there is any other phone is as good as this is,atleast for now.10.It doesn't have Good lock and native screen recorder present in OS neither you can sideload them.This is unfair I think.

  Mind blowing  mobile .. dear mates don't go for this.. network related issues  frequently  will get. 3 and 4 bars network  points is related to 1 and 2 bars in samsung.. what they mention in community samsung I'll tried. But nothing .. so please think before purchase .. big disappointment  in samsung m21.. check in screenshots  that's In some outdoors  lan area if u go upstairs  1 more bar extra only showing,same thing I checked in some other mobile it's showing full .. I think some issue in m21.. please release the update. I'm very dissatisfied about samsung.. actually  I love this design  and camera...

"
"

  Nice rear camera and nice selfie camera but front camera struggles at night , sound is superb, display is awesome, battery ok, fingerprint reader superfast, I would suggest 6GB variant.

"
"

  The best to choose among the available choices in this range.  I am using it since one week and I am fully impressed with all the features. The camera quality and battery life are excellent. Fingerprint reader is very fast.  Elegant design and wonderful display. The user interface is also very good.  Only difficulties I faced was to find app lock and split screen. But these purposes were fulfilled by external apps from the play store.I strongly recommend purchasing this phone. The best value for money product. I am full satisfied with the purchase 😊

  Just after starting the phone I am facing the heating problem . I have bought two phone in both of them there is over heating .

  Ski charging and bad network connection

  So, here it is after using it for more than a month. this phone has a lot of impressive features but lacks a bit of punch when it comes to processing power.My usage is mostly for calling, whatsapp, and video viewing, i don't use much of social media apps and not into too much gaming as well. Still this phone manages to freeze even with just one app running it can be just the chrome browser. Here is summary of what i observed  - Samsung one ui comes with lot of annoying advertisement and notifications, i suspect these galaxy app hog cpu in the background  - Privacy is a huge concern specially with discover feature  - For those who are accustomed to having google news feed by swiping right on home screen, you will find it missing in this phone  - Phone freezes a lot, typical workaround for me is to lock it and wait for a minute unlock and it works  - Wide angle camera shots are really good  - camera quality is nice as well  - battery life is  great, i am charging every two days instead of daily night  - look and finish a not extra-ordinary but are not bad as well  - Does not allow you to restore from google backup on start which is a headache on setting it up, it does come with samsung switch app but that would just install app and cannot restore login and data like google restoreverdict=====Buy this if you are ok with advertisements (i guess same is true with mi, realme etc) from samsung, not too much into heavy usage like gaming etc.Edit 1====phone freeze issue reduced by a lot by removing external sd card. Browser does freeze sometimes but the frequency is a lot lessSamung ui misses user friendly sms/call blocking, you have to select individual message sender details and then block which is a headache and can be improved

  Everyone is removing Chinese products from their life and hence I also planned to throw Xiaomi from my gadget and start using Samsung from now onwards. I further thought to convince my friends & relatives to use Samsung gadgets instead of Xiaomi. But after purchasing Samsung Galaxy M21 from Amazon which was delivered on 30-05-2020, my whole enthusiasm went in trash and I am helpless to compare it with my last handset Redmi 8 which was valued just Rs. 7,999/- as compared to Rs. 12,699/- of Samsung Galaxy M21. I don’t want to compare Samsung with Xiaomi handsets, but now realize how Xiaomi has captured Indian market in short span of time, surely because of quality & performance of their gadgets.I am trying Amazon customer care since 01-06-2020, but unable to connect and no response from their side. Below are serious issues found in just 2-3 days of using Samsung Galaxy M21 :• While using wi-fi calling feature, outgoing calls & receiving of SMS gets completely barred• While using wi-fi, HD call gets stopped• Whole battery gets drain in just 6-7 hours, not upto 6000 mAh handset performance.• Fingerprint sensor is very weak, it takes 3-4 times for login• Dual apps feature is limited for few applications only• Voice recording feature needs improvementPlease support in getting this issue resolved at the earliest.

  When the phone arrived 1st 2days are quite good and phone worked perfectly.  But after 2days it started showing sone battery problems and battery lasts only upto 3 to 4 hrs which not accepted with this phone and it's getting even worse now. And now Amazon is not responding to it . It seems like i lost my 13 thousand money.  If any help provided it means alot to me coz i didn't expected this kind of trust issue with amazon.

  Before I go into details, let me admit that I was a staunch ""hater"" of Samsung Android phones, specially in the low mid range. The first and last Samsung phone I used was a Galaxy Core, back in 2012. I absolutely hated it, and promised to never buy a Samsung phone ever. But then there was an ad and I purchased this M21.. Samsung again, after 8 years. And during these 8 years, I have used Sony Xperia, Moto G, Redmi 4, Redmi Note 7 Pro. So my review is actually a comparison of those phones with this beast.The major advantage of this phone, compared to my Moto G, is the brilliant sAmoled display with Full HD resolution (not 720p, thank God).Processor is so optimised for this phone that it works like a breeze and stays cool like, unlike my both Redmi's. I dont bother the fact that its not a Snapdragon. Performance and usability is so much optimised that you shall never complain.Battery backup is a perfect two day affair, for more than normal usage. Screen on time is excellent. I can easily go through 2 days even after streaming web series and talking a lot on phone calls.The only thing that bothered me is the finger print sensor. Its not a feather touch one, definitely. But it still works pretty good, once you put your finger on inlt properly.For me, its a very good deal under 15k. Would recommend this to anyone, even when blind folded!

  Samsung galaxy m21 (I'm having 4gb ram variant) is a excellent phone in this price segment.Pros:1. Best display under 20k2. Great audio quality via headphones jack (supports dolby audio which is obviously a gimmick but this phone has high res support hence if you have Poweramp you would get maximum quality performance from it.) and has a loud output from loud speaker.3. Excellent battery life (for heavy use easily getting SOT more than 8 hours)4. Great for watching movies supports for FHD+ playback in ott.5. Good performance, not stutters or lag I have noticed (I usually dont keep more than 3 apps in background when in not use).6. Games don't lag or have frame drops if I have moderate graphics. (Even pubg runs great in smooth and extreme settings).7. Samsung One UI is the best next to stock Android (Oxygen os, stock android no big difference except few additional features in Oxygen os). Also comes with Android 10 out of the box.8. Decent camera quality both front and back.9. Unlike previous m series phones this one comes with Corning Gorilla glass 3 and I haven't applied any screen protection and have no scratches till now🤞🤞🤞10. Multitasking is the best feature in this phone. Pop up view mode is a excellent festures. Helps to play games listening to music in youtube or other apps, text messages, browse web simultaneously with this large display.Cons :1. Plastic back can easily get scratched can be avoided using a case.2. Could have added 18W fast charging capabilities takes 2-2.5hours to fully charge (from 15 or 20% to 100).3. Not for gamers who expect high graphics. But recommend for casual gamers or gamers who would be okay to play in moderate graphics.4. Worst camera quality in night mode. Night mode photos are totally unusable. (Samsung may fix this issue with software update if they work on this issue)Conclusion:Don't know why many are complaining about poor battery life or heating issue or games totally unplayable complaints. Dont spread false informations.I haven't faced these issue, even in heavy useage.Buy this phone if you want a all-rounder phone which ticks every boxes.Fyi,Like all other phones in this price segment, even Samsung pushes ads, but here during initial setup of the phone it ask if we would opt for recommendations. If we opt out we wont get any ads and recommendations.👍👍👍

  Battery charging takes too much time and when opted for replace, so much of formalities by amazon. Highly disappointed of purchasing such a valuable item from Amazon. Only by technician check, and after his report, amazon decides whether the item should be replaced or not. No value for customer words. Very bad experience with amazon purchase.

"
"

  Believe me...the best smartphone you can buy at this price range if you are not a hardcore gammer...don't compare it with cheap Chinese products.

  This is my second review.  This is after a week's use. So far I have found that phone is good. In my first review I had tod that battery is not that good. But now I feel that I was wrong. A day almost 10 to 20 percentage battery drain. (Only finish).One of the main problem I face is the search button for contacts. It is placed in a corner and that too very small. And if I search a contact. After few days if I open contacts again, what I searched will still remain there. I have to go all the way back to search again.

"
"

  Of no use.totaly waste of money

"
"

  Recieved it today.1) Battery is excellent- can last for 2 days with average usage.2) Camera is good according to price of Mobile- Don't expect DSLR level clarity but it's good.3) Phone is running without any lag. not a gamer so haven't run any game.4) Network and voice clarity is excellent. Haven't faced any problem.5) Touch ID is respsonsive.I would say in this price segment, the phone comes with excellent qualities.

"
"

  It's all in one product. With a big battery life and large display. Back camera is awesome with all the beautiful colours. The best thing I like about samsung is that it's user friendly. My first android was Samsun and the new one too. Am too excited abt using this new watta monster with 6000 battery life and 48mp camera.

"
"

  Best phone under 14k price. If you won't buy other brands then it is best for you.  ~😋Good things -• 6000 mAh monster battery• Best display from Samsung Super Amoled display• 15 watt fast changing• Decent Camera Quality• One UI, Brand Value & Service 🥰• Dolby Atmos  ~😞Bad things -• Old Processor 9611 (moderate gaming)• Plastic back and little bit thick  So, if you not a professional gamer or want to gift your parents then go for it.

  Let me be Straightforward, being passionate photographer I was looking for a budget Smartphone with a nice Camera and good Specs. But after Purchasing Samsung's M21 what I had found was it is Monstrous in every aspects of a budget Smartphone. From Monstrous Battery life to an Amazing Camera, Nice Ram Management, Clean One UI 2.0, and tons of other perks...If you are looking for a Monstor Budget Smartphone from a Reliable, Reputed and Trustworthy Brand then without wasting time go for this one !!!❤

"

  Best budget phone..Really awesome 😊😊I recommend everyone to buy this mobile in less than 15k marginBattery is excellentFingerprint sensor is very fastCamera is ultimate

"
"

  Guess it was a problem with the seller, and not the product. The seller just delivered a used product with loads of defects. The camera was not functioning, the torch was not functioning and there could be more defects. I was just checking the item the moment it was delivered and encountered with these two defects. Upon unboxing, I found that the phone had a tempered glass already fitted to it. Initially I overlooked this but later realized that someone who had purchased it invested on the glass (and may have used it for a couple of days) with the defects before finally rejecting it. I think the M21 product should be fine and it is upon the seller who tried to strike a deal in such troubled times. So beware of the seller!

  Camera quality not that much what we expect rear and selfy both camera -pic quality missed , battery life max 18hours if we used data , This report as of after 3days usage

  Worst product it takes so much time to chargeHow can a person charge for al10 hrs to fully charge the battery.Its insane and am not able to replace the item.Amazon must be liable for this product.

  What a nonsense phone this is.. battery performance is very disappointed... 4000 mah is  too better than it's battery.... more than 12% battery is losing in night-morning.... heating is another important issue ... with out playing any games or hard use, this phone heats high... display quality is so good... don't by this phone, considering its battery... no use.. charging time is very high..... Redimi note 9 pro is 100* better than this phone... Realme nazro 10 performes 2*better than this... dont go with this phone... be aware

  Hello guys so I just ordered this phone and it's almost 10 days to get this phone in hand and the first of all this phone is having a gorgeous display but there is one major issue. Which I need to highlight is this phone have serious network issue I have also shown this issue to my nearest Samsung Service Centre they even can't help me so if you guys have a very  bad network or average Network at your home or your workplace so this phone is not for you..

  galaxy m21 review:-first of all, it's a very similar device to the galaxy m30s galaxy a50s and galaxy a51 in terms of internal you can't tell the difference between galaxy m30s and m21 in just looking at it. there are some differences between the two devices but not a lot.good:-Display:- so this is the main feature of this phone a full HD super AMOLED display on a 14000 rupees phone is very rear and this the differentiating feature of this device, which include lots of feature of own it's own such as always on true notch hiding and some battery-saving features so it doesn't have the on-screen fingerprint sensor which frankly speaking a good thing because Samsung's in-screen fingerprint sensor is bad really bad it's that bad you  prefer not to use it, and it's fingerprint also have swipe gestures for the notifications which work all the time unlike it's the in-display fingerprint sensor.Software:- software is also really good and it has some neat feature too like the system-wide dark mode which saves battery on the AMOLED screen's and clean and well thought out layout for the one-handed use a good if not great out of the box launcher with few customizations, unlike some Chinese OEM's software, hex installer, and the good lock is absent which is a big bummer for the customization freaks and overall it's nicer UI than most of the Chinese ones and one thing more it also supports android 10's stock navigation gestures which are a heck of a lot better than MIUI's.battery:- it's a full day battery comfortably with all the necessary sensors on the auto-brightness and vibration both of which disabled out of the box for some reason ""because Samsung thinks we are a fool"" it's a 6000 MAH battery if this type capacity would provide another phone my be it was juice it out little longer than this phone does.camera :- this is very strange camera in default camera app shoots very saturated photo and the video is good honestly quite good for the price in day light in nights this phone just falls apart very easily, and wide angle camera is fixed focus which is a good thing or bad thing I don't know, I use it very occasionally and I I am surprised to see that AR doodle and AR emoji is present In it's camera app which is nice bonus.Bad or desired thingBuilt quality:- it's a have a plastic back with a plastic frame means it's a plastic phone and have plastic's quirks like despite having a 6000 mAh battery, it feels light, relatively thin and more ergonomic, it's a plastic, plastic materials are more prone to be scratched but it more durable than glass, if tap on the back around the camera it creates hollow sound so built quality is not on par with the competition.performance: - performance leaves a bit desired because it handles everyday stuff like WhatsApp Instagram and other productivity Apps quite smoothly and in games, it's fall flat in front of the competition and in the 4gb variant 2GB of memory is occupied by the system already so ram Management is an issue in this device, and the stupid battery optimization is killing all the third-party apps in the background some of the like the music app suddenly stops playing song after 1 hrs, you have to disable the battery optimization from the setting in each app you use in the background all the time.Bloat & Ads:- it has all the Microsoft suits preloaded and be careful when you set up the device at the start don't select the option ad recommendation option. even after that my galaxy apps constantly send the spammy notification.so it worth 14000? In my use case yes! I am not a heavy user I don't play heavy games on my phone, for the heavy users, there are lots of better offerings on the online market!

"
"

  Only display is good. Sound quality and ring volume is Not good. Some most important features like App Lock is missing in this phone. You have to download a third party App to encrypt your App. This is very disappointed. Ring volume is very low and very limited ringtones. User interface is not good even Not user friendly. No headphones, No back cover, No screen guard. Dear Samsung, you need some research in this field otherwise you will be eliminated. Very bad experience.

"
"

  It's kind request to everyone who is looking for this device, Don't buy it unless you live in area where network strength is strong.Network fluctuating all the time, hardly you Will get 4G, forgot volte Main issue is camera ... after 11 days i saw dust inside camera lens,  dust in brand new phone, Amazon customer care told after 10 days we don't care about anything, talk to Samsung customer care. Samsung care says go to nearest service center,Service center vale says submit your phone, we will see.  Aatmnirbhar ke chakkar me apna chutiya mat katva Lena bhaiyo. Although battery is too good, display is premium.

  No wonder why Samsung is the most used & most loved smartphone brand in the world! This is my first Samsung phone and I exchanged my previous damaged phone online for 2k.After spending one whole month in researching the best phone under 15k, I finally got it figured out and chose Galaxy M21. And Youtube videos and comments helped me take the wise choice. I got the deal (4gb 64gb) at Rs.13,500 and got it delivered in 6 days.Plenty of reasons why I chose M21:Will to honour our country heroesMonster BatteryGreat Display (feels like you are also present in the movie)Trust in Samsung Brand NameBetter CameraLesser weight (a boon for long time gamers)Polycarbonate back (safe against drops)Premium look rather than Fancy Nancy cheap plastic bodyType C ChargerThe Processor Debate:To those who wonder the same as I did (If we can play Pubg smoothly),The honest answer is YES. Pls do not take third opinions who claim that Exynos processor is lame (which is a false claim of knowledge). I can't say if it is bad or awesome, but it is definitely Decent! You can play Smooth+Extreme or Balanced+Ultra without any issue. Even if you do full and heavy usage for 12 hours continiously, battery is sufficient and fast charging works too. So i easily charge every night before going to sleep and turn it off in middle of night.Super Tips for Common Problems in All PhonesUpdate OS to avoid heating & restart issue (which happens not only in M21 but even in 60k phonesNever use a phone cleaner or battery saver app. Use the inbuilt power saving option.Turn off Bluetooth, Location, etc when not neededDon't charge even after reaching 100%Close apps when not needed, especially close all when playing game (and also enable gaming mode)Uninstall least used appsWhoever reads this comment can trust me and click the Amazon ""Buy Now"" button without any fear because this is the ONE perfect-ish smartphone under 15k category.Friends.... this phone feels like you hold jewel in your hand .

  No doubt i am loving Samsung m 21 4/64, which i ordered on 25th may, got delivered on 27th may. One thing to consider, this smartphone excels in display, camera quality and battery life...Processor is not that  powerful or not even close to sd 675 in terms of gaming. I have to use gfx tool, lowering resolution( less than hd) and other graphics stuff to Low with fps set to ultra(40fps). By applying this gfx tools settings i can play Pubg hell lot better with stable 30-40 fps. Dont try extreme,fps will be very unstable. With stock Pubg settings i am facing tremendous lags, stutters and fps drops even in the lobby, Cant say about 6/128 gb model. Didn't try Cod, i usually dont play, Pubg lite plays fine with smooth extreme option only. My verdict if u are not too much into gaming, Play clash of clans, or can adjust to above settings of Pubg, Go ahead to buy,  If pubg is top priority go with Vivo U20/Realme 6/Redmi note 9.

"

  Review for 6GB/128GB varient (Review after one month use)Pros: Really a amazing phone in peformance wise. smooth like iphone. Battery last for three days even with wifi and bluetoooth connected for almost 10 hours a day. High end games are running without lag. Dual speakers so music plays loud. No heating issue as of now. Depth camera is really cute, you must experience it to believe. Corrila glass doing its part perfectly. No scraches even after rough one month usage. Screen resolution in amazing; Super Amoled is really superb. Finger print senson is fast (even less than a second)Cons: Apart from depth camera all other cameras are not upto the mark. But its ok for unprofessional use. Not recommended for selife freakouts. Phone is little heavey due to 6000 MAH.

  For those who are still using old Galaxy phones like the Galaxy J2, I think the Galaxy M21 would make logical sense.Samsung Galaxy M21: Although the phone excels on many fronts, my two favorite features remain the battery life and the quality of the display.A few months back, Samsung successfully made big-battery smartphones accessible with its M-series. But the mid-range is a tough segment to crack with the competition from the likes of Xiaomi and Realme. But Samsung knows how critical this segment is right now, given the current situation where consumers are more price-sensitive than ever. For these uncertain times, the new Galaxy M21 makes a lot of sense. Here’s a closer look at what it’s been like to use the Galaxy M21 over the past week.Samsung Galaxy M21 specifications: 6.4-inch FHD+ SAMOLED display|Exynos 9611 processor, 4GB/6GB RAM or 64GB/128GB storage|48MP main camera+5MP depth and 8MP ultra wide angle|6000mAh batery|20MP front camera|188grams, 8.9mm thick|Android 10, OneUI 2.0Samsung doesn’t try to be different with the Galaxy M21, and that’s just fine. Let me be clear: I don’t have too many things to say about the Galaxy M21 because the phone looks exactly like the Galaxy M31. So, the Galaxy M21 has a polycarbonate back like the Galaxy M31. Some people may not find it interesting but it never felt like using a cheap plastic phone.For a phone with a 6000mAh battery, the design and build seem perfect. I also liked the fact that the phone doesn’t feel heavy or bulky, considering the massive battery inside the device. However, I do feel the Galaxy M-series phones have become a bit too dull in terms of design. To be frank, none of this matters to a user who is coming from the Galaxy J-series or any older generation Samsung phone.Although the phone excels on many fronts, my two favorite features remain the battery life and the quality of the display. The 6,000mAh battery in the Galaxy M21 goes on and on. It managed to last one and a half days with my standard usage pattern, which includes browsing the web, listening to Spotify, emails, checking Facebook and Twitter, and light gaming. Since the phone’s battery lasts for so long, you don’t want to worry about taking the charger with you. A quick-charge with the charger fills the phone’s battery in minutes.Another aspect of the M21 that I liked the most is the display. This is a big phone with a 6.4-inch Full HD+ display. And since the phone uses an AMOLED display, the contrast level is great and the black levels are absolute. Even though a lot of mid-range phones these days offer AMOLED displays, the ones made by Samsung have better displays somehow. I found the screen absolutely fine for reading eBooks, watching YouTube, and web browsing. By the way, the small U-shaped notch doesn’t annoy me anymore. It did annoy me a lot at the beginning but it soon becomes a part of the scenery.Speaking of performance, the Galaxy M21 is powered by the same Exynos 9611 chipset that you find on the Galaxy M31. Samsung has used this processor on many of its mid-range phones and going by my testing, the chipset gets the job done. I was able to open all of the popular apps like Facebook, Twitter, and TikTok on the device without any issues. But don’t try to run too many heavy games that could slow down the performance. The phone runs on Android 10, and Samsung has done a good job with OneUI 2.0. My review unit had 4GB RAM and 64GB of storage.You won’t get a great camera system, and that’s one area where I think the phone falls flat. You get a 48MP primary camera sensor alongside an 8MP ultra-wide camera and a 5MP depth camera. The 48MP main sensor is a hit and miss. Sometimes the photos look great and other times the photos come out of focus. That’s not to say the camera is bad, it is just not consistent. The Galaxy M21 takes bright shots but in some cases, images lack richness. Even though the phone lets you take ultra-wide angle shots or bokeh shots I wasn’t too impressed. In comparison to the Galaxy M31, the Galaxy M21 pales in the camera department. For a change, though, the Galaxy M21’s 20MP front-camera surprisingly worked well both indoors and outdoors.The Galaxy M21 performs similarly to the Galaxy M31. I mean, both phones have a 6000mAh battery, identical processors and displays, and even the design is the same. What the Galaxy M21 noticeably lacks, however, is a camera that’s not at par to the Galaxy M31. Still, there’s a lot to love about the Galaxy M21. For those who are still using old Galaxy phones like the Galaxy J2, I think the Galaxy M21 would make logical sense.

   After reading a lot of reviews regarding network issues of the M31 and M21 I was a bit skeptical to buy the M21. I was using Huawei honor phones until now because of their excellent call quality and network reception. After using the Honor 6x and Honor Play I was thinking of buying the Honor 9x pro but after I found out that it did not support Google Play I opted out. So then I began researching other brands and I came across the Galaxy M21. The features were promising but the negative reviews regarding network held me back. By chance I happened to come across a video in YouTube regarding LTE / 3g / 2g settings in the M21. Bingo! I knew where the problem was. So without waiting any longer I ordered this smartphone.After receiving it and using it for a few days I am glad my decision was correct. In fact the call quality and  network reception of the M21is much better than the Honor phones which I have been using for a long time.The reason why this network issue arises is because after inserting the Sim and starting the M21 the OS of this phone selects the LTE/3G/2G (auto connect) option in Mobile networks by default. I am using Jio Sim and Jio is only 4G. Now if by chance the 4G signal becomes a little weak the phone will search for 3G or 2G signal and in doing so the call or network signal may drop or get cut altogether since Jio is only 4G. So if I select the LTE only option the phone will latch on to the 4G signal even if it becomes a little weak.So for those who have Jio Sim and have network issues I will suggest that (1) select LTE only option in Mobile networks (2) In Access Point Names open 3 vertical dots and Reset to default and immediately reboot or restart the phone. I hope this helps.

  Just one word. It's best. Purchased it in 15 may 2020 at 12,999 till now phone's performance is superb. Guys don't go for realme or redmi or vivo, oppo.

  I got Samsung M21 in 13999/-  Comparing to this price rangePros- 1) Display is good.2) The camera is good in daylight...Cons-1) while charging, Heats up like a hell.2) battery is on documents 6000mah but in real performance definitely not 6000mah3) Camera quality in low light is not good4) while surfing on net again half upper portion of the phone gets heated.5) The processor is average6) Phone hangs even searching in contacts then no keys work only power key ..switch off and then switch on.Afterall, compairing to other companies at this price range phone is ok.

  19 July 2020, 1:45AM : This product has some ""MAJOR NETWORK ISSUES"". None of the SIMs (Jio, BSNL, Idea) are getting network on the phone (-113dBm 0 asu). The signal always shows either ""NO SERVICE"" or ""EMERGENCY CALLS ONLY"". I've put all my day diagnosing the problem but it still persists. I'm really frustated now. No doubt about other features, the phone has really good camera, speed and sound.PS: I want my problem not only to be addressed first but also provide a solution to it ASAP. Contact me whenever required, take my data from Amazon Database.

  When I start hotspot in this phone, and try to connect laptop to it, it fails. When I make hotspot with any other phone, my laptop connects instantly, but only with this phone's hotspot, it keeps on rotating the cursor, or says ""can't connect to this network"". I need urgent help with this otherwise I will have to get it replaced.

"

  1. I used for the last 120 days in according to my usage battery backup is good. It's good but not like 6000mah at all.2. Its SAmoled screen is best in this price range(best of this cost), Design-wise ergonomically fit in our hands.3. The processor is powerful but at the same time i have noticed some occasional lags.4. Heating issue detected sometimes in front camera areas but don't worry about because it's not high.5. Sometimes fingerprint sensor not working fastly otherwise it's good.According to cost-wise, this is the best mobile, especially from Samsung.

  Facing some issues in network connection. 4G network is not stable whereas it was stable in my old phone. Otherwise it is a very good phone.

  I have never been a fan of customized Android phones, and have mostly preferred phones with the stock Android. I was looking to a new phone because the manufacturer of my earlier phone did not support security updates that were required for my work apps / email.This is my second Samsung phone, after the 2010-launched Nexus S. Compared to earlier phones, this feels a little big and is heavier as well. Perhaps it could be due to the battery. So far, there is nothing to complain about, but I would have liked the price to be comparable to the Redmi models. I got this one for ~ Rs. 14K, which the seller claims is at a Rs. 2K discount. I wouldn't have bothered to pay Rs. 16K for sure. The Redmi Note 9 comes in at around Rs. 12K for similar configuration. I would have bought the Redmi phone, but the reviews made me feel suspicious about it (especially about the ads being displayed).Some stand out points:§ Made in India: I didn't have a constraint on this one, but hey, if it's made in India, then, why not.§ Selfie camera: Samsung says it us 20 MP. It is definitely better than other models I have been using. (Note: I almost always prefer phones below Rs. 15K)§ Android 10: This itself was my constraint. I was looking only for Android 10 phones. One of the most important things for me was the support for dark mode.§ Reputed manufacturer: Well, Samsung is the leader. So, can't go much wrong with this brand.§  Minor irritants:§§ The setup process feels as though using the Samsung's Smart Switch app is the only way to get data from your existing phone. If you do not want to use it, the setup wizard is slightly different than the stock Android version. If you have a backup of the previous Android phone on Google, that can be used as well. However, setup takes a long time as compared to the stock Android version.§§ The location of the back and recent app buttons on the navigation bar are swapped. I had to install a button remapper app to swap the 2 buttons.§§ Samsung tries to push its own apps and its account sign up. I avoided it like plague, and deleted all the unnecessary apps.§§ I prefer the Nova launcher app. I feel at home after installing this app.In short, after some customization, it was back to what I wanted.

  The only feature I liked in this phone is the ringtone.  Camera not that great. The user feel is missing and for me it just like my 10.or E with negligible added features. The phone is overpriced at 15500 (got the mobile delivery on 12th June).  Heavy to hold and inconvenient to handle. Worst part is  Amazon doesn't have a return policy and suggested me to do a exchange instead with another brand of my choice (with heavy deduction of course). Amazon accept a return for the mobile case though and processed for refund, the mobile is lying with me and wondering what to do with it.  Am just not too happy with my choice of purchase on Amazon. I would henceforth make a resolution to buy from a mobile store after physically checking a  display piece.

  Best Phone to Buy Under 15k Range! Samsung Brand And After Sales Service is Great. Phone Having 48mp Quad Cameras Which Clicks Great Natural Pictures than other Brands. sAmoled Display will Increase your Video Movies And Streaming Experience. Battery You Have to Charge once in a Day for heavy Uses As well. Just for Information, The Con is Phones Back which is made of plastic, you'll see scratches if you don't use back cover for long. That's the Only Con I Found! But on other hand No Brand Gives You Full HD sAmoled Display, 6000mAh Battery, Natural Cameras and After Sales Service in This Price Segment! Happy to Suggest...

  If you are looking for gaming mobile, then m21 shouldn't be your choice.Pros- Only display and brand nameCons- camera is third class, I was using realme 3 pro and 16mp camera is way better than m21's camera.Selfie camera is pathetic, working like 2mpAfter update camera has been worst I guess.Processor is not good, as game with normal graphics is lagging, I think pubg is not possible in this device.Ram management  is pathetic.Battery drains quicker compare to 6000mah.I played car simulator, believe me guys l, graphics are pathetic even in when kept on high.Dolby atmos, a joke from samsung, my realms 3 pro was way better in sound output when it comes to device speaker or earphones.Clarity of camera in auto mode and pro mode is worst.Don't buy guys, go for better option, seriously telling you.Don't believe  in good reviews. I am giving you honest review of this product.Only buy if you don't play games and you don't bother about Camera

  Buying this product is a waste of money. The single phone cost is 15000 rupees but the quality and performance is very poor. There is no cover no glass with the phone and when purchase from the market  its cost approaches to 15500  rupees. Battery performance, Ram and camera quality are very poor and showing 6000mah,6gb,4 8-8-5 megapixels which are beyond limits actual they are not so. Other features are very less in comparison other quality setsI am not interested in this product

  Samsung M21 is  Manufactured in India and even brand is from S.Korea. I am very happy to move my mind from ""Xiaomi/mi to Samsung"". This is not a war, lesson for China :)I have pledge to boycott all China products!Here is the review:Good phone with long battery life, the feeling of touch is amazing. Value for money.

  Here is my review on the new samsung m21.I'm using this smartphone from 2 months so I can give my comment to help you guys make up your decision. I categorise my review based on the following points: (a) Built Quality (b) Display (c) Camera (d) Performance (e) Software (f) Battery(A) Build quality: It's a nice looking phone with a standard build quality nothing fancy on the back. Plain standardised back side with glossy finish but very well built keeping in mind it has 6000 mah battery. It's feels quite light in hands. It's a sturdy phone and it can handle if it accidentally it drops sometime. If you want to get fully packed phone in this price range it's a good phone to buy with this build quality.(B) Display: We all know samsung make great displays so here also it's a 6.4 inch water drop notch mailed display which is amazing in this price range. I bought this phone only for its great display and cameras. I mostly watch videos on my phone and it's a great experience. Even the touch response is also very good in samsung phones. Amoled display and 6000 mah battery is a great combination.(C) Camera: Camera is it's highlight in this price range. Samsung captures very good photos with a good balance of colors and natural sharp photos. The colors in photos are not over saturated. It takes very good photos. M21 has 20 mp front cam and 48 mp back camera which takes amazing photos. Samsung live focus provide some amazing features. Samsung UI is brilliant providing u some amazing features in camera.(D) Performance: Samsung's performance is quite balanced with exynos 9611 series processor. I don't do much gaming but for occasional gaming it will not disappoint you but specifically for gaming you can check out some other products with better processors in this price range. But for day to day usage it performs good and samsung hi provides great performance with this processor. So you are getting a good camera bigger battery and sufficient powerful processor.(E) Software: Samsung UI is great no ads altogether and has great features which are really useful. You can check some videos on features for samsung UI. I like the Samsung standardised UI which is great easy to use and smooth.(F) Battery: For battery it's a 6000 mah battery so you can expect a 2 days battery life for normal user and 1 day full use for heavy users who do a lot of gaming movie and videos watching. But for battery you can give 7 star and samsung did a great work by keeping the phone light weigh also with this massive battery inbuilt. So it's a great phone in this price range. Fully packed samsung phone.

  Phone is very good. But charger is not up to the mark. It takes 2.5 hours toh charge from 1%  to 100%. So plz change this charger. Although performance wise ph is superb. In 15000 rs range . Ultimate ph

"
"

  the battery is too good and pubg works fine too.i reccomend not going for brands like mi realme and other chinese brandsbloatware free (adfree) one ui is even better than stock android. camera is fine too.Another thing is that dont go for the realme 6 or 6 pro for its 90 hz display because its ips lcd.amoled 60 hz is way better than that.

"
"

  First time buying a Samsung phone and absolutely loved the experience.......the phone is 9/10 overall...The feel in the hand is really premium even with polycarbonate back...I've held glass phone and this phone doesn't feel any cheaper....Samsung didn't make any compromises with phone ...my only complain is the fingerprint scanner it takes a little swipe to unlock rather than a tap...I'm not quite used to this.....the performance in public is great too.  ...I reccomend gfx tool to achieve true 60 fps possible to GPU optimization in premium gfx tool ......the best thing about this phone is the battery ....... it's a beast and nothing can beat it in this price range....I get minimum of 8hrs of screen time in my heavy usage with the phone playing games and using social media apps.....its my new favourite phone...thx to samsung

  Your representative visited at my home in connection with complaint regarding fault in my phone.  But till now no reply or action has been initiated to redress my complaint.  Please do the needful at the earliest as my business is adversely affected due to faulty mobile phone.  After this request if no relief is provided to me I would have  only option of legal action in term of newly introduced consumer protection act.

  I was looking for a smartphone with good battery life for using it as hotspot, all other features were secondary for me. I am satisfied with the needs but I have to mention below thingsPros:Battery is good as per 5 days of usage with 30 + default google appsScreen is bright and very good to look atno lag for normal apps (im not a game fan) ConsWorst ever camera i used on a smartphone. 48MP is just the size of image, quality of what it captures is patchy and bad images. Camera quality compared to the advertisement is very bad.Heating issue when screen is on while charging.

"
"

  First when I got this phone I found it has issues with mic. Hence I placed a request for replacing the item. Second time also I faced the same issue. When I am the caller, the receiver is able to hear my voice clearly. But when I am the receiver, caller is not able to hear me properly. I need to talk louder in order to be audible. I returned the phone again. I would want Samsung to check this issue and work on it. Otherwise all the other features in this phone are value for money.

  Perfect mobile phone with more storage space, Excellent sound quality with Dolby atmos ,extended battery life ..I tried to use full night to watch OTT web series.. morning 42% of battery life is pending.. if you keep volume less than 50% we can't hear any sound ..company should improve this .. we can't keep volume with 100% at all time... Inbuilt functionality of install 2 social apps like WhatsApp ,FB etc., my suggestion .. if you are looking for phone less 15000 with so many features. This is one of the best model to look:)

"
"

  I got the delivery yesterday. My last phone was Poco F1. M21 is a good phone at this price point. as its a big battery with 15W charging capacity it will take anywhere between 2.5 to 3 hrs to charge but once charged it can easily go for 2 days for non-gamer. Camera is good at this price point.The best thing is its Samsung, which has good after service and if you take samsung care + home pickup and drop. for M21 2 years the price of care+ is Rs1349 with everything covered except theft

"

  I am writing this review after using this phone for more than a month. The box comes with M21 handset, Power adapter, USB cable and ejection pin. Earphones are not included in it. The battery performance is quite good, it takes not more than 2 hrs to charge completely from zero to 100% and on medium usage, can last upto 2 days. The phone handset is very light weight as compared to M10, M20 which is very heavy to carry because of heavy weight of battery. One good thing is that the M21 handset as well charger or power adapter is made in India. As of now, the overall performance is good, battery output is efficient though there is some heating of device during charging, only sometimes & not always. Camera quality is good too but in natural light settings. I need to use this phone for some more time to further write detailed updated review but at the end of the day, Samsung can be trusted for their phones.

   I Ordered this product on 28th july 2020 and recevied the delivery packet by 30th july 5:00pm (Delivery speed was good though.)I payed the order amt to delivery guy and after receiving the payment, he handed over me the phone. And full of curiosity i opened the delivery packet in front of  delivery guy.what i found is that phone box has all the accessories perfectly But the sad part is phone itself was missing.I mean did i just paid 13999 rupees for a samsung charger and a data cable and ofcourse the sim ejecting tool.Just warning you guys , maybe you won't even get the charger , data cable and sim ejecting tool .Be Careful While paying at this Product or even any other product from Amazon.So, this is the real face of amazon india services . this is their customer satisfaction and after sales service.I dont know that who was faulty at this , it can be the seller , delivery agency , or warehouse staff(as it was FBA product) . But the responsiblity of managing all of this goes to Amazon Only and that's why they charge high comission fees from sellers.

  Biometrics is good i.e. fingerprint sensor and face recognition works very smooth. Phone performance is smooth , do not lag.But :-1. 6000mAh do not run for more than 24 hours in normal usage, no games, no music, song, just net crowsing over wifi.2. Camera is 48 MP but the sensors behind it make that 48mp pretty useless, the moment you zoom post taking 48mp photo (3:4) you will find out that it is not 48 mp, as pixel started splitting.3. Personally I did not like UI, so switched to Microsoft UI and that works smooth.

  The seems ok. Plastic built phone. Camera is ok. Charger and cable seems poor in quality. the packaging was so poor. thank god that the product reached home safely. only a plastic cover as available. company not including any earphone, back cover or screen guard, nothingis present. its my first with with the phone.

  Amazon deserves the innumerable accolades for delivering this phone in this maze of lockdown.  This is ineffable service from Amazon. This is great and uncomparable phone. THANK YOU SAMSUNG..outstanding performance and extraordinary battery life..

"
"

  The phone doesn't even turned on and It's not getting charged also. Unfortunately there is no return or refund policy for this. If you want to return this item you have to install one smartchek app and diagnose the issue, otherwise Amazon will arrange an inspection service at your delivery address and you'll get a replacement only if the technician is convinced. Amazon is simply cheating it's customers. Never expected this kind of discourteous service from Amazon.

"
"

  All of you guys know what are the plus points. Let me tell you the negative points-1. Camera is kind of ok ok, I have Realme 2 pro 16 mp sony sensor.. both are kind of same. But Samsung's hdr and dynamic range is superb.2. Battery not optimized. Maybe next update will fix this issue. Screen on time 8 to 9 hours. No gaming.3. Samsung running on February security patch. But my Realme 2 pro 1.5 year's old device running on latest security patch. Samsung's update policy is worst.4. Sometimes UI freezes just for 1 second. Not an issue of processor. UI needs more improvement.Hope it helps! Cheers!

  Batterry is verry verry very poor

  Previous generations of Samsung phones used to provide better quality though. This one provides excellent specs for the price, but doesn't come with earphones and its charging cable is very short. I have to use a USB extension cable to make up for that. Operation is real smooth and lots of space. Camera is okay, battery is great but that's the ""standard"" in the age of Mi. Fingerprint reader frequently fails. Lots of features I enjoyed in the older Galaxy J7-6 are missing though. Thankfully almost all my customizations are preserved thanks to Smart Switch. Still for a Samsung phone it has too much bloatware. Thankfully I am able to disable all of them. Guess that's why the low price, I'm content with it, with this RAM, storage and battery it'll make overall usage comfortable.

  Review after 10 days..1.battery life is awesome.5/52.charging time is 2.30hrs from 0 to 100%.4.5/53.camera quality is nice. 4.5/54. processors is good for multi tasking but not for hard core gaming however causual games work fine 4.5/5.5.no network/call/data issues. 5/5display is awesome.5/5 no doubt.6.fingerprint sensor slowed down after 10 days 3/5.Overall al best budget phone but the delivery experience was horrible the delivery person was very rude to behave and even refused to come at the parking of the building...i could have rated 1 star but i don't want to spoilnthe reputation of the such big  company like SamsungYOU CAN ALSO SEE THE QUALITY OF INVOICE RECEIVED.....😡😡

  Overall seams good,I gave 2 star for battery life,Inspite of power charger it's take too long to get full charge. Also drain fast even optimization of power consumption ie reducing brightness, background data off etc. Although battery is 6000mah but doesn't seams inside more than 3500 mah.If you don't use much wifi, bluetooth , video than battery may survive longer and meet your expectations.Look and touch feel, speed 4gb Ram good thats why 3 star.

  6GB RAM, 128GB storage, colour black1. When recording slow motion videos...there isalways flicker on screen.2. Camera is just awesome3. Battery survives one and half day......which is bad because till now I m using it only for WhatsApp and call......I wonder what will happen when I use it for gaming4. Heats when i charge....not expected from a world class company phoneSuggestionsIf you are low on budget then only select this model ......otherwise go for some other model of Samsung or any other brand.....by adding few more bucks....

  It's a very nice mobile phone considering the price range and configuration it comes in. I'm using it for a little over 2months now.PRO's:1. Has amazing  camera  quality.2.Battery live is good as well..lasts me for a little over 24 hours. With YouTube, Shopping and other basic use.3. Speakers are pretty loud..exceeds expectations.4.Font and other icons display is larger than usual...will be useful  for the elderly folks.5. Over all look and feel is good.CON's:1. It's not fast charging as claimed. It takes round 2 to 3 hrs to full charge with wifi and other apps running. Else it takes 2hour to fully charge with all apps closed & wifi turned off.2.Fringer print recognition is not accurate,it atleast takes 3 -4 attempts to recognize it.3.Too big to fit in pocket. Uncomfortable to ride he bike with it in the pocket.4.Body is delicate-my phone slipped from my hand without any force..it has a dent on the backside.

  Display is the highlight. Best display on budget phone.Battery life is acceptable above 1 day of normal use. Charging takes much more time.Dont buy it for playing pubg. Battery heats up and after one hour very high frame drops and frequent restarting.Camera is way better than any other phones in the range. Skin tones and colour reproduction is somewhat natural.Overall good buy in the price range except for gaming.

  I'm reviewing my Samsung Galaxy M21 phone after 15 days usage & If someone tells me to say something about it in minimum words then I'll say """"It is Awesome"""". It is a perfect NON-CHINESE phone in mid range for me, I was too confused about it even after purchasing it but when i used this, I'm loving it.Pros:1. It's huge 6000mah battery survives 36 to 40 hrs in normal usage.2. Super AMOLED display having very nice colour contrast and all.3. Camera, it's selfie camera having wide angle photo option & flash too and rear cameras also clicks very nice pictures, even in night both the cameras satisfies me and are very good in this price range.4. Latest Android 105. OneUI 2.0 support which having many enexpected features like you can use more than one apps simultaneously on single screen by minimising them, and we can generate a floating button for screenshot capture, screen off & many more functions, you can hide apps, and zipped apps for saving battery and many more.6. It's Exynos 9611 processor gives a smooth performance, no lag noticed in 15 days usage.7. And one of the major factor is that it is a Non-Chinese mobile.Iske alawa bohot kuchh hai isme jo maine expect bhi nahi kiya tha.Cons:1. One thing I don't like in it is it's cheap Plastic body which is susceptible to scratches but you can manage with it by protecting it with a back cover.2. It takes approx. 3 hrs to fully charge.Bus PUBG nahi khela maine isme. So I can't say anything about that.👍Otherwise, It completely satisfies me.😍😍😍

  Review after using 10 days..This Mobile has lot of issues..1. Network reception- This is really  lower than other mobiles..  There is low network  in my house but other mobiles work perfectly.. In this mobile, network i m getting is almost negligible..2. Battery Issue - company  claims  it to have 6000MH, but it drains too fast. I have compared with my 2 years old MI phone(4000mh). This phone drains little faster than mi. So what's the point of claiming  6000 mh3. Voice audio quality - quality  of the voice which you listen in your ear while talking to some is really bad like a cheaper phone's. Mostly  you need to be very attentive  to listen.4. Heating issue - And I have also read the reviews  that people are also having  heating  issues. Though  I don't have this issue still..

  After using samsung m21 and verifying  its features I reviewed as fallowsLiked features.  1. sAmoled  display  2. Processor/interface  3. Finger print sensation time, face  recognition  time.  4. 6000mah battery life  5. Light weightSpecifications which does not meet expectations are as fallows (i.e  defects)  1. Heats up while charging  2. Under 10k phone we are getting  18w fast charging facility why not in  this case?  We get 15w fast charge  facility here but it's feel like we are  charging our battery from past 1  day  3.camera does not satisfied expectation  Lag in frame rates. Cameras are not  at their best  4. We are buying phone at  it's best  price but company fails to provide  its protection by avoiding temper  guard,backcover.  5. Low sound enhancement quality  6. Fails to provide premium back  design.By reviewing all features.I conclude it's better to buy other reliable cellphone under same price.If you are a samsung lover go for it.If not go through other device features and grab a better among one.Think twice before investing  some buks on cellphone. Grab better one .

"

  It is the worst mobile I ever had. Company claims saying Gorrilla glass 5 protection is not justified as its screen broken with a single slip while sitting in the chair from my jeans pocket. Further no one is there to listen. We feel so bad that in India where there is world's largest market of mobile consumers, still there is no best mobile which can compete these Chinese cheap and best mobiles. I love my India. So will wait....

"
"

  The battery is not actually 6000mAh but slightly less which is around 5830mAh the battery comes around for 18 hours on intensive usage which is quite good for a phone on this budget. I love the texture of the phone. But it slips a lot when used without a case better go for a spigen case which is really good combination with the phone. The interface of the phone is quite simple and very easy to use . For people with smaller hands it is quite hard to reach the top with single hand . The camera is great but it goes hazy for night shots.Overall it is a great phone .

"
"

  I had to wait for long for this mobile as I was told that this is getting sold out very soon. And indeed it stands upto its reputation. To sum up, solid built quality, excellent display,  fast processor make it stands apart from its Chinese competitors. Don't Get fooled by its specs which say that it has polycarbonate body. Its rock solid chassis justifies its price. I'm not a gamer but I bought it for my mom.  So it's perfectly alright. The battery life reminds me of old ""Hero Honda "" ad of "" just fill it and forget it"" . The speaker is not that too loud but quality of music through headphones is very good especially when you switch on Dolby atmos. I used sennheiser px80 to test it. So please don't waste time and grab it.

  I was apprehensive about Samsung phones offered at this price but just to teach Chinese a lesson I opted for Samsung galaxy M 21 and it didn't dispoint me at all.Followings are pros and cons of this mobile1. ROM RAM are much much more .  I got more than 3gb of free RAM space and more than 115 gb of memory available.2. Camera and selfie camera are class apart and I felt that rich detailing coming back to pic which was lacking in Chinese mobiles.. "" camera quality - ⭐⭐⭐⭐""3. Huge 6000mAH battery is really long lasting.. one first full recharge it took 2 days to come to 30 level even with continuous uses. ""⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ For battery.4. Display is super rich. Can be easily distinguished from othe phones mostly Chinese.. ⭐⭐⭐⭐.5. Finger print reader is super fast ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐.6. It's light weight and super amolded screen is eye catching ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐.Easy to grip and premium looking.ConsSome common features are lacking which are otherwise given in most phonesNo net speed  indicators. I just downloaded one small app from store and now it's working fine.No option for zooming in when using 48 MP cameras.. however still shots are super rich..No screen guard, back cover provided with phone.Overall it's a gud buy at this price range..Samsung is trying to recapture its original lost out to Chinese filthy mobiles.. earlier it was not offering this much of features with less pricing. However after Noida plant Samsung is in no mood to spare Chinese mobile companies.Request to all my friends.. pls find one suitable phone from samsung or other indian companies as per ur requirement. However in absence of good phones from from india we can give Samsung a try. All price range and ROM and RAM options available. Pls go for Samsung phones

  I bought M21 (4gb, 64gb), delivered on 27th june. Notice a distinct yellow tint on display (whites are ivory). have tried multiple options: vivid mode- white balance, rgb tweak, adaptive brightness, dark mode, blue light filter off, no success. Tried to search a bit, looks a like lot of people are facing yellow tint issues with Android 10 UI 2.0. Samsung: is there a fix for this?. I have a S8+ (which luckily I cant upgrade to android 10). Screen tone of S8+ (whites are whites!) and M21 (ivory whites!) are quite different. Apart from this, proximity sensor working is intermittent, voice quality on video call is pathetic! Samsung, what do I do with this phone- return option not appearing/ replacement is showing..that too if smartchk app finds something wrong (these problems are not even listed). So all doors closed? Of all the problems, worst is the display..causing severe eye strain and headaches. As of now using at near zero brightness level. Suggestion to prospective buyers: pls look elsewhere! Samsung: please suggest a solution (for what its worth, I am regular Samsung customer, using 5 devices- mobiles/ appliances as of now). This one was a real disappointment! Kindly help!

  I got this device yesterday.Initial great impressions, sturdy phone a bit on the heavier edge because of the huge battery.I am rating a perfect 5 for the amazon packing and service provided.I am happy with the device, its pretty smooth with the new Samsung One UI, lot of great features and improvement on the older samsungsThis is the first time i have decided to buy a Samsung phone. I never bought them because i never liked Samsung's UI.So overall happy but a 3 star rating for the device because of the defect inside one of the camera lens i don't know how that happened. But i am not happy seeing it. I know this is a low-budget phone. But i do not expect such carelessness from samsung. I know its a small thing and i can still take photos but i don't feel good that it's there.I wanted this phone urgently, i have use for it. So i cannot even replace this phone because I need it. Once the lockdown is lifted i will have to visit the service center.Such a good device. But a small thing that ruins the experience Samsung. I don't know how quality check misses this.

"
"

  Ultimate phone.Excellent finger print reader, display, battery back up is fantastic, speed of processor is like bullet, camera quality is excellent better than other brand s phone of even higher range, memory is more than enough, in this budget this mobile is incomparable with any other brand.I am writing this review after six months of usage.Must buy..

"
"

  This phone is very much similar to Samsug M30s. Some few differences include 20 MP front camera and android 10 in M21. First I bought M30s four month before and now I bought M21 because the price was lower by 2000/- compare to M30s.The phone performs decently in almost all aspects except battery backup. The M21 is giving highly disappointing battery backup. Even though Samsung claims that it is a 6000 mAh battery, it won't last for more than One & half day with normal usage like phone calling, messaging, WA and some banking or office apps.My M30s with same 6000 mAh, was giving (I lost it and so I bought M21) me the battery backup of 3 to 4 days leisurely.If battery life matters for you, don't go for M21, instead buy M30s only.

"
"

  not satisfied at all. its front cam is pathetic which has filter by default, my redmi 5A, 3 year old phone worth 6999 takes much much MUCH BETTER photos than this disgusting ''Samsung smart phone''. There was an issue of switching on of hotspot which was sorted out after contacting the Samsung agent for around 39 min.  These phones are refurbished phones and not brand new phones which i didn't know and we cant return it as its not in the  policy, we can only replace them. LOL. well.....i just wanted a budget smart phone not COMPROMISE, which now i have to. My personal suggestion-if anyone wants to buy Samsung, buy it from the store not online coz these are not new and would definitely create problems.

"
"

  1. I put the phone on charging, but it ran into a boot loop for no reason. Then I opened in factory mode. But after choosing to restart, it would again go in boot loop. Then I choose safe mode. But it did not come back to normal mode despite many efforts and restarts. The only way to restart it in normal mode was to format it. So, I had to.With my experience in the first month, I knew the phone is not stable. Nor it is reliable. So configured important folders for auto backup on Onedrive so I won't lose important photos and Data again.2. The battery is ok, yet I think not 6000mah. My 3 years old phone with 4000mah used to run for the same one day. It runs a few extra hours than the old one.Rest is no issue.

"
"

  After 1 month of usage this r my observations :)Pros:1) Excellent screen2) Great battery backup (u will have to tweak some settings to get the best battery backup).3) Decent camera performance.4) fast fingerprint sensor.5) Non-Chinese brand.Cons:1) Average processor.2) Poor Low light camera performance.3) Poor pubg performance.4) 15W fast charger is not enough takes around 2.5 hours to fully charge the phone.5) No protective case in the box.Overall: If u r looking for a reliable Non-Chinese phones for day to day tasks and light gaming then just go for this phone.

  Face detecter -*****Fingerprint- *****Processor-*****Camera- ***** very much satisfy with camera performance..Gaming- 4gb is not for gaming..But as a multitasker this phone will satisfy you....Charger 'taking 2 hours to fully charged the phone..Overall phone performance eith battery backup os amazing... as per my personal opinion I am using this phone gor last 2 week....i noticed no problem means no lagging no screen burn .....worth it..value for money

  After 3 days of use I am posting this, bought this phone for my wife who was using Redmi Note 5.Small things which is available in competition products with lesser or same price makes lot of difference. After 6 years of experience with Xiaomi we did lot of Research to change and chosen Samsung as preferred one.But am little disappointed with the performance here is pro's & cons.Pro's:1. Slim and very light to handle2. Audio output3. Lot of features inbuilt4. Battery backup ( comes 1&half day for moderate use)5. WiFi direct callingCons:1. >2 hrs charging time2. Doesn't feels like 48 megapixel & 20 megapixel front camera.3. Screen notifications are worst, you don't have screen led light blinking when any notifications come, so everytime you have to touch the screen to check for notifications.4.  Doesn't provide back case which competition does.5. Plastic back panel looks like ordinary phone for which you have to spend 16k.Overall not fully satisfied with this phone. As mentioned Samsung, has a big brand should small things should be implemented.

  The Samsung M21 is a budget smartphone with professional features at a pocket friendly price. The smartphone has 48 MP camera that does justice to photos and videos. The phone has a dual sim which means it is like carrying two phones in one, without the need to lug two physical phones. The phone has VoLTE capability and supports the latest 4G SIM cards and protocols. The massive battery is a boon for those who need to keep on ""chatting/talking non-stop"". The fast charger supplied with the phone is amazing. It charges the massive battery from 0% to 40% in about 30 minutes. So when time is pricy, the Samsung M21 helps you to get on the move with the limited time and its quick charge ability. The fingerprint reader is located on the rear side and is extremely fast in responding to fingerprint recognition. It is a great buy at the given price. Go for it.

  This product is good..I am student who got this phone for online classes every day  for 4hrs and 2hr 30min everyday tution plus my space 2hrsIt last for this full time.Continuously usingIt does get hotBut cools in some timeIt's been a more since I am using it perfect for me only thing no clipboard but downloaded it from Google keyboardCharging give an hour starting it loses it battery after a week it gets better and after the update on the phone its much better.I purchased a 4gb as well as a 6gbThis review is for the 6gbAnd this 6gb phone will last for 4to5 yearsAnd 4gb for 2to3 years6gb has more space than 4gb hence lifespan moreHope this gives u some idea about the phone..this is my honest reviewI hope this is helpful

"

  I love this phone and currently have no complaints regarding it. But I would love even more if its sound quality would be better. The only thing I hate about this phone is the plastic body which seems too brittle to break, but it's quite strong enough. Its 6000 mAh battery is too long-lasting and could easily give you a battery backup of 1.5 days. I even play games on it and it can easily handle COD mobile and PUBG mobile on medium settings. But if you want to play on high-end settings, I won't recommend this phone. I got this deal at 12699 and compared to the price I have paid, I am completely satisfied. Thank you Samsung and Amazon for the best delivery experience as expected.

  An amazing phone, been using it for almost 20 days.Absolutely no unwanted Bloatware like the Chinese phones, an amazing Battery which lasts almost upto 2 days, with continuous WiFi Google meet and Zoom calls, Fair amount of E mails, Surfing and online streaming.Super fast Finger print scanner, very easy to setup. Solid build quality, with good look and feel of the phone.Good camera for the price point almost matches my iPhone XR. Super fast charging with Type C. Go for the 128gb version it makes more sense.This is any day better than the cheap Chinese copies on sale today.And oh yes forgot to mention this is 100% Made in India

  REVIEWING after 1 month.Bought it for INR 12,699. It took around 2 hrs to 2.30 hrs to get fully charged. Amazing display. Sound is equally good. I didn't try installing heavy gaming apps. Camera app has lot of features. Worth for money. That's all I would say.Pros:👍 Type C cable with fast charging.👍 Camera is excellent[support super slow motion videos].👍 Decent battery.👍 Super AMOLED display.👍 Comes with android 10.Cons:👎 USB cable is little short.👎 No earphone.👎 Lot of preinstalled apps like helo, tiktok,...

  I have bought this smartphone around 3 month ago. Below is my experiencePros.1. Smooth amold display will blow your heart. You will definently like display and color of display.2. 6000mah Battary will provide you breakthrough performance. You dont need to charge again and again like other phone. Charge once and use whole day.3. Camera Obviously  48 mp back camera and 20mp front will provide you amazing photography experience i am not good in clicking pictures. Hence i uploaded some of photos. I belive you can do better than me.4. It have 4GB RAM so you can do multitasking eseily. No lag while playing PUBG or COD whith high graphics setting.5. If have game launcher which is amazing feature providing by samsung. Like it will track time spending on a single game, while playing if someone calling you will get very short popup to receive call or not.6. Again amazon sevice did great work even in lockdown. (5 out of 5).7. Manufacturing in india. And samsung relible brand.Cons.1. Charging time is too long even it have fast charging still you have to give 2hour to 2 hour 30 minute for full charging.2. I didnt like back side look but i still bought beacuse of feature and brand value and pricing.So overall my final rating is 4.7 out of 5. You should go for it.

"

  The phone has these positive sides :1. Great display. AMOLED is hands down better than any other technology.2. Great Battery life.3. Great software experience with ONEUI.4. Great form factor with low weight. samsung made the phone completely out of plastic to adjust for the wt of the battery.5. Type C charger.The bad parts:1. Speaker output could have been better.And that's it. It is a great phone with a great display- the actual thing u tend to look at all day round.GET IT and be HAPPY.

  I have been using this phone for the last one month and till now I did not see any technical defect in it.  This is Samsung's best budget phone so far.  I would like to give it a full 5 stars out of 5, with excellent emulated display, great processor, battery performance and camera quality.

  I bought this phone for my mother but used it for couple of weeks until I orderd Vivo z1x for myself. My mother is a casual gamer and plays light games. She also watches lots of videos and stream movies. And according to her needs I found this phone a perfect match at an unbelievable price (12699). I was looking for an amoled screen as it causes less strain on eyes.Display : Display is super awesome. Very bright and accurately colorful. I use Vivo z1x (Super amoled) and Samsung's display is far superior than of Vivo's. Daylight visibility is very good.Battery : Battery backup is excellent. It is easily giving 9 to 10 hours of screen on time. Charge it once and use it entire day without worry. Buttttt there is a major con, charging speed. It's 15w charger charges the phone very sluggishly. It takes almost 2 hours and 45 minuts to charge it fully.Camera : Camera performance is mediocre. It isn't great. Photos are good in daylight condition but things get bad in low light. Selfie Camara is also mediocre. Considering the price, Camara performance justifies the price.Sound : Speaker output is decently loud and clear. Headphone output is outstanding (because of Dolby atmos support).User interface : Phone runs on One UI android 10. It is majorly seamless with no lag. One UI is nice and feels premium. It has many customization options. There are no annoying ads or recommendations.Gaming : Phone performs excellent in light gaming. No major lag. Since my mother plays light games only, it serves the purpose well. Buttttt if you are a heavy gamer, please skip it without hesitation.Network : There is no issue in network or calling. Video streaming is also excellent. Good network reception.Cons :1. Sometimes finger print sensor is hit and miss. It annoys, you just keep rubbing your finger on the sensor and nothing happens.2. If you are a heavy user (who uses lots of games and apps) then phone will not feel smooth.3. Charging speed is very poor. In this fast lifestyle, it's very hard to manage with slow charging.4. Mediocre camera performance.5. Face unlock is bit slow and doesn't perform good in low light.Conclusion : I wanted to buy a phone for my mother and this phone fulfilled all the needs such as Amoled screen, big battery, decent processor, good sound output. Camera wasn't my priority. Overall very satisfied with the product.

  Just purchased this phone as i had no other option as i dont support chinese product anymore.The picture quality of the phone is great but the phone starts hanging while using whatsapp. Even after using it for 15min the phone becomes heated . To disconnet the call you need to tap twice on the cancel  button.I had used Samasung Galaxy J7 few years back and it was my worst experience ever. I thought Samsung being such a big company might have improved the quality after years. But i was wrong.When you spend around 14k-15k you expect a gorilla glass but it's the disadvantage with M21. My phone fell once and the screen cracked. My older phone K9 note fell many times but nothing happened coz it had gorilla glass. Pity on such a poor design configuration by samsung.Strong suggestion to buyers....Never go for Samsung , keep it as a last option to buy.

  This my review after 4 days of purchase.  I bought this for my mother who is a teacher. She wanted a phone with screen recorder. As all classes are online for the past few months due to Covid teachers r taking online classes and submitting the same to their heads. As her old phone did not support recording on 2 mics I had purchased this phone as it is a non Chinese best brand. Butto my shock it does not support 2 mics and for her it is a waste. All other mid-range chinese phones support recording which is in built. I did not expect this from such a good brand.  This forces us to buy Chinese phones though we want to boycott Chinese products. I hope Samsung brings in a new update to correct this problem.

  Regualr updates are required to boost system and software  performance.Camera is awesome rear and front.Functions are smooth and buttery .Watching movies and videos are very pleasant.But Some of the bloatware and third party apps  like Helo,likee,etc are yuck and must not be preinstalled. Thank God We can uninstall  them.Go for it .You wont regret except for regular android updates. only Feb month software update is provided so far by default. DONT KNOW if they provide regular security update or not.But it's  performance is by far smooth and well.While Doing DUO video call I felt heating of phone.Let's  see if it is improved in next security update.Samsung should provide headphones,back cover, tempered  glass with phones at their end.Regards,Edit:31may 2020Yesterday  took 30/40 photos and my phone Galaxy M21 appeared hot.Photos were quite good.What astonished me is this phone's  battery management .It generally takes three days to discharge.Actually I am a moderate user So It's expected but want the same performance in future. Samsung's own EXYNOS processor needs overhauling in comparison  to qualcom snapdragon and media  tech..Will add further information in due course02 june2020YouTube playback is sometimes stuck which I Experienced two three times.Software update is major issue.My preused samsung headphone is not compatible with its Jack.Loose .So doesn't works it ought  to be.My Nokia is much better than this phone is every aspect.Not a single time Hang or stuck during any usage.Samsung's  main problem is its processor which is required to be reengineered.In 30 july2020 got an update which was done  vastly. It feels good when the phone is updated regularly since it removes glitches and boosts performance.Samsung is listening its consumers I guess so it is providing updates.What I see in this update is battery is draining  a little faster than before.I am satisfied.Samsung should provide earphone, backcover and screen guard with every models I reiterate.Regards,My review is being altered.for some days  this phone has gone unexpectedly unresponsive. Touch is hectic and the display panel is heated .Samsung has provided me used phone by Amazon. I swear I will never buy  and persuade anyone to buy Samsung mobile ever.

  So I hv used it now for two days and here are my reviews:phone is big enough at this range. Performance is great. There is a dark mode avalable for all android system which I really liked. I am more into camera and I will rate this camera 4. There is too much exposure for photos. But night mode is too good. THis is perfect for low light imaging. But it will overexpose, so u will have to reduce the brightness. Also normal video will zoom a bit which I dont like. But u can shoot it in wide view as well which gives it a different feeling. The pro mode of camera for photos is less adjustable but it can overcome these limitations very well.The battery certainly lasted about 1.5 day on average usage with games, photos videos etc. At this price I think this is a v good deal.

"
"

  Yes.Cost efficiency is what i would call the super trait of M21 to be.This is the worthiest set to be bought at around ₹ 15k. Best Battery capacity and display (super AMOLED!) at this rate. Decent chipset.Been using it for a month. And it, indeed, is very good in overall performance and is more cost effective than I thought. In fact more cost effective than all the Mid Range phones I've bought so far.A massive 6000mAh Battery will sustain the phone for minimum a day but to be honest it does not deserve the hype it got. Also inclusion of a faster charger would have made me happier. But im still happy man!It Does heat up a little bit while charging. But seriously manages to keep the cool even while heavy RAM usage.The design is not appealing coming with a plastic body. This is a small negative which is overshadowed by the remaining overwhelming positives of M21.The april 2020 update is good. Trust me.If ever there is an offer where there is a rate drop below 14000 for a 4-64 variant then go for it.

"
"

  My own experience of 3 days:-Battery- not working good as expected 6000 mah,it's looks like 3500mah.Camera-this is pretty good ,image quality is good.Fingerprints-some times fails to read ir fingerprints otherwise it's good .Network- I'm facing network issues with this phone ,internet connection some time collapse,and also my relatives complaint that he can't able to call me,but I can call him(it's happening since 3 days when I insert my Vodafone 4g sim in my new phone....Otherwise performance is good.

"

  All Parameters are excellent other than below mentioned Points I observed.-Battery Backup- with a normal Usage it will go from 100 to 35% (From 5am till 8pm), less than expected. Actually Some Background Apps consumes so much battery which can't be Disabled.-Camera is OK OK (Doesnt appear to be  48MP quality, there is no in depth clarity in pixels with artificial light), daylight quality is good.(Very very Slight Heating is always there), you can feel it in pocket.-You can't disable notifications related to auto update of apps.-Face Unlock doesnt works sometimes in little dim light,in Light it is good.-No option to display data speed over status bar.-Settings menu is little bit not user friendly. Little bit confusing.- My Backup from Google Drive could not be restored, as it was showing try again later, Tried two times but didn't work, you can only avail this option during setting it first time.Whats app Backup Restored.-Data speed was not good as it was in my last phone(just an Observation)

  I was searching for a phone under 14,000 which would be great for multitasking, daily use & regular gaming and the biggest thing was a great battery. I found many cheap phones from chinese brands making with about 1,000 rupees of difference. But they were unreliable and not as rough and tough as SAMSUNG is. The phones made by SAMSUNG are the most rough and tough phones you can find. And M21 would be a great pick for you. I am using this phone since 2 months and I don't have a single complain, not even a single complain. The phone is great for battery because the 6000mAh battery lasted all day long. I did multitasking and little bit gaming and used my phone the whole day. I just kept it in charge at night for half hour and then it worked for me all day long. The processor and RAM is also too good because I don't see any framedrops, not even a single framedrop in gaming. It is a very smooth experience and the next thing is that it never lagged when I was operating it, never ever. The camera is also a nice pick, the 48 mp camera gives you an awesome shot with the 8mp and 5mp secondary cameras. I also liked the selfie camera because it's of 20 mp and is enough for taking breathtaking selfies. The samsung UI is also a nice pick with a good look and updates also come regularly. The display is just awesome, it is just breathtaking. The Amoled display with the notch gives you a big hit. LAST THING, THIS IS THE BEST PHONE IN THE GIVEN PRICE RANGE, YOU CAN SURELY GO FOR IT.

  I have been using this phone since 2 weeks.Pros1. Manufactured in India2. Display is really good. I can surely distinguish this from my old phone3. Battery life last more than a day even after high usage4. Dolby atmos sound enhances video and audio experience5. Camera is fantastic. Does a good job for a noob photographer like meCons1. Charging wire could have been little longer2. I miss led notification lightOver all Samsung has done a very good job in mid range segment. At this price I did not wanted to purchase some other brand with UI that is more like a adware

  Bought in Amazon india. As mentioned,product was made in India.Which I liked.Comes with ejector pin, travel adapter and usb, and manual with warranty.It supports fast charging. It was mentioned that The USB cable was made in austria. adapter made in India.Takes quite long process while initial start. Make sure that you select what you need.Pros1.Country of Origin-For buyers who look for Made in India phones,definitely you could get this.2.Battery suits for very normal users.3.security Mcafee comes with this. we need to turn on for security.4.Processor is ok.5.Super AMOLED display6.No heating issues.7.Android 10 with UICons1.Mono speaker.2.Camera light output is low. Camera wasn't appreciating. For this price camera design should have been better.3.Lot of preinstalled apps,which I don't like.4.Takes quite long time to charge. Even fast charging mode switched. This was unexpected.5.No headphones or screen guard provided. We need to buy separately.6.Dolby gets switched only when you use headset,bluetooth headset mode.ConclusionGood phone for normal users. I think it won't suit for heavy smartphone users.

  Just after 2 weeks of purchase, this Samsung M21 smartphone suddenly got hung and a portion of the screen is not responsiive. Immediately I  raised a complaint. The technical guy of customer care not even bothered to listen to the complaint. He just told that the return policy expired two days back, just two days and I dont even know about it. How can one expect that this kind of cheap goods being delivered to us. They can stop working at any time if they are too cheap. Amazon thinks the customers are like fools living in amazon forest. They should consider the complaint and need to respond in a constructive way. IN this pandemic matter of two days should be considered and extended.Apart from all these, the service is so bad and irresponsible. They are saying go to the samsung service centre. If we can go there why should one buy from your site? Because we believe better service from you irrespective of who the seller is. If its an offline purchase we should have checked every thing there itself physically. Since its Amazon we blindly ordered just by seeing images but later realized that it is also like ultra low grade e-marketing company after talking to this customer service guy. I just dont want to take his name. When I say how can we go out in this circumstances as ours is containment zone. He simply told not to order from amazon as they also cant deliver here. Amazon should seriously look into this guys behaviour. He is going to make you loose many customers.Finally, I suggest not to buy electronic products, particularly samsung brand from Amazon. Please go and buy offline. They are also suggesting the same indirectly.

  Good product by SamsungBut I think samsung is also going the way of other cheap China mobiles by selling our data. Maybe to tackle the competition?First time when I switched on and starting updates I found other party apps like like videos ,Facebook and other unnecessary  apps started to get installed without my permission.But later these things have to be removed  settings tweaked to tackle the problem and it was really tough.Wasn't expecting this from samsung.(may be they thought that this is low end phone so why to worry?)Camera is good for its priceFingerprint reader and face recognition lock are useless in this price tag as you know if u mind or security as a basic

  Purchased Galaxy M21 for sister as it is non-Chinese. But now I am regretting not buying other brand. Such pathetic M series was not expected from Samsung.Only gud thing abt this phone is Amoled display, large battery and decent camera.Rest everything is impractical...be it1. Plastic back- plastic back is finger print magnate and will get scratches easily.2.Rear fingerprint placement- fingerprint position is so upward that literally u need to find it . Also it is so flat with back body making diffictly in distinguishing fingerprint sensor with back body.3. Slow Processor- processor is slow/laggy. Phone started getting slow from 1st day of usage. Slow opening of app or buffering type slow response which irritates a lot.4. Heating issue- Most pathetic thing abt this phone is its heating issue. Means it will heat more at earpiece area only(upper part of phone). I have used other phones also...but samsung makes record among all in term of heating issue.5. No screen protector and phone cover- Many brands which are much cheaper than Samsung and gives equal quality at low price, include screen protector and phone cover but I don't know why Samsung is doing this. Now I will have to buy it separately.Overall I am disappointed with Samsung mid range phones as they are not made for practical purpose. It will not be wrong to say why brands like Mi, realmse got big boom over Samsung. They provide every practical need which we want.Sorry samsung but this will be my last purchase of samsung phone.

  After around 2 months of using Samsung M21(6GB/128GB) phone it developed display problem..Also some network signal strength issues is seen after switching to this phone...I had to spend Rs 5484/- for changing display as they were telling display is not covered under warranty, many people are facing this issue. Better don't buy this phone.Fingerprint scanner is good Camera is average only.Battery will run for almost 1.5 days with single charging.

  First I bought this phone as my old phone bricked and I needed one urgently. Only criteria was a not a made in china decently modern phone. This one a21 and 31 were trending in market though my research 6 months back wanted me to buy an a50 something these two had the same features CPU etc and processor but lesser ram and storage and one camera less and some megapixels lesser but who needs them anyway. All I need is one decent camera on each side.The camera in this is decent and has multiple modes and options like AR AI and wide angle and so on. Its confusing and I felt not in control. So sticking to 16:9 standard pics. Still the depth is pixelated even at 48 MP.The amoled screen is amazing in vivid colors though it can be quite hard on the eyes. I am keeping it in dark mode mostly and there is also a blue filter. There are also calm modes which put the phone in black and white and do not disturb mode for me time  away from phone.The phone is quite bulky by today's standards about a centimeter with a cover. It doesn't have 5g support either which many new phones bring.This is a mostly made in india phone with exception of charger cable from Vietnam and I am sure the processor and circuits made in Taiwan or china. Nevertheless it was refreshing to see a made in india phone designed by Samsung in a world where anything we buy is made in china. Though I must say the finish of the product and packing is not of such high quality as chineese brands like xiaomi vivo not even compare to one+. But the product itself is of higher quality than chineese phones.The cost is much higher than normal times perhaps due to pandemic or import curbs from china. Atleast 4k more. Such phones are in the 10k range but still feature to feature similar prized mi or others have more cameras and glass body and many more features. Brought this only cos of Made in India.but it has to become  competitive in terms of quality and price to be successful.Update: After a weeks use updating to 5 star. 3 day battery though no real fast charging takes 3 hrs to charge full. Performance is top notch no lag or hang and smooth even with extra animations enabled. Overall happy with the phone.

  I had been always buying budget phones from Chinese brands for my Parents until now. Then I heard about the new Samsung M Series range of phones making sensation in the market with Super AMOLED screen and good configurations for the price. Decided to give it a try this time and ordered the M21 for my dad. Upon receiving the phone, I was blown away by the almost everything this phone was offering in this price range. The screen quality is amazing with definite 2 days battery life. The performance of the phone is more than adequate and easily compares to any other sub 15k phones, but the camera quality, battery and the screen quality surpasses almost all others in this segment. The screen quality is better than even my twice expensive phone which is having IPS TFT panel.Pros:Great screenCamera qualityBattery backupPerformanceSoftware refinementCons:Weight. But its justifying given the massive battery size.Plastic Body. But to be frank, we use phones with cases. So in that case, plastic body is safer than glass. So not a con actually.No bundled earphones. That too can't be really complained in this price range and also currently, no one is supplying the same.Verdict:I am loving it more and my dad is also happy since its a Korean and non Chinese brand and Proudly Made in India phone. This purchase made me order an M31 for my mother the next day, since she is really keen on phone camera quality than my dad, and since this 13k phone amazing for its camera, was having even high hopes for an 18k phone which is having higher camera specs.

"

  Battery life is the main USP of this M series, camera quality is not upto expected but at this price range seeing the other specs the little camera quality can be compromised and if you can really want a good camera then go for M31 or M31s . samsung gives the best amoled display it's a no brainer. Fingerprint is very fast , face unlock is good but not at best but fingerprint unlock works really fast, phone runs smooth as well I'm not a gammer so don't know about that , there is little heating issue only while charging the phone , otherwise I haven't noticed heating issue, the phone comes with minimal blootware that's the best , it is not like any Chinese brands like MI , oppo , realme where you notice adds , so in this samsung one UI there is a near to a stock android experience without blootware and adds and that's very good as well

  I loved this phoneThis has pure samsung flaship level touchresponse.Amoled display is amazing.Battery is amazing.And apart from all theseLook very expensive one in black color .Camera is good .Not heating .Network reception is amazing .Call quality is good .Speaker is good.Its like you hold jewel in your hand .This fone doesnt looks like cheap smartphones like redmi xaomi and real me .Build quality is amazing .If you are not a gamer then go for it under 20k .This is best smartphones and cheapest from samsung.I have recently used realme xt but that one also not feels expensive in your hand .In every aspect this fone is far above the chineese fones.And UI is amazing like you will never get that feeling from any other chinees brand .Amazing fone go for itThink twice before going to choose chineese brand if u r not a gamer .I loved it .

  Do you want an android phone?Do you've a higher perceived brand value for Samsung?Is your budget under INR 13K?If your answer for all of these is YES, then do not wait, just buy it !*** The Processor Debate ***This Snapdragon Vs. Exonys Vs. Mediatek etc, this is all just topics of debate for youtubers. They need content for their channels, don't put your mind in tizzy unless you are a heavy gamer and your life depends on nano-seconds of lag.Yes all these processor debate end at the difference of nano seconds which in real life is even way beyond blink and miss. You can't notice it even if you are Rajnikant. So chose a phone which is VFM for you.*** Perceived Brand Value of Samsung ***Lets just put it out here, Samsung is the Apple of Android world. Right or wrong ? 100% Right !!For me, i always recommended Xiaomi phones to folks who want innovation on a budget. But if you want and Apple but one running Android then Samsung is best bet for you.*** Durability ***Samsung phones are durable and so are even MI phones. I have one Mi A1 still working in mint condition used by my mother. So your decision making should be based on the brand value doe you.*** Battery ***One thing Samsung has learnt for its entry level and mid level offerings is to rightly capture the need. People need large capacity batteries because mobile phone has become one of our limbs, extension of our body part.Added benifit : decent camera , 3.5 mm jack.*** To Summarize ***If you do not want a Xiaomi or Real Me or Moto because you want a SAMSUNG, then go for it, because**** it has massive juice to last**** oh you've a SAMSUNG*** take those 🤳 selfiesTo suarize

  After several research and watching many you tube videos related to drop test and other stuffs bought this mobile but I regret for buying this mobile, just dropped the mobile by 2 feet height, the so called gorilla  glass broke into pieces. Very worst manufacturing just the brand name is getting marketed and sold but product is of cheap quality. Pls also see the pics of broken glass before you decide to buy. My old redmi note 4 is far better in terms of build quality.

  I have been using a smaller 5"" form factor phone for almost 3-4 years. Had been wanting to buy my next phone for quite some time and finally bought this one.And I would say I'm content with the it.It has a vibrant display best in class I would say. I don't notice the U notch for sometime of usage.Good speaker not something loud but good enough.Good cameras for the price! Some might find the selfie camera less impressive but its good enough for social media needs.Excellent battery! Better than all those 1000$ phones! 😁And the performance is fine enough for me, I get some lags here an there but nothing which makes trouble in my daily tasks. I would say the performance is same as compared to my old phone S6 Edge, which is good as it still runs smoothly! 😁 Btw, I don't game much!!Perfect to gift it to your mom, dad or anyone in your family. It has good big fonts. And no bogus softwares you might see in other brands!I would say I made a right decision to not invest in a premium phone and saved a lot of money. This phone gets everything done I need and I believe most users will find it good enough too!

  One of the best in market* sAMOLED 6.4 is delivering high satisfaction  Display is big, good, sharp, crisp and clear  enough, Bright colours.  one of the top reason  to go for M21*Dolby atmos gives amplified audio output* Battery is like ocean* Camera is Crystal Crisp* Fast enough* Best in budget* Video experience is just wowBut also know itBody is plastic but glossy , looks goodThe frame finishing does not give a luxurious feel. But a good cover can do that, anyways you will use a cover to protect it. So this reason should no stop you from getting M21.But when you use It, overall performance is going to be satisfying. 200 % recommend this mobile

  Overall the phone is excellent at this price point.  You cannot go wrong with it.The pros1) Superb 6.3"" display with SuperAMOLED : This is really great to have. There are many higher end phones which are pricier, but every time you view on your phone the display is something that goes beyond its segment2) Awesome battery: I believe this is something very important far more than only performance.  Can be a life saver during the occasional instance when you have forgotten to charge it.  Till now  with most never dropped below 30% charge.  Have a reserve charge is good.Also:  The 15W fast charger is fast enough unlike what people believe.  Just don't wait to charge it until its fully discharged.3) One UI on Android 10 and processor performance: Samsuns's OneUI is decent and consistent now across devices. It looks modern and works without lags. Ofcourse its not a gamer or performance phone. But the Exynos 9611 processor is good enough for most tasks for most people.  Also I am sure Samsung will update to Android 11 and maybe even 12.4) Sales and Service: Not much direct experience, but I see that the service center availability is so much better than my previous phone (ASUS Zenfone)5) Signal Reception and SAR: Having a low SAR value is important . WIFi and call reception is excellent. Speaker is loud and clear.Cons:If I have to pick one con for this phone, its the camera. Its average - if I compare it to the ASUS Zenfone 3, a older phone - but then ASUS specializes in the camera area.So camera is average just like most phones at this price point .

  Performance of the phone is good so far. The finger print scanner is is indeed very fast but the best thing I like about this phone is its super amoled display; it is a treat to watch videos on this phone. Camera I personally don't use much, but the quality of front and rear cameras is pretty good especially the night mode which is very helpful in taking pics in low light.Looks good in hand and it is very lightweight which is an added advantage. Now the storage of 128 GB of which 100 gb is at your disposal which practically eliminates the need for external storage for an average user like me. Sound quality is also good and you can listen to your favourite music anytime.The only drawback is battery which as mentioned 6000mAh doesn't seems to be working as long as it should. It still manages to get 36 hours of usage after full charge which takes almost 2 hours with the fast charging feature.Overall considering the price range it is a very good phone with all the necessary features packed in a compact and lightweight device for the average user.

  Never give a chance to regret.. Go ahead...👍The Icons looks was not so great .. And then I set'Spherlue Icons' from theam and now its looks better with dark mode ...Even though its 6000 Mah I always leaves phone on charging before go to bed ( I like to see my phone 100% every morning 🙂 ).. So I turned off fast charging option..You can do that.. Its will not affect batteryMONSTER :1. Battery :- 4/5Two day battery standby for normal easy2.Display:- 4.99/5Super amaload with full hd.. Superb Display3.Design:4.5/5It has a6000Mah battery, still looking not bulky. Noglass body, but who cares after you put a back cover.. In my opinion, don't spend more money for glass body if you uses back covers4. Camera: 4/5Back camera pretty good but front camera's low light output is very low.. many features available such as slow and super slow videos available..5. OS&UI:- 5/5Android 10 with One UI6.Finger print reader and face lock 4/5Face lock and finger print reader are not so fast7.Processor and performance 3.5/5Exynos 9611 is not meant for PUBG gamers .. But for me its perfect as I am not a heavy gamer.. No lag ang hang till now.. but processor is outdated..8. Charging :3.5/5. No fast charging.. Provided with a 15W charger and iy takes about 3 Hrs to fully reacharge the phone9. Accessories : 2/5No earphone, No Back cover, No Screenguard.. So order backcover and tempered glass when you placing order as its backbody is plastic amd more prone to scratches..10.Loud speaker 3/5Loudspeaker sound level is very low.. (Keep earphones)Verdict: For this price Its the best choice if you are not a hardcore gamerGaming experience is not that much good butYou can play smoothly.It heats after playing 4 to 5 hours.

  Nowadays Samsung comes up with new phones with different series to reach out to all kind of users.After comparing with different,lastly I go with this particular model as it comes with a full package without a burden to your pocket.😁The camera are really good for portraits and wide angles with a giant battery with very decent UI.Even my 1st phone was samsung S2, after that I loved this brand.Am not a gamer, but this fone is really smooth while handling...

  Its a shame that a phone with such great hardware does not have a competing software to complement it. Its one ui2 is inferior to MIUI found on MI/xiaomi phones IMO. If you're used to MIUI like me then some may be disapointed on software front:-pros:-battery life,camera,fast charger,excellent displaycons:-# no usb 3.1 gen2# no bluetooth 5.1 only(5.0)# no wifi 6 supportsoftware(UI) issues# missing call record option during the call.# missing native app lock feature. This is a big one as third party apps are very poor and MIUI version is great. Samsungs 'S Secure' is a breather but not as good as MI's app lock. you have to unlock each app individually in s secure and install it separately.# if you hide text message content on lock screen it gets hidden when you're logged in as well.# No messages feature which can't detect OTP's in messages.# poor file manager compared to MI and google# no support for showing network speed in status bar# no ability to set daily data limits only monthly limits can be set.# very basic messages app compared to MIUI version# more bloatware and app control than MIUI, can'e even uninstall facebook(only disable).# can't limit the number of connected devices via hotspot.# even taking screenshots is more intuitive and fast in MIUI where you just swipe three fingers down the screen or use the button in notification panel. Samsung uses yet another app for screenshots to which you have to grant permission to save the screenshot although you do not have to install it separately.Most of software limitations can be overcome by installing third party or samsung's own apps. But they will slow the phone down as native(OS) implementations are much faster. Also most of these are small usability tweaks which should not take too much efforts to implement but they will improve the user perception of their phones because many people will install apps for these features and slow their phones down and then blame samsung for building slow phones. Hope samsung is listening to this for their own sake.

  Overall good product from Samsung at cheapest price.For me Samsung is most trusted brand from 2004 untill now.Most impressive part of this phone is it's huge two-three days battery backup.And most attractive S-Amoled display.Great sound quality (better than my old galaxy on8)Clean UI6 GB OF RAM128 GB OF ROMBlue colour looks awesome.And a faster processing unit for gaming and multitasking.At last not the least ""Made in India""Love u Samsung India

  SAMSUNG GALAXY M21(4/64).Design - Subjective(I liked it).Build - Sturdy (but using back case and tempered glass suggested)Battery - 6000Mah around 2 days of battery life and charge time is around 2hrs 30mins if 10% battery left.Camera - Shots are well captured and image processing is good. End result is appreciable.Screen Quality - It's Samsung, need not worry about display. Good colour reproduction in SAMOLED. Nice touch response.Processor - Exynos 9611, this is pretty capable of handling almost every task u throw at it. But don't expect heavy gaming like Snapdragon 800 series. Exynos 9611 is similar to Snapdragon 730.OS - Snappy and didn't face any lags.Network reception - Didn't face any issue with BSNL, Wifi..etc.Audio output - Loud enough in the budget range(around 17k).I would suggest this phone if ur requirement is basic to medium likeWhatsApp, instagram, Facebook, YouTube, entertainment, medium gaming.

  Call quality: The phone serves best as a phone. Excellent sound quality and call quality and handoff over VOWIFI and VOLTE. The person can hear my voice clear as well.Didplay: Feels premium while holding the phone, however not so while looking at it from the back side.Networking: The only catch is the network speed. While other phones connect with 150mbps link speed to my  wifi router this phone connects to 2.4Ghz band at max 72mbps and 5Ghz band at around 400mbps. While tested on 2.4Ghz band, the network speed drops compared to my Huawei devices. On 60mbps connection I am getting 30mbps max while on the Huawei device I am getting 56mbps max. Although call quality is good, network signal strength drops to -80dBm compared to Huawei Honor 6x device @ -60dbm. 4G speed on LTE is also below the Huawei device. Getting 4mbps downlink on this device compared to 15mbps downlink on the huawei device. Wifi signal also drops very often and refuses to connect to the router. Then I have to turn the wifi off and on to be able to connect back. This makes this phone unusable.

  Pros:1. I got this mobile against exchange which was good deal2. I also got approx 1200/ addnl deal wrt bank3. Excellent budgeted smart phone In this price range4. 6.4-inch/Super Amoled/FHD / Resolution (2340 x 1080) and 16M color support5. Triple Camera - 48MP Main Camera +8MP Ultra Wide Camera +5MP and 20MP front camera6. Android with  10.0 operating sys 1.7GHz Octa-Core processor, 6GB RAM, 128GB internal memory expandable up to 512GB and dual SIM- 4GCons:1. It’s not 5G handset2. Battery Charger is ordinary ( no quick charger) neither wattage is mentioned on charger- disappointing3. Ear phone is not a part of box which is disappointing.4. Face ID not avlble5. Samsung should limit number of apps that comes with handsets. This unnecessarily lowers down the speed as well storage.

  The youtube itself doesn't have 720p,1080p,4k resolution option, also camera quality is very poor. My old phone which had 12 MP pics were betterthe display was better for my old samsung phone itself ,Very bad. Display is not Good, quality is not good even pictures aren't good. Worst experience. Very disappointed with the product. A lot of people have put this phone in olx I thought there was some mistake but the product is not at all good don't go for it and waste it time.Overall Display  and Camera is not upto the mark as mentioned in features.

  It's good phone in this range. I am overall satisfied with performance, mentioning some pros and cons for other buyers.Pros- Awesome Camera- Non-Chinese- Samsung Brand- Pre-Installed AppsCons- Battery is not what they claim, my last phone was Asus Maxphone with 5000 mah. Here they claim 6000 mah but it is not giving same backup as 5000 Mah battery phone was giving when it was new.- Touch is not that smooth- Casting (Playing on  my Smart TV) is difficult, you cannot do casting when your hotspot is on.- Speed of data is also slow, same sim giving better signal and data speed in other phone as compared in M-21.

"
"

  After using all most 2wks. Here is my honest opinion.1. Battery does not look at all 6000MH2. If you use mobile for continous 2hr it will heat like anything.3. Touch screen is real slow.4. Though camera quality is ok type but not so impressive in this price segment.5. Taking screen shot is real headache...Overall..Dnt buy it guys.. Dnt know about A series.. but M series is not at all upto mark.

  I had purchased Samsung Galaxy M21 6GB RAM 128 GB on 3rd July. Model is good, sAmoled display good. Battery performance best. Fast Charging good. But the processor not good for gaming. I have installed Asphalt 8 car game, mobile is lagging sometime evenI have 6GB RAM model. You can use mobile for all things except Gaming. I hope Samsung will think on it and changed their mobile processor.

OS&UI: 5/5 Android 10 with One UI.6.Finger print reader and face lock 5/5 Face lock and finger print reader are not so fast7.Processor and performance 4/5 Exynos 9611 is not meant for PUBG gamers, but for me its perfect as I am not a heavy gamer..

  Been using this device over 2 week now. I have got 4 GB/64GB varient. 0Display  10/10 super amoled display. Samsung  never disappoints when it comes to displayDesign 9/10  The design is quite handy and convenient . Easy to hold and use. It's quite light in weightPerformance  9/10 its comes with 4 GB ram and octane core processor.  You could easy switch between app and face no issues . The phone rarely lags .Battery  10/10 it comes with a 6000mah  battery life. You get your phone full charged  in morning and would not have to fuss about charge throughout the day .Charging  9/10 the inbox charger is a bit slower you could switch to a more powerful one .Camera 9/10 it has a triple camera of 48 +8+5 and a front camera of 20 . Bright light photography is excellent.  Video  stabilization is also good . Low light  photography is also quite satisfactory.Interface 10/10 Samsung user interface is always one of the best and simplest.  The phone is quite convenient to use . It comes with android 10.Price 9/10 quite value for money .Overall 9/10 excellent performance for a phone this budget.  Specially if you are looking for a non Chinese phone.

  1. This product has alot of network issues, especially when one uses JIO, as it won't catch the network and internet browsing becomes quite irritating.2. Sometimes i faced alot of slow charging issues also, for eg. In total 20 minutes, it charged overall 0-2%.But sometimes this phone runs smoothly which showing any kind of above mentioned issues. Maybe these could be fixed in upcoming software updates.

  I am ok with looks ,battery SAmoled,UI cus i am using samsung from long ling time, only one time i used Huwaei .I was using A series before this . I wanted a second phone so bought this but disappointed with adaptive brightness. Its hell ...i mean i felt cheated and sad also feel cheap inside my mind that why i bought this phone, as adaptive Brightness is an important factor for me . Adaptive brightness is not happening at all and also very very slow.sometimes not working at all.i never wanted a fully chinese phone , So i bought this one.but a big thumps down, also heard M30s and M30 also have same issues.Samsung its cheap play

  Honestly, my thoughts were divided when I was purchasing this handset. There are so many reviews, so many mobiles and so many features in this price range. And, there are so many different scales to measure performance that it felt like propaganda to promote cheap mobiles.With a leap of faith, I booked this phone. When I opened the box and switched it on, I immediately started feeling better. As I explored it further, I realized that all those marketing gigs are nothing but propaganda.What I purchased is a perfectly blended masterpiece of quality, performance and price.Amazing picture quality with rich color and perfectly balanced contrast; smooth touchscreen without any lags even when all my regular apps are loaded in RAM.Finally I would say, it has completely satisfied my needs. Now, I enjoy playing games in my gaming console but if someone prefers mobile for the same then please read other people's comments for further research.

  Mobile is good..but not extraordinary...even though having 6000mah, battery drains fast.Camera is good. Mobile Charging at par with other normal mobiles.

  It's practically the same phone as M31 from inside , only difference being camera quality and back plastic finish.I don't care about the back plastic finish as i always put covers on my phones - which you should do too. This is a damn good phone, don't overthink it just get it.When i was buying this phone i was really confused which one to get -M31, Redmi note 9 pro, etc.  But i took the leap and got this one - and i'm really happy. Don't be too critical if you want a robust phone that gets the job done.I was blown away by the AMOLED screen and whenever i see some images on it i still can't believe how good the screen is. At night the blacks are ABSOLUTELY black - an image with black background will look like it's floating if you're in a pitch dark room - point being the contrast is amazing.Camera is great, could be better - but that could be said for literally every phone. On this budget itna hi milega.Battery life is GREAT. I use it mildly for whatsapp, instagram, casual games, google apps, camera etc. and i honestly forget to charge my phone in 2 days, and i charge it on 3rd day morning.I recommend getting 6gb ram 128gb storage version.Just get it - don't think too much, don't waste time comparing, just get it.Highly recommend.

  Pros :1. Battery - absolutely monster of a battery. Never ran out of battery in a day even with heavy use. U can just keep ur power bank at your home forever with this.2. Display - Best display in this range. Nothing to argue about that. Media consumption experience becomes top quality because of this. Whether it's YT or Amazon Video or Netflix u can watch it in highest quality.3. Camera - Decent camera. Absolutely ok for normal regular selfies and videos.4. User interface - Awesome experience with the latest UI. Very light, almost like stock android. No unwanted ads or bloatwares. Fantastic.5. Android security updates - U get updates very fast. Probably after google and nokia phones Samsung is the third best in this area.Cons -1.Back made of plastic - Gives it a cheap feel.2. Ok Processor - The processor is not super powerful. It does all regular work and multitasking very smoothly. Also light gaming is ok. But for heavy gamers it's not gonna suffice.

  There were  some  teething  problems  like ""freezing"" within a few days  of receiving  the phone.Upon contacting you, I received a routine reply for my first call of complaint.My special  thanks to your  Service  Executive Neetu who arranged  the technician's visit  to me on 17th Sep.Thanks to your service technician Shiva, who  guided  me through  telephone  from  Guntur city in Resetting  the phone to ""factory reset "" mode.It had helped resolving  the issue.The phone is  working good for now.So, Shiva  did not have  to come to  my town personally.Thanks  Amazon.

  Pathetic phone. It cannot be called a phone because it does not do what a phone is supposed to do - make calls. It keeps getting disconnected everytime you're on a call. The network reception is also pathetic, it cannot receive signal from a tower far away. Every time it gets automatically disconnected the phone cannot connect to the carrier and you have to wait for half hour to make another call. If it seems too good to be true then it is too good to be true. I bought the phone for my mum thinking it has a good battery but what's the point of having a good battery and not being able to make calls?!EDIT: An update fixed almost all the issues for now. We'll see how long it lasts.

  The device is great at this point.1. Excellent  -  Screen, Camera.2. Average  -  Processor(PES at 60 fps hangs) , Network Connectivity (A little poor at low Connectivity  compared to Redmi and Lenovo devices that I had)3. Bad -  It heats a lot sometimes. Especially  during  Charging,  if you have your hotspot  on, it heats a lot, really a lot. And sometimes, it doesn't,  like its unpredictable.  I think this can be improved  by some software updates pls. This bothers me. Very less heating  while playing  games, but too hot while charging.Update:- The geating problem has resolved significantly  after the last 2 updates . Now  it hardly heats up. Kudos to the Samsung Team.

  Phone is upto the mark according  to  the  price.•Charging is 4/5 little slow but the battery life  is just awesome.•Camera is 4/5 but considering the price  this is  the  best you can get.•Fingerprint  is 4/5 sometimes it doesn't  respond to the finger quickly  but it is  good  as it has quite  fast response.•Display  is just awesome 5/5. With  wideline L1 certification  you can actually  watch  4k videos. If you watch movie/webseries frequently this phone is for you.•This phone is not made for heavy games but it can easily play  less heavy games like subway  surfer etc.Hope this helps :).

  So you wanted to buy a budget Samsung phone and you bought this piece is junk! I wanted to warn you all, this phone will develop problems..I started having touch issues within 3 months. So you go to the service centre and hope they fix it. What you don't know is that the service centre will tell you parts are not available and you will be given full refund in the form of a gift certificate that can ONLY be used in offline Samsung stores! So you'll go and start looking for offline stores only to realise it's only the Samsung smart cafe's that accept the gift certificate. You'll also realise that none of the m-series will be sold offline! Then you are forced to shell out 2k or 3k more to but an A series. This whole thing is a huge scam. Avoid this model and Samsung. They are cheating people

  Phone has heating issues, battery charge takes 2hrs:45mins to get full charge Camera not upto the mark though we have many camera features. Slim and good design, colour is good but cheap quality plastic back mayerial. I didnt like.  Processor compamy promises a powerful chipset. But while playing games, its quality is poor. Lags in Between. Its worst. I'd suggest you to go for realme 5pro in this price range. Overall out of 5 I'd rate 2.2 - 2.5

  Pros:1.Fast.2.Good software.3.Nice Camera-sharp daylight pictures-almost real colors.4.Good Display-sharp letters.Volume is just sufficient5.Battery charging and discharging are fine-good battery life.6.Calling through wi-fi is attractive.and many.Cons:1.Both battery and battery charge get  heated while charging even when fast charge is in off.2.Volume may be enhanced a little.3.Ear phone exclusively designed for this phone may be supplied.4.Sim tray pin quality is not upto the mark5.Design may be changed for easy opening and closing of the box.Overall worth for money.

  If you are planning  to buy Samsung  mobile please  make sure that you are going to suffer by its very poor internet connectivityOverall mobile is impressive  but if you can't connect  with internet  then why you spend in smartphoneInstead of this i would like to definitely  recommend  that you have to go for any other made in india brand i made mistake  and i m suffering  now i have mi and realme with same jio sim and it plays 480p video anytime in home but in samsung m21 you cant even send WhatsApp  msgs its shows sqaure box whit your msgCamera  is goodLow light performance  is poorCamera  could perform  better if there was good optimizationBattery is superb i have used 9hrs and battery  was 10% charging  time is 3hrs or 2hr 50 minScreen is superbFingerprints  sensor  is good and fast 9 out of 10 times it opensTaking Screenshot  is bit problem  palm gesture  isnt working and physical  buttons  are headache you have to use assistant  ballPlastic quality  is something  that you'll  complain  it is below  average  even realme c2 worth 5000 mobile is better than thisOne ui is goodOne last thing you have to really think twice before  buy because  of very poor connectivity  of internet I'm  repeating  and low accuracy of GPS so i think this would help you

  Package was well packed. It doesn't xome with protective film/tempered glass and back case so add +300rs.Phone is lightweight considering its dimensions and 6000mah battery.Finger print is quite fast, camera is very good better than note9pro, note8 pro but i can hardly say that camera is better than note7 pro( which has great sensor + gcam compatablity).Charging is the weak link of m21/m31. Its gets fully charged around 2hour 30mins. Battery life is quite good. You can put it in darkmode to get extra battery life(thanks to a beautiful amoled).Many would argue it is not fast. But 90% dont care about if its loads 2-4 apps 1 sec later than note9pro. OneUI is quite efficient, and taking about UI its way cleaner than RealmeOS, funtouchOS its one the level of OxygenOS (if not better). You'll not see pathetic, adult adds like from shareIT, UC, Mi browsers or realme browser.(Of course you can turn it off but many are just pathetic).And taking about chinese, samsung has closed or shifted many of its manufacturing units from china. And its biggest manufacturing unit is India, and samsung has started manufacturing its flagship smartphone here in Noida. Thus we can say that it's the best brand who is least relies on china.On that Note, ""software in a week , hardware im a year"" - Sonam wangchuk.

  I purchased it in april 2020 in Rs-12699/- But now this same product is Rs- 13999/-. Its very bad impression on SAMSUNG. when every Indian try to NO CHINESE PRODUCT. At the same time SAMSUNG COMPANY cheated middle class people. People will teach you a good lesson in future. Otherwise mobile is good compare to other mobile except Design/LOOK

  After one month of usage i found that in low light front cam is an absolute tragedy.We can see grains while zooming in a pic taken at low light.Night mode in rear cam is also comedy.But in daylight it's a real monster.Dolby feature is only available when headset is plugged in which i didn't feel any difference when turning on/off Dolby Atmos.One thing to mention about this device is its sAMOLED display.It's a real treat to eyes.If you are a series/film addict you should go for it.I can see a whole lot difference between normal lcd display and sAMOLED.No problem with network reception/speed like Qualcomm powered devices.Fast 2 day delivery and packed with powerful battery and processor,fast biometric recognition, i think it is the best budget phone in India now(If you are a photoholic pls avoid this, even i have regrets).Another defect i found is it heats up heavily when we use it under sunlight or use it in closed conditions like car etc.Don't know it's because of sAMOLED display.But sure not it's battery.Thanks seller. 1 star less for bad low light sensor/camera.

  For me bying a budget phone means  never go for cheap Chinese phone, so I always prefer Samsung over other brands. A reliable brand with whom I have long lasting relationship, its like 'Never give a chance to regret'..My realistic opinion1. Battery :- 5/5Two day battery standby for normal easy2.Display:- 4.99/5Super amoled with full Hd.. Superb Display.3.Design:4/5It has a 6000Mah battery, still looking not bulky. I am happy it does not haveglass body and who cares after you put a back cover.. In my opinion, don't spend more money for glass body if you uses back covers.4. Camera: 4.5/5Both camera pretty good... many features available such as slow and super slow videos available..only lacking Lens stabilisation which would have preferred but keeping in mind this phone is budget phone…5. OS & UI:- 5/5Android 10 with One UI 2.06.Finger print reader and face lock: 4.5/5Face lock and finger print reader are satisfctory but finger print scanner fumbles occasionall.7.Processor and performance 4/5Exynos 9611 is not meant for PUBG gamers .. But for me its perfect as I am not a heavy gamer.. No lag and hang till now..8. Charging : 3.5/5.Only adaptive fast charger. Provided with a 15W normal charger only.9. Accessories : 2/5Only Battery charger provided.10.Loud speaker 4/5Loudspeaker sound level is pretty satisfactory for me. One can use ear phones for intricate sounds of music if one wishesVerdict: For this price Its the best choice if you are not a hardcore gamer ...

  Hi... I am from Kerala, aleppy. I am reviewing this #wattamonster samsung galaxy M21 black after one week of my high usage. I am really impressed with the sAmoled screen which couldn't avoid any cost from my 1st level experience. Battery capacity is outstanding and really thankful to samsung for this model. I am financially an average man. So for me it is affordable and am extremely happy with this model. Moreover I am so happy and proud to use a samsung product than any chines product. So finally those who are looking for neat and good camera, body, durable, long-lasting battery and sAmoled screen....just go for it.... No doubt...attaching some of the photographs i took from this phone... I am really happy with this model.

  PRO'S1. Good weight distribution of the phone.2. Amazing screen.3. Best fingerprint reader for this budget, amazingly fast.4. Samsung's one UI is good.CON'S1. 6000 Mah battery stated by samsung but it doesn't feels like. I have previously used 5000 mah phone but this one feels like it has 4000mah approx.If i even used it for normal games like candy crush it does not even last 1 day.2. Worst camera. This is the worst part as many people when buying a mid ranger expects to have a decent camera performance so that they can atleast take good photos for the social media or any other work.BUT the camera performance is so poor that i was disappointed in it.The photos have no clarity when you even zoom in a little bit into the photos.This is very bad coming from Samsung.TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED WITH SAMSUNG.

  I am writing this review after using M21 for a week. And my review is based on truly improved Samsung M series with my best experience1.BUILD QUALITY.Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount.2.DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT.With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Fingerprint on back is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.3 SOUND QUALITY.After using for hours I found the Speaker this time Samsung made is much improved with Bass Stereo which was missing earlier. The in-ear delivers your ear the pure Dolby Atmos with clear precision and crystal clear bass effect.4.CAMERA.This time M series did a great job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 48 mwgapixel with Single Take feature. Samsung gives what it advertises. Which made me to stick to Samsung brand. My usage of Camera is high &  well lit captured shots5.BATTERYMain benefit of this midrange M series is it's maasive 6000mAh battery which gave me enough for nearly 3 days continuously.So I highly recommend everyone who need a budget phone with high specifications need to buy this ..Worth for Money paid..

  Got refurbished m21 phone received

  A very good battery life. Almost 18% decrease after 4hours of continue usage. Charging time almost 2hr 30min. Earphone sound quality is very very good. Use a good earphone with this phone. And it's super amoled display is more than super. You will feel every video. I can't describe it with words.Camera quality is too good. You can not get this type of camera in any 15k phone. I don't know about gaming but the phone is too smooth to operate. Charging cord is not so long but I don't think this is a major problem. Till now I don't feel any kind of heat. Its microfone is moderate but not bad. It's ok. Almost 15gb Rom is used by system. And listen, kindly update your system as soon as you get this phone. Check it.  A system update is already available which is 450mb in size.At last, at 14k it is an amazing phone. You can go for it.Stay safe guys. Good Luck.

  Excellent phone. Hardware configuration and working are really good. Signal reception, camera are good.One issue with software: Kid's (3-4yr) voices are not being captured by few apps - Live Transcribe, Google Meet, WhatsApp video. Irony is WhatsApp voice recorder is able to capture but not the video. Inbuilt voice recorder is also able to capture (hence my claim that hardware is good). Giving 4 star out of 5 for this reason.Had to return the product only because of this issue. Amazon's service was really good: They first accepted replacement, when the replaced piece had same issue, I placed request for return. Amazon kindly considered it and refunded the entire cost. Thank you!

  Great camera and battery life, and One UI really sweetens the whole experience, BUT...If you search for yellow/tint in comments you'll find many users have noticed the amoled display despite its clarity and contrast has a slight defect and has a red/yellow tint when looking directly at the screen (at 0°), which shifts depending on the angle.For me it is reddish on the top halfDarkmode eases the experience, but once u notice it you can't unnotice it and its very hard to get over it. Most users would be blown away by an AMOLED clarity and contrast and might not notice it.It is a common defect found in cheaper Samsung panels.Unless ur OK with unnatural color tint on ur screen, I would recommend AGAINST buying this phoneGoing to send mine for a replacement... I'll update what hapoens

"
"

  It has some  cool features likeFinger print reader for unlock and also notifications panel navigation in home screenHowever felt little heavy may be its due to its Monster battery ;)However the battery life is atmost one day even for its capacity of 6000mah if we use most of the options and featuresFeeling little discomfort for one handed use as the volume buttons are positioned too highThis is my first time using multiple primary camera modelStill trying all the optionsSo far I like Live focus option a lot.Even after taking the picture we can change the blurredness in galaxy as per our likingAs of now camera quality  is good for day time pictures

  Writing my review after 3days of usage.Excellent mobile in this price range.Display quality is awesome.48mp rear camera & 20mp front camera excellently do their job.RAM & ROM is sufficient as I'm a average  mobile user.I dont play games in mobile so not sure about the gaming experience.I was hearing songs and saw 2 movies for a full battery charged.  Battery charging speed is also good, took around 2.5 hrs to full charge. Dint felt the heat as seen in MI.Video & Audio quality is superb. Dolby Atmos plays a fair role in the Audio quality.Touch sensitivity is accurate with the Cornered gorilla glass which gives good safety for display screen.Overall it's a very good quality budget mobile with awesome configuration in this price range.

  A good photos which decent performance in all segments like battery backup, camera, display etc.  i purchased this for my mother and she is quite happy with her phone.Samsung phones generally have a very low SAR value  and thus they are a very good options for you of you are planning for buying for your loved ones.Here are my top reasons to choose Samsung over others chinese products which are offering so much in this price range1) S.Amoled ( because this is the most used features atleast for my mother she have nothing to do with performance etc)2) Low SAR Value ( Samsung provide the lowest SAR value in mobile market)3) No Android Ads ( unlike Realmi/redmi where ads are a major problem and sometimes they are very inappropriate to scroll in public)And thats it, however if you are gamer or camera lovers thans this is not your cup of team better look for other options in this price segment.

  Like - Samsung UI experience was very good, enjoyed using as it is my first Samsung phone. Enjoyed watching movies & youtube. Colours are vibrant.Dislike -Camera - very badIt does not have stabilization. Image processing is pathetic. 48mp (rear) & 21mp (front) is just a gimmick. You just cant have good a picture, as it completely changes the photo texture. (I had Motorola X Play with 21mp as rear camera and used it for 5 years, picture taken were very good. If we zoom it, it would provide with very good details). May be some would be interested in getting picture which are soft texture rather than more of natural image, those can give a shot at this phone.Video - Just forget of taking a good video! No stabilization and keeps blurring.Battery - Not good.Handset which I have got, I have observed that if I use phone with Wifi - it works around 1-2 days based on my use. But, when I use mobile network then I see that phone does not even last a 12 hours with general use such as browsing, streaming (I dont play games so I wont comment on battery life for games).Opinion - If you really want to buy this phone, first you check this phone personally with someone who is already using it and then buy it. I have seen many good reviews about this phone, so above points which I have written is based on my experience with this handset. If you want to buy Samsung, I would say go for A series such as A50s or A51 or A71 depending on your budget. If you dont have budget (like I had constraint) and want to go with Samsung then you will have to live with its cons.Note - There is no return option, you can get replacement but that will be a task for you.

  This phone is only best for battery and nothing else. The camera is not so good as compared to the other phones in this price segment. The audio output from the speaker is very low, even samsung has mentioned that it has Dolby Atmos which enhances the audio output but whenever I put the Dolby Atmos function ""on"", There is no audio enhancement, such a poor audio output quality from both speaker as well as the 3.5 mm earphone jack. Also, the body build quality is very bad and cheap. Samsung mentioned that it has L1 support for the HD video content but whenever watching hd quality video even on the youtube, it degrade video quality form high to low resolution. And at the end, with such bad impression while holding and operating this phone, feel that the price of this is much high. It should be around 8k to 9k only for the quality they are selling. Go for the Nokia phones, they are far better than all these kind of phones.

  I am writing this review after using this phone for more than a month.1) fingerprint sensor is not that good as of oppo / vivo / moto. Sometimes it may takes 2-3 attempts to open the phone with fingerprint sensor.2) camera quality is great of back side. But front camera is not as much good as it says of 20 mega pixel. In proper lights front camera works excellent.3) there's no as such hanging but sometimes it start lagging for a second or few.4) sound quality is decent.5) the back cover of phone is of plastic material so after using it for a month with backcover though, there are few scratches.6) there is inbuilt hidden space in the phone in which you an hide photos or videos . But there is no security lock facility. So you can create a hidden folder but indirectly it's of no use as anybody can just open it by going to gallery settings.7) battery life is excellent.  And yeah takes time in charging but it's 6000mh battery. I'm a non gamer person, so in my case once a battery gets fully charges the phone works for around 1.5 day efficiently.Final remark :- it's is a decent phone from Samsung in this price range. Although if you are okay to buy Chinese phones than there several other phones also which you can find good in this price range.

  After 3 days of using here is my review-1. Battery is Good even though I am heavy user it's holds fine.2. Camera isn't good it simply isn't and if you are thinking about downloading Gcam here is the bad news, Gcam doesn't support exynos.3. I don't know about gaming as I don't play games so you can check it on YouTube.4. Build quality is really good even though it's plastic.5. It's a nitpick but I wish it had gorrila glass 5 instead of 3.6. Screen is beautiful. My sister bought redmi note 8 and let me tell you the difference between them is real, Amoled is really different.So overall it's a phone for people who want a battery life, decent camera(I guess), and good performances with beautiful screen at only 12699.

  Hi,I switched to samsung brand after using MI phones after current against china situation. Overall Product is good.below are my comments.1. Back panel body is of plastic which gives premium look but at the same time shows fingers marks.2. Camera quality is descent.3. Battery is 6000 MAH but need to recharge on daily basis without playing any games, only accessing emails and whatsapp chats4. Front screen touch feels feathersoft.5. Finger print sensor does its job very smoothly6. Problem with data, my other phone shows all 4 network bar (Full coverage) however after inserting same sim in this phone, I never seen it went more than 2 bars. Also phone's data connection gets OFF after receiving voice call even after I kept ""Use mobile data during calls"" option ""ON"" (major problem). I asked samsung customer care, but still problem is the same..Samsung needs to work on this.About replacement:I got phone replaced with in 2 days, But again the same issue with the phone, however using same SIM in REDMI phone it works perfectly for network bar and connectivity. Need refund for the same, Very disappointed with the product.

  I'm using 6GB/128GB Variant of this device from last three days, so my review will be on the basis of 3 days experience with the device and I will update it after I spend more time with the device.0. Design & Build - I prefer a good looking phone but this phone is simple in looks, simple look doesn't mean bad look but it is not very good looking also. Fingerprint is given at the back of phone and phone is built by using plastic material & I got two scratches on the backside so please order a back cover when you order phone as there is no backcover in the box. Display is protected by gorilla glass 3.1. Camera - I'm not a selfie lover but I use camera in daily life for clicking images of receipts, flowers and some random pics of different objects. Sometimes the camera will give you very good results if there is proper lighting but some shots are noisy if I talk about camera quality. Front camera clicks well also. Night shots are not great but considering budget it's okay as every phone struggles to click good pictures in night. If you want to install GCAM then it is not supported very well in this device, there are many mods but functions don't work properly.2. Display - You will get best display in this price range with this device, great for media consumption.3. Performance - I'm not a gaming person but I use a lot of apps in smartphone, I have installed around 30+ apps in my phone but didn't face a lag in opening & switching the apps till date. I don't know about gaming performance of the device.4. Software - It runs on Android Q(10) with heavy customizations from Samsung who calls it One UI 2.0. There are a lot of bloatware apps pre-installed in the device but the good news is you can either uninstall them or disable them. The UI is very intelligently designed and feels very smooth & engaging. It's colorful & feature-rich. You can use dual apps and always on-display is a good feature that I'm using now. Explore the phone settings and you will get to know more of the exciting features present on this phone. But honestly I loved the UI designed by samsung. I'm using a Samsung device for the first time in my life & I'm happy about the software. It's very easy to use.5. Battery - Battery takes approx. 3 hours to fully charge but after a charge you can easily expect a 1-2 day battery life with mixed usage. Battery life is really good on this smartphone.6. Fingerprint reader & face unlock are really very fast & accurate most of the times.So my suggestion is if you need a smartphone with great display, good software, good camera, very good battery life then go for it but If you prefer good build quality with good looks , very high gaming performance or a very great camera device you can check other options. I will update the review If I notice something really good or bad about the device later but for now I'm more than happy with this device.

  Writing this review after using for more than one month. Pros- smart slim looks, awesome display, touch function very smooth, great camera quality, user friendly camera features, processor os etc of latest versions, fingerprint reader working fineCons- Battery is problematic in terms of Charging time & Overheating. After using for one month I find that it takes 3hours or more to be charged full(from 8% to 100% it took 3hrs 10mins) everytime. I dont understand what is the point of giving a Fast charger then! Battery survives one 24-30 hours with moderate to heavy use, which is fine. But the charging time is too much. Also, it gets heated quite often if you have kept your data on, after few mins of turning off data it cools down. It may be possible I unfortunately received one product with problems, but, yes, my dissapointment over this one battery issue outdid its all other good features.

  I have just used it for three days, but I had to tell you it's an amazing phone. It's  a great phone in the mid range though MI has a better variant at lesser price but hey stay away from China. Coming back to the phone the fingerprint sensor is great, display is mindblowing , battery backup great, camera is decent enough for me though when you compare to redmi's variant little below par.

  I must admit that samsung is now selling good quality phones at 15 to 20K range. Previously i booked poco X1 , which I didnt find very good as one of my friend has that. I got this at 15.2K , 3K cheaper than the poco.I think for someone with similar budget can choose this phone over poco, xaomi or honor bcoz it has exynos 9611 that is a good processor , excellent picture quality (although some may say that i doest have 4 camera but i find picture quality of all the phones with 2 or more camera as same),128/6 memory and sAMOLED is the real deal maker.And whats more samsung phones have higher working life - they easily lasts for 18 to 24 months(my previous phone, samsung A50 running perfectly since April 2019 without even a minor issue) and resale value is good as well.Good luck !!!!

  This is the best thing which has been done in MID RANGE mobile phone till date. You won’t believe; where other phones struggle to keep them alive till day end and you have to put charger on. It is left with so much of juice that it needs charging only the next day in the morning after 10 AM. I am an office goer who needs battery backup which lasts more than 24 hours, my M21 outperform there. With easily operative blue light filter mode this does not give any strain on my eyes even when I use continuously for more than 2 hours. It is the safest gadget to be used by my children to save their tender eyes.All Samsung M21 mobiles are manufactured in India only which gives me a pride.In a Nutshell:1. Has 6000 mAH monster battery for one and half daylong performance2. Super Smooth Android 10 with One UI3. Very Powerful exynos 9611 processor4. Dedicated SD Card support.5. sAMOLED Screen with the best display in the segment undoubtedly6. 48 MP Highly Capable primary cameras which is way better ahead of its competitor both for day and night shoots7. 20MP Selfie camera – which acts as wefie

  Camera will not disappoint.Battery average despite large size.Screen quality amazing - excellent.Finger lock is quick.Best thing no chinese brand.

  What makes me Smile.1) Good Battery, single charge will last you the entire day, Medium usage.2) Good screen, very clear and good picture quality.3) Processor is fast and multi tasking is smooth.4) Camera, is good and takes clear and accurate pictures.What makes me Sad.1) Starts getting heated easily, you can observe higher heat levels next to the camera. Hope this does not create a bigger issue.2) The curved grip is slippery, if you don't hold the phone properly, you will drop it.3) The box that it came in looks very suspicious, the stickers can easily peel off or put back. Price and bar code.

  Nice smartphone with great Battery, Camera and fingerprint reader.It's obviously better than Xioami(Redmi) smartphones because it never heats up like Xioami smartphones.It has a great Battery Backup.We Indians mustn't buy smartphones from chinese companies as they are useless and are not reliable as samsung.Believe me it's better than redmi note 8 pro( I am saying this as I have bought both).When I went through the product description of redmi note 8 pro I thought it might be a better smartphone than samsung galaxy m-21 or m30s but I was proved wrong when I bought samsung galaxy m-21.At last I want to say redmi smartphones are better in description section only and samsung smartphones are good in reality.Don't just buy a smartphone by going through the product description section

  **A Big NOO for Gaming!(4GB varient).ASPHALT 9 lags very bad at High setting and even on Low settings the Gameplay is not Smooth. SIMCITY (pretty basic game) is not smooth,frequent Lags.**UI(2.0) is Neat n Clean but NEEDS MORE OPTIMIZATION in M21.There are lot of Frame Drops or  Lags between switching apps,Loading Apps,etc.Sometimes Phone take more time to process things than usual (sometimes only) like unlocking phone.**Rest everything is good like Battery Display.

  Bought this phone for my mother & we are really happy with it. The battery very easily lasts her 2+ days . She mostly uses it for whatsapp, general browsing & YouTube videos. The back camera is really good. It takes about 3 hours to a full charge & a lot of people complain about its slow charging speed but thats fine as a 6000mah battery at 50% is almost equivalent to any 3000mah phone. The built quality is very decent & the OS is smooth as butter. Love this one by samsung as I wanted to avoid redmi phones for their shady advertisements OS. Would recommend this whole heartedly! Well done Samsung !

  Not at all acceptable Camera output from Samsung when they charge higher prices than others.Trust me my Vivo V9 Pro with main camera 13+2mp & front 12mp camera produced far better images than this M21's 48mpI also have Realme5pro - 48mp camera phone - and I just cant imagine to compare its photos with M21's.I seen 100s of videos on YouTube which shows M21 vs M31 camera comparison - and most of they said M21 & M31 produce 95% same results. Thank God I didn't wasted more 2k on M31 if it was to give the same photos.( I decided to buy a NON CHINESE BRAND - so bought M21 - though I know this mobile's 90% parts would hvae been from China 😂)Strictly NO for M21 if you want nice camera results.on the top it takes 2+ hours to charge 100% from 15-20%. (thanks to 15W slow Fast charger in this price)Other good points -Battery is big so obviously it will last long ( and anyway you will not going to use camera much so it will save more battery 😜)LED display and touch is smooth - as you expect from Samsung.UI is clean and simple

  Thank you Samsung, for giving such a wonderful phone in an affordable price.The Super Amoled, brings display to life, the sound quality with good earphones is a watching treat.The camera is superb in day time & well lit areas. Night mode is impressive too. I actually gifted this to my brother, who is an all day gaming freak. He loves this M21, though he used to charge 2 to 3 times his previous mobile in a day. This phone goes for him all the day fully. Thank you Samsung, cheers!!, becoming our favourite brand back again, I feel.

  A very good phone at this budget. You may get some fancy specs at same price from Mi or any other chinese manufacturer but the differentiating factors are screen, battery & camera.  Samsung AMOLED screens are the best in phones. You simply can't get a better screen from any other vendor. You only can compare with another samsung phone.  Battery of 6000 mah last sa min of 2 days even for a heavy user. Camera is very good. Face unlock works very well.  Only cons i experienced was that with all the gear like case and temper glass it looked a bit bulky. But larger screens have become a norm and that's manageable to me.

  Very good superb,  non chineese and branded good camera mind blowing  pictures 48mp main and triple and also more clear samsung camera with 4k videos and super slomo i really like it, more clarity pictures than samsung and amazon  sample pics, sAmoled display very good display nothing to find better than this, 20mp selfie camera good quality,  good sound quality  dolby atmos awesome 6000 mah unbelievable  i think it is better than apple and other chineese xiaomi, vivo, oppo , real me, blindly purchase m21 it is best alrounder surely,  compared to specifications this is very low price i think 30,000 is reasonable price for this specifications  in samsung

  Excellent for watching movies and hearing music. SAMOLED and Dolby atmos are above average. Night photography is poor although daylight photography is satisfactory. Battery life is good but doesnot support quick charge. Max is 1.5amp is what I got. Nor Samsung provided 3amp fast charger. It was 2amp charger out of the box. No hanging or heating issues and all sensors work well.

  My previous device was Asus Zenfone Max Pro M1. By the time I bought this, Realme 7 was launched on flash, which in anyone's first look would be the best favourite in 15k range of smartphones. I never wanted to buy a Chinese made UI phone, the same reason why I bought Max Pro M1 more than 2yrs ago. Not because of this fake nationalism media furore, but because I genuinely care about my privacy. I always appreciate true Android OS experience, with the freedom to control my apps and settings. Why I'm writing about these things? Let's see.1. Samsung Galaxy M21 comes with its One UI 2.0, which has been recently updated to 2.1 with some camera improvements. It offers exactly same freedom to control app's permissions, check individual battery usage, use themes and feels better than the cheaper looking MiUI and RealmeUI.2. It comes with Samsung Max VPN function and I'm quite content with it. It saves me a lot of resources to not invest in a VPN subscription. However, it's slow and makes the browsing experience sluggish - story of every VPN ever existed. Still it's okay from privacy p.o.v.Now coming to the device's performance and features, I do not think I need to write much about it after 6 months of this device launch. I will simply post a 1-10 rating for each perspective.Performance: 7 (Occasional hiccups)Display: 9 (You already know about this)Ergonomics: 9 (Don't believe those saying its design looks outdated)Memory: 8 (in terms of multitasking)OS/Software: 9Rear camera: 7Front camera: 8Video capture: 8Battery: 10 (You might have already seen this coming, Gives me 10-12h screen usage)Miscellaneous - Face unlock & Fingerprint sensor: 9, Audio output from speaker: 7, Bluetooth connectivity: 7, WiFi reception: 9, Call through earpiece: 8, Body material: 6 (for using such a slippery plastic back), Heat dissipation: 4 out of 10The major issue I had handling this phone was due to this getting heated on the upper side of display, most probably due to a bad conductor of heat at its back. I haven't played a single game and I've stopped playing games on a phone long ago, so it's just the many shopping, social media apps and browsers that I multitask between. I ordered a flip cover along with the phone since AMOLEDs are thin glass, needs care while handling, but I couldn't use this phone with the flip more than a day! The upper part of display was heating up like a metal kept in sun. Such heating systems can permanently harm the motherboard and battery elements inside, along with your ears if you take calls at such times. I have also used my friend's Galaxy M20 and even that outdated device with 3GB RAM or so and a bad processor has better heat management.It gets mildly heated while keeping in the pocket, while charging, while multitasking a lot between social media and content downloading apps, every now and then even though I'm not a rough or heavy user. My screen usage a day stays within 6-9 hrs. I returned the flip and ordered a soft plastic back cover with a fabric design (You can get it at 149 from Amazon, it has holes on the back for air venting) but even that couldn't make it through more than 10 days of usage. Initially, it was handling heating fine but after a few days I again noticed similar heating issue. I returned it again and now I have ordered a plastic case, which simply holds it on edges and open on the buttons side and upper and bottom sides, hopefully for better ventilation. Doing fine since laat 2 days of use, but this doesn't provide any protection to display. It's just that I happen to be very cautious while handling my gadgets so I know it will survive for years in my hands. I never encountered such heating issues in my Asus Max Pro M1 with a metal back and rugged cover over it, even during heavy gaming and multitasking. It was there but on very rare occasions though. I have seen Samsung India responding to reviews here so, take a Note, Samsung.Verdict: I'm posting this on 2nd Oct, and I think still looking at the competition of the kind of products in this range, M21 is a good buy. If you can manage with the heating issue, which if you use with a partially-open back cover (the one in pic) or without any cover at all, won't be there. I wanted a phone I don't need to run for a charger every now & then, it checks that point quite well.Leave a Like to this review if you think this helped you choose a better option. Cheers.

  I bought it for my brother @12699 on 24 May 2020So, I will list the most practical things I like about this device.* I personally care more about the screen of a device, be it mobile, Laptop or computer monitor. As whatever you consume, it comes through that screen only. AMOLED screen make the visual experience so much rich, plus it consumes lesser battery from a already monstrous one. This is the main reason for me to go for this device. I would always recommend anyone to pickup an AMOLED screen over a LCD one* Bloatware free Android distribution, as good as Android one stock. No ads like you will find many in Chinese Handset. If I have to gift a mobile to my family member. I pick android one or a equivalent clean OS device, like this one.* Most intuitive UI in android, Samsung's One UI. (Yes, you must get hands-on with Samsung's one UI device toexperience it). The way they have made it possible for users to navigate to the items with single hand is what even Google couldn't do after so many years. That too, when phone screen sizes are 6.x inches nowadays. The UI is very responsive and day to day experience is glitch free* This devices comes with a big battery and with 6.4 inches screen and phone doesn't feel bulky. Also, battery compartment, you don't even need any review for that. Backup of 2.5 days under normal usage very much possible* Great camera for your day-to-day moments. Night mode really makes a difference. Can capture and see lightning at 240fps, the same thing I do on my much expensive Galaxy S9* Feature rich phone. Video editor, Photo editor, movie maker are out of the box from Samsung itself. Very useful app which people often download from unreliable third party vendors**********Some downsides************ Not for heavy gamers. However, PUBG is possible in HD settings, if you can play it in India ;)* Today, you might get a 90Hz display at this price. But again, if I have to pick between refresh rate and AMOLED, I personally will pick AMOLED* 15 W fast charging. Needed more W's for a 6000mah battery*********Who all can look for this device***********************Anyone who cares for rich visual experience, rich media consumption, casual gaming, forget to charge their device, need good camera and most important good value of their money.

  Reviewing it after using for more than 10 days. Samsung galaxy M21 is very handy and classic looking mobile and light weight as well even though having huge mah battery.Features like 48 MP excellent camera, super amoled display, and 6000 mah huge battery in this price range is considerable. Processor is also great ( You can Play PUBG, COD smoothly) though Snapdragon processor is obviously better than Exynos for games. I loved the display most. Fingerprint reader is fast no issues at all. Other supplimentry features are also useful, no ads like Redmi mobiles show. Camera is far better than other mobiles in this price range and most attractive features is 'Night Mode'. Battery life is more than one and half day to 2 days depending on uses. Only thing I didn't not like that with 6000mah battery Samsung giving 15 Watt charger, very strange thing. No other issues I noticed like lagging, heating etc.So finally my conclusion is that if u are a normal user(not a gamer) and want a super amoled display, good camera, huge battery and good looking mobile then this is a perfect mobile for you in this price segment.

  My first non-chinese smartphone.😀( In fact Matter of pride for me).Good product but Samsung need to do some more QC about fit and finish(however improvement over M30s).Lack few features compare to counterparts(Gorilla Glass 5, metal/GG5(not my favorite) back cover) but has some exclusive great additions too (sAmoled, 6000 mAH). So it's a give and take. However one can not compete with those who are known tech. thieves.Comes with lot of uninstallable bloatware(Facebook/Netflix/MS cloud to name a few).A daily data counter (usages info.) in notification drawer and a icon to lock screen display is a necessary inclusion Samsung must think about.Processor is good contrary to general belief. Can handle some pretty heavy apps which SD 636 (RN5P) couldn't handle with same memory config.( PS:I am not a Gamer).Overall impressed. My next phone will also be a Samsung when my other phone(RN8P) completes its threshold.Will update my review once return period is over/ after a month's use)And Samsung please care to add a cheap plastic cover and screen protector. Will be life saver till one buys a good one.

  Writing the review after usage of 40 daysPros1. Awesome battery life, lasts up to 48 hrs of decent usage.2. Super amoled display makes visuals more crispy in indoors.3. Camera hardware is good, camera software of Samsung requires update.. overall a good camera.Ultra wide angle is really wonderful. Front camera is decent.4. Processor is good, with 6 GB RAM hardly any lag in using multiple applications simultaneously.5. Samsung UI is lighter than miui and certainly holds all the features like coloros or miui.6. Preinstalled apps hold about 17 GB in phone and rest abt 103 GB available for usage.Cons1. Battery takes about 160 mins to charge fully with fast charger.2. Screen is prone to scratches , a screen guard is must.3. Back cover is needed as the back is all plastic and gets scratches even inside the cover due to small dust particles... Should have a glass back panel as well.4. Fingerprint sensor takes some time , and difficult to sense if your fingers are moist.OverallValue for money, a good option of you are looking for a non Chinese phone with decent configuration and don't have a budget for an iPhone.

Then not respond from Amazon while not a phisical damage or problem its logical problem and Amazon should pickup the item . Any one help me please.

  It's been over a month since I have been using the phone.Camera : Camera performance is not that great. Don't expect any exceptional performance. I find camera of Poco F1 was great when compared. Overall gives a decent performance. Don't pick if you are buying phone just because of camera.Battery: Battery performance is excellent. Initially It struggled to last even one day but then I removed a lot of pre-installed apps and the performance increased. It would last for a day for a heavy user (not gamings all the time Ofcourse, but social apps).Ram/Performance:I do have plenty of apps, yet it works smooth.This phone comes up with a lot of preloaded apps, you may remove some but won't be able uninstall all apps (e.g. Netflix).Overall it's a decent deal at the price coming from Samsung.

  Excellent - amoled screen, speaker volume, camera, no problem in network coverage, battery backup is awesome (1.5 - 2days), design and quality. Trust me you wont regret, buying this phone. Thanks Amazon & Samsung

  Product is good.Camera is average. Night shot is below average considering price.Build quality is very poor using cheap plastic material, back cover not included.Battery life about 1.5 days.Face unlock is good.Network reception is low, good if your area has high network otherwise you may face issue while traveling.Delivery of product by Amazon is average this time I faced.Processor is lillte low compared to Snapdragon.Amoled display quality is only main point and it is very good with bright and punchy colors.It's proximity sensor is not work well.Charging takes time with 15w fast charger included in box.#Conclusion-Go for #Vivo_U20 in my opinion. You can see comparison video in youtube. It has sd675Aie processor with best camera quality not high resolution but gives better output. Also has 5000 mah battery with fast charging.Thnak you..

  Very pathetic experience. Within one month its screen freezed and sometimes opens functions automatically. I visited customer support service, they upgraded the software and it begins to work properly but after returning from service centre the same problem occurred again.I have used five smart phones previously and was happy but this one scattered all my concept regarding this brand. I recommend not to buy this.After experiencing costumer care support I'll edit the review again.

  I m a fan of Samsung mobile phones and the sound quality is very good ,camera clarity outstanding

  Best Phone at this price pointJust go for it blindly.Before I purchased a Samsung M30s which was a Gamechanger from Samsung.This one is the small brother of M30s.Same features at just 14k.

  I don't what Samsung is thinking before sending this smartphone it's a worst I have ever seen I think they didn't even check this smartphone for one's this phone front camera is totally useless and now we r facing problem and won't able to return thisAfter a long process finally we got replacement of our phone now it is working properly and overall good phone

  Average phone in comaprison to other company phones.Camera ok not so great. Images looks darker. I had samsung onmax earlier. Camera was better than this phone.Batter backup getting for 1 day.Speed is good, not getting hang as of now.Screensize is big. U need to operate with both hands.difficult with one hand..Rest same features as all samsung phone.,, got slow motion camera and qr code scannor addition in this model.Just have trust on samsung, so bought it. Hope phone work for longer leriod. Finger crossed.

  I was looking for a phone for my mom with the below requirements in the exact order of priority:1. Non Chinese2. Good battery life3. Decent display4. Performs reasonable well5. Decent cameraAnd if I had to review it, I'd buy it for those exact reasons too. The battery is a beast. You just cannot drain it in a day. She charges it once in 2-3 days. Camera is average at best. I'm using a poco which clicks much better images even though it is a 2 year old camera in comparison. Comes with a lot of bloatware preinstalled by Samsung which is mostly removable. And the display is just stunning. Amoled feels so much better. It gets very bright and comfortable to use under direct sunlight. Perfect phone if raw performance is not your priority. Perfect for non gamer patriotics. By far the best phone by samsung value for money

"
"

  I am posting this review upon using this device for 5 days.-Camera is ok, I would like to mention ""Megapixels "" doesn't work if you really don't have the quality camera, but for the money what you pay it's okay to bare 😜-Display is pretty decent-Battery is a monster yet it takes time to fully charge 3hrs needed from 20% to 100%, but you won't have to search for a charger for whole day(I am not a gamer hence don't know how it will work with gamers )If you are really looking for a budget friendly phone go for it.

  Not satisfied with samsung galaxy m21.1. Charging problem, this is fast charging but when connected to charger not connected every time. You have to look time to time if it is charging or not.2. Battery back up is well but not as 6k mAh.3. Fingerprint is not fast every time.4. Touch is not also working well every time.5. Sometimes while playing YouTube light dropped automatically that makes me disappointed.6. Slight hanging problem that is negligible.7. Camera quality is good.8. Display  is also good.9. If software updates available and it makes the changes that need then it'll be a batter than others phone.Over all if you are a mi users you'll find it as back dated. So many features are like old though these are very useful features. But at the same time advance features are also available  in this phone. However the matter it's the best when you are fighting against the Chinese products.

"
"

  This one was choosen just not to buy any Chinese brand as more features at a lesser price were available by popular Chinese brands.But then surprised to see the camera performance even in low light. Battery nothing to mention, its 6000mah. Software smooth, i am not a gamer but heavy user of phone but have not faced any lagging so far even with 512 GB memory card installed, no hitting issue so far, charges fast reasonably but this could have been little faster. Display resolution one of the best compare to its competitors. Signal reception needs little improvement.

"
"

  I will write it very crisp. Overall it is a value for your money. Wifi calling is a breakthrough  technology.  Even in case of no network, you will enjoy hassle free incoming and outgoing  calls.Only one thing negative about it is , it doesn't  record wifi calls; neither automatically  or manually. It is a small thing I hope they will fix it soon.

  Display 10/10Build 8.5/10Camera 9/10Battery 10/10UI or OS  9/10Chipset performance 8/10 (not good for hardcore gamers)Heating performance 8/10 ( normal temperature on a higher side)Signal strength, call quality 9.5/10Value for money 10/10Recommended ? Surely go ahead, if you are not going to play pubg full time on it.

"
"

  This is gonna be a long review,so buckle up.PROS:Display- Super Amoled FHD+ display,need I say more?The always on display is great.Battery-6000mah.Will surely last you a day with even heavy usage.UI - This comes with android 10 and one UI 2.0 out of the box.Its clean and user friendly.No adds unlike some Chinese phones.Camera-Not mindblowing but fairly decent.The 48 MP camera captures good detail.Samsung branding-The phones quite light weight and ergonomic and the Samsung branding goes a long way.Cons:Charging:It comes with a 15 watt charger which is not fast enough for a 6000mah battery.It takes around 2-3 hours to charge completely.Performance-The exynos 9611 will not disappoint you for daily use but for hardcore gamers it falls short.Overall I would say M21 is a good midranger,and I would recommend a case.

"
"

  Its a great smartphone no doubt!Looks really good, screen is impressive afterall it's Samsung's AMOLED.Camera is 9/10 according to me.Clean UI with lots of features.Battery is HUGE, phone is lightweight keeping in mind its 6000mah!You will surely need a screen guard and back cover before you start using it.I bought it for my mother and she loves it. Got it for 11k in exchange for my old Galaxy On7 prime (₹3,000)Samsung over Chinese brands any day!

  The phone is a good choice in this price segment. It ticks most of the boxes. Will be a great buy unless you care for heating or gaming. I'm posting this review after 2 weeks of use.1. PERFORMANCE: Multitasking is fast. No lags faced anywhere.2. UI: Fast, customizable and sleek UI.3. CAMERA: Primary camera is good. Wide angle and portrait lens are above average. Edge detection is sometimes not good. Selfie camera works fine.4. DESIGN :Design is good but build quality is not up to the mark as its plastic.5. HEATING ISSUES: The phone gets warm slightly over the selfie camera region even with normal usage. It get a hot during minimal gaming or when using camera even for a short time or when brightness is high. Even whem charging the mobile gets heated.6. BATTERY: Battery backup is great. In 7 hrs of usage including an hour of gaming the battery drops from 100 to 30. Charging takes 3 hrs approximately.7.  GAMING PERFORMANCE: For gaming the phone is not the best in its segment but could manage games at average quality.8. BIOMETRICS: Fingerprint reader and face unlock are fast and didn't face any issues.9. DISPLAY: With super amoled screen, the display is awesome.10. SOFTWARE UPDATE: It runs only in the February version of security and not yet received any update.11. SPEAKER: Speaker is loud. Quality above average.12. CALLING: Call quality is average. Mic is not good and you have to talk a bit loud so that the other person can hear you clearly.13. ACCESSORIES:Note that you do not get a cover or a headphone with the mobile.

  Samsung Galaxy M21 is the best budget smartphone, the display is outstanding, performance is stable, OneUI is highly optimized, the battery is amazing (I read some negative comments, but honestly I didn't face any such issue. It lasted 2 days for me on moderate use.), Fast charging not too fast but better for longer battery life, too fast charging kills the battery faster.Overall it is the recommended smartphone to all the budget users. If you are planning to just heavy game on it then this is not for you.

"
"

  Cons:1. Despite 6000 mAh battery it hardly gives 1 day backup when using for calls only. But taking 3hrs to full charge.2. I noticed twice SIM card not detected.3. Sometimes finger print scanner doesn't work.4. Image/Video quality is not good when using wide angle sensor and video stabilization.5. Sound quality is not up to the mark.7. Polycarbonate metal quality looks like cheap.Pros:1. Awesome display.2. UI is also good.I think I got defective mobile, overall I'm not satisfied with this mobile, return requested, will get replacement. I will post my reviews once I use replaced unit.

  Superb smartphone,i purchased Samsung smartphones only bcoz i dont wanna purchase any Chinese smartphon.boycott Chinese products.Nice smartphone with big battery & good camera.Samsung should introduce there smartphones some other powerful processor like Snapdragon 720G,730G.other all things are good like it comes with super amoled display and ,6000 mah power full battery although if samsung could provide atleast 20 watt charger instead of 15 watt than it will be good. By the way nice phone.i purchased 64gb internal,4gb ram Variant at 13500 rps  now its price has been increased l.now this is available at 14000 for 4gb ram,64 gb internal Variant.samsung should not increase the price.

"
"

  very fluid, very responsive, very optimized.Although it miss on call recording, focus lock in video, lack of gestures.Othe than that lots of features and highly capable.Display is very very Good.fingerprint scanner is very fast.Battery life is very good and fast charger also works fine.highly recommended .most important point , its not Chinese.

"
"

  I was a MI user since decade this time searching for Non-Chinese brand and after searching for almost 2months found this charming device. I is amazing in all respect i.e. Bigger Battery life, best Camera, superfast processor and good looking too.Thanks Samsung for such a amazing device & amazon for timely delivery.

"
"

  After using my new M21 6B +128 Gb for 10 days found it just average. Camera quality is low, after 4x zoom images get highly blurred, battery stay for 16-20 hours after moderate usage, phone is bulky, rest features are just ok as getting 6 Gb Samsung phone under 15k is just fine. Was using A 50 from last 2 years which has far better user performance.

  Awesome monster by Samsung. I love this piece with all superb features. With all great features, the following are the pros and cons of the device as I found out.Pros:1. Samsung Hardware Quality! Always exceptional. I remember using my Samsung Galaxy S3 i9300. I still have it and I can match the quality of M21 with that of S3. The price is also reasonable given the features. Could be a bit low.2. Huge 6.4"" Super Amoled screen with >92% screen ratio and 1080x2340 pixels resolution is awesome. Colours and resolution is very good.3. 48 MP camera comes with awesome features like slow motion, super slow motion, time lapse, portrait, food photography, night,  panorama, and pro mode. It also includes qr code scanner and bixby vision. Video quality is also awesome. Front selfie camera is also excellent with self capture features by palm gesture. Front camera is also used for face recognition for unlocking the phone, which is again an excellent feature. Tripke camera have wide mode, depth mode and normal mode.4. Battery: 6000 mAH Lithium Polymer battery gives a monsterous backup. Even though, if you use all the features of the phone, the battery will stay for the whole day long. 15 Watt quick charging enables you to quick charge the phone and use it for the day long.5. Processor, Storage and Ram: I've bought the 6GB 128GB version,  which has sufficient storage memory and RAM to copeup with your rigourous use, let it be games, videos or applications. The monster never slows down. Samsung Exynos 9611 Octacore processor is superb. Mali G72 MP3 GPU lets you play your favourite games with more fun!6. Software: The Android 10 with One UI 2.0 is an excellent combination making the phone literally your virtual assistant. Samsung Galaxy apps are added advantages apart from the hardware quality!7. Phone is light weight and slim, though long due to its screen size, bit its neccessary for a better viewing experience.8. Loud speaker is good. Headphones support Dolby Atmos, and customizable sound profile to give you an amazing sound effect using headphones.9. Other features include USB Type C, A-GPS with Glonass and BDS, Fingerprint sensor, accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass, dual 4G LTE standby (Good for Jio users!), Screen cast inbuilt and dual sim support with seperate memory card ecpansion slot with 512 GB card support.10. Most important: Its Made in India! :)Now the Cons:1. Most needed these days is the NFC support for digital payments. Does not have NFC.2. No Earphones in the box (Samsung provides one of the best headphones). Though @Samsung says that headphones are user specific, but still I would say headphones must be included, as they are one of the best.In all, to summarize I would say that it is definitely a go for a great price of 15k for 6GB 128GB model. Great purchase with excellent features. I love my this monster.. 9.8/10.. Definitely go for it..

  My S10 screen went faulty after 9 months of purchase and it being the lockdown period all service centers were closed. I needed a good phone as I'm a trainer and my work depends on it. I've been a Samsung buyer for years now and so I chose the higher version M21 as a compromise. However to my surprise it did everything that my S10 could and had a better battery backup as compared to the S10. The only things it didn't have were fancy features like DEX and wireless charging. Functionally a better phone and much more useful than an S10. So I bought another lower end one for my elderly mother so that she could watch programs on OTT platforms and use WhatsApp without worrying about the battery draining out and also enjoy the decently big screen size which is enough to watch movies and play games. It's a good phone in the price range and everytime I feel like fixing my S10 screen I push off the thought 'cos I could get another M21 at the repair cost. It's a good purchase add against considering a Chinese phone at around the same price. Close your eyes and buy an M21 whether you're looking for a first or second or third phone.

  10-09-2020I am one of the loyal customers of Amazon from last 6-7 years. Right from daily needs to washing machine I have purchased from Amazon. I am shocked this time to experience the fraud amazon have done. As mentioned in my review dated 03-09-2020, the samsung-21 phone I bought was having major issue of volume. Hence, I opted for replacement. To which I got notification that, replacement is possible only after 9-9-2020. As per the instructions today when I again wanted to opt for replacement the window says, “RETURN WINDOW CLOSED ON 9TH”. This is complete intentional fraud with customer.03-09-2020So I purchased Samsung because I wanted to buy Indian product. But very disheartening to inform that I have received faulty product. At full volume, I am unable to hear anything. I am trying to listen WhatsApp messages with headphones on which is hardly audible & also continuously getting notification sound from background which is not of my phone.I am at loss to understand how such major fault have been ignored by Quality Assurance Team. Please do not buy this product at all.

  I purchased this phone as i had used galaxy M30 with great satisfaction and i started liking new features of samsung.The Galaxy M21 is a mid-range smartphone from Samsung with powerpunch features. I have purchased this  phone at 50 percent cost of Samsung M30 but had more features than the older phone at much lesser price.Samsung Galaxy M21 specificationsBody: Glass front, polycarbonate back and side frame, a little heavy though manageableScreen: 6.4-inch FHD+ (1080 x 2340px) attractive display with adjustable display.Rear camera: Primary 48MP, f/2.0 aperture; Ultra wide-angle: 8MP, f/2.2 aperture; 5MP depth sensor; LED flash; 2160p@30fps video recordingFront camera: 20MP, f/2.2 aperture overall an awesome featured cameras in a budget phone.Chipset: Exynos 9611: octa-core CPU (4x2.3 GHz Cortex-A73 & 4x1.7 GHz Cortex-A53), Mali-G72 MP3 GPU, it works fine in various games.Memory: 4/64GB or 6/128GB UFS 2.1; dedicated microSD slot for up to 1TB expansionOS: Android 10; Samsung One UI 2Battery: 6,000mAh, 15W chargingConnectivity: Dual SIM (4G), Bluetooth 5.0, Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac, USB-C; 3.5mm audio jackMisc: Rear-mounted fingerprint reader, FM radio is available. Dolby atmos is inbuilt and gives wonderful music experience in headphones.Though it does not gives headphones with the phone,it's a wonderful product in the price range. I can download unlimited games and apps without any lag.playing games is also not an issue.It has got a wonderfully crafted camera, pictures does comes very good.pretty good battery life at 6000 mh is its most formidable feature, you can forget charging in an outside move without worries of charging.It has an awesome performance on games. The display is good and colours are quite catchy.A good buy. It's a really wonderful phone! What a monster!!! Strongly recommended buy!!

  If you are planning to buy midrange phone with 13k to 14k then go for this, Camera quality awesome 4 ratings out of 5. 5 out 5 for battery life. Everything is goof in this phone except taking long time to charged phone(2.5 hr for 0 to 100% charging). If you are soft use then mobile battery will discharge in 2 days. which is almost better quality than other mid-range phone. Processor also fine with respect to RAM and Internal memory so no lag while playing Heavy games or application. If you are planning to buy Mid-range phone the prefer this with S-Amoled Disply.

"

  First I want to say about the processor which is I think AI based giving sufficient performance to do your daily job but you're a gamer who's playing non stop gaming without giving rest the device not this is not for you sorry. The UI given here gives lot of freedom to edit yourself like a superuser. The hardware and the software perfectly optimise as every things hands on samsung. Battery life as it mentioned Monster. I here about network issue which I faced also in my jio sim but if you perfectly in network setting then you can see the network mode is by default set in LTE/3G/2G (auto connected) which is the problem if you don't change to LTE only, because jio has only 4G network support and it doesn't have any 3G and 2G network, when the device fell that the LTE signal is become weaker then it automatically changes the network to lower suitable one, so I suggest the user who have this type of issue and using 4G sim then change the setting to LTE only. You'll get a great superb camera.I did't like the built quality where the company did price cutting for giving a AMOLED display which gets easily scratch by your surrounding recommendation to use case and temper glass as immediately you buy the product. Charging speed is too slower as compare to huge battery which is ok. Only i missing here is network speed indicator which can be resolve by a third party app but every company giving this one but samsung..?? hope they will update that one in next update .Finally best in this budget but company should provide case with the mobile.

"

  I had been using this for last one week and here are my feedback:PROS:1. Best thing is the UI. Almost like the standard Android UI2. No unnecessary apps. Even if there few pre-installed apps but it allows to uninstall them3. Battery life is good. With normal usage it is giving me backup of around 2 days(100% to 9%)4. Charging time: It takes around 2hours for 10% to 100%5. Camera: It is ok, but not something like 48mp6. No Heating problems7. Face recognitionis fine. It even recognizes in complete darkness8. Both the SIM slots are Volte enabledCONS:1. Headphone socket is at the bottom of the phone. This matters when you are using headphone but cannot place it anywhere as the headphone is connected from the bottom of the handset2. Charger Cable length is short as compared to other brands3. Settings: I struggled a lot to turn-off the vibration for notifications (final solution- we have to turn it off for each of the apps one by one)Based on these, the weightage of Pros is more than Cons. So, we can go for this product :)

  My name is Tarachand Sharma, who is in the Pali district of Rajasthan, I am buying a Samsung phone 21, but its battery is not running, I have been trying to return it for 3 days but so far I am not getting any answer and Nor is any policy in the show going on in this product, I am very nervous,Rubbish phone is a total loss deal, my advice is to people who buy this phone and whatever product they are buying from Amazon site, I do not buy a lot of items, there is some defect in everything and they do not even return.

"
"

  hello , this was my first smartphone from amazon.. i have never used an android phone before, i ordered this  phone, samsung galaxy M21 on sale last month in august only, initially i clicked pics with the phone and the picture quality was pretty good but when i clicked the same pics with flash on, there was a blue tiny in the pics.. i thought may be its because of some lighting effect  but later i tried clicking pics in day light, at night.. indoor, outdoor. but still i faced the same issue, i had been to the service center they said camera is faulty. but they cannot exchange the phone. though they can repair it.. i'm skeptical will the camera work properly after repair or may for sometime it will work and who knows later the issue will be there again? also there is problem in speaker and microphone! voice is not clear while talking.Now who will take the responsibility, they must check the product before selling..overall this purchase was a waste of moneysamsung is a good brand but they should take the responsibility if customer is facing issue, the customer service at the service center is worst! i didnt see a single happy customer over there who have got a good resolution!

  Had read here in most of the other reviews that the phone has severe heating issues and sincerely hoped that this wouldn't be the case with my device. Here's my review:1. Looks and feels like a mid- to high-end device. A bit slippery, so you might have to get a back/flip cover2. Chose this for my mom due to its low SAR rating, a few people had pointed out that this resulted in low network strength. This has not been the case for my device. Network strength remains unchanged from the previous handset3. Battery life remains its biggest plus point. Lasts more than a day easily with moderate to heavy usage. For a day or two, the battery doesn't seem like it is 6000 mAH. However in about 4-5 days, it adapts itself and there is a considerable difference and one can see that it lasts longer.4. Low to Moderate heating issues. My mother prefers a flip cover anyways, so that is easily masked in this case.5. Camera quality is above average. Make sure to change the settings to highest quality images. The default setting is for low quality. This has caused a lot of people to comment that the image quality is poor.6. The resolution is perfect and bezels remain as low as possible. Its the closest you can get to highest resolution in this phone range.7. Chose the 4gb/64 gb variant due to negligible gaming needs. For now, that serves the purpose perfectly. There's no lag during browsing or app change as such.8. Samsung device, so no hassles with bloatware that comes pre added with the like sof Xiaomi or Oppo or Vivo.All in all, a very decent mid-range device that should last for 2-3 years, which is the normal life of a cell-phone these days.

"

  Phone is good!There is an issue when merging conference call. It will hang the calls on hold and you have to disconnect all the calls. Camera nothing great. Battery is very good. Fast charging and normal charging time almost the same. Finger print reader does not work if your finger is sweat. Lot of blotwares on software update. Latest software update was 1 GB and it consists of Payu money app and other blotware apps. Recomending to factory reset and uninstall all those blotwares. Some blotware apps are not allowed to uninstall so just have to disable it manually. Samsung keyboard simply refuses to show sometimes even if I am in typing mode, microphone gives echo effect to the receivers when I make calls, chrome app hangs, wifi both 2.4 ghz and 5ghz tends to disconnect internet automatically if your signal strength is low. Even if we have dual sim capability on this phone, recommended to use one sim because the performace of your phone in terms of network and hardware features will be very limited when you are using duel sim

  I liked this phone.. battery back up is awesome .. but yes. It takes approx 2 Houston's full charge..camea is also goodThis is the best phone in this range in the entire market..I was scared while buying it as I was not a fan of samsung Mobiles, but thank god, this phone met n exceeded my expectations

"

  I purchased Samsung M21 a month ago and I'm simply impressed with its performance.Battery:The battery capacity of 6000 mah is highly reliable and last for 1.5 days with a full charge and 100% data on. The phone reaches 100% charge from 1% in about 90 minutes and once fully charged, you are on for a marathon.Camera:I was personally impressed with the camera performance. In the budget of Rs. 14,000, I by far would rate Samsung M21 as one of the best phones available in the market. Apart from Triple camera, the phone comes up with multiple camera features that would certainly engage the user.Speed and Performance:The speed of the phone is really good and does not slow down even if you open 10 applications at the same time. With 64 GB inbuilt memory expandable upto 512 GB ensures your phone is always available to load more. The seamless experience with video calls, messages and Business applications like MS teams, Outlook, Office, etc make the phone fit the Business segment.Overall, just go for Samsung M21 if you are looking for performance, features and price worthy.

"
"

  You must think twice before buying of Samsung.1.Let's take the example of Samsung M21 mobile. Speaker sound quality is very bad, no bass response.2.Call quality is very bad3.After some time you can't able to download app- will show searching for Wi-Fi even with mobile data ON. You have to clear cache files in Google Play Store and Play Services App to get rid of this problem time to time. You will never face this problem in MI or Vivo mobiles as these cache got automatically deleted after download.4.Build quality is very bad(plastic).5.Samsung unnecessarily hiked the price of all mobiles.6.UI of Samsung mobile is not all user friendly like MI.7.It is true that only display, battery and camera are good and rest is faltu.

"
"

  Its a Samsung phone, so overall quality and durability is guaranteed! Performance is good, phone does not hang, battery capacity is big at 6000 mAh, and charging is fast. The screen is an absolute beauty I must say - amazing colours and contrast, the only low point of this phone is the camera performance in dark conditions which is not bad but not good either, average performance .... also the wide-angle camera distorts the image - I hope software updates can fix the issue.

  Dear Sir/ Madam,I have purchased Samsung M21 on dated 25/07/2020 via Amazon India Online Purchase, which was delivered on 28/07/2020. But on dated 12Aug 2020, phone was not working properly as I was unable to open the pattern lock. The next day there was a small blue and pink color dot on the left side of the screen. I have contacted the Samsung  Service Centre in Mathura. They have provided a service order number 4307833776. The phone is neither damaged nor pressed with weight. They are charging money to resolve the issue, but as a rational customer I have neither damaged the phone nor put any heavy weight on it. I have purchased the phone for 17000 Rs. but within 17 days the problem has raised, the device hasn't damaged from any side/part of it.You are requested to please look into the matter and resolve it as soon  as possible so that the faith of customer remains in your esteemed organization. I have first time purchased a samsung phone but the problem raised.

"
"

  Since I lost first 3-4 days of using due to internet connection issue started using it from 4th day only.Battery life was best on day 5 - battery % was above 40 % on the second day usage with intermittent use of internet. Then it was good on the 6th day around 25 % battery was available at end of day. Had to charge before sleeping.  7th day battery is remaining 30% on the next day morning.Now the return window is closed.Repenting on buying this phone.

"
"

  Worst phone i have ever bought. I bought it on 4 July. On 26 july it has a tumb mark on screen. I went to service center but they denied to change the screen and said you have mistakenly press it and it is not our warranty. Is it possible? Because i don't press it. They want screen repair charge  5 thousands something. Its very irritating. First time i bought samsung mobile and the mobile and the services is worst. I recommend all of my colleagues and friends not to buy any samsung product. Please don't buy it.

"
"

  I bought this phone at  14k and bought a hard case and screen guard at 1k, overall at 15k got a very good phone.The only lesser feature i got from this is the camera rest is all good for the price. Its important to know that we wont get a back cover for this price and since its a plastic back its better to buy a back cover preferably a hard case for protection

"
"

  Best display, Best Camera, Best Battery under 14000 price range.From back It looks cheap because of the polycarbonate material, but if you apply a cover, you can easily  hide this disadvantage.The Super Amoled display is amazing you will love that.Pros : Amazing Camera picture quality, Big 6000 MAH battery, Super Amoled  display, clean User Interface.Cons : Cheap Polycarbonate body, Gorilla  Glass 5 protection missing as GG 3 protection  given, Processor could be better.

  Best budget phone in recent times. SAMSUNG proved that brand is a brand always.6000 mah batteryExcellent camera(48mp and 20mp)Dolby atmos feature (on headset)Full HD screenAmoled screenAll these for 12699/-Undoubtedly the beast in battery backup.For pubg gamersIt runs smoothly on Smooth and extreme option. FYI I am not a big gamer to review on this.

"
"

  It is a good phone for day to day use with superb camera quality and very good battery life .with awesome screen display quality but sometimes there is a little frame drops notice able good for gaming like pubg and all . No lags noticable or frame drops during game play no heating issue but the problem is that it stratus between using apps sometimes which is not at all a big issueThe best phone under 14000 a person could getI myself highly recommend this phone 😃😃😃😃

"

  Well I feel bad while writing this review but the phone is not up to the expectation. Battery drains out relatively quickly and takes a bit of time to get fully charged. The fingerprint reader is good and sensitive. The camera is of decent quality and you can click clear images with it. Samsung can seriously work on UI improvements. It feels that I am using outdated UI. To be honest I ordered it only because I did not want to order Chinese phone. Overall 3 star rating from my end.

  It is a good option for normal users. But don't buy these mobile for gaming. Gaming is not bad But we are playing high graphical games like pubg, call of duty, it may be lags. Camera is awesome in day light. But low light visibility is not good.Display there was no smartphone under 15000 to beat samsung galaxy m21. Battery is good but dont seems to be a 6000mah it drains like 5000 mah. Fast charging is not good it would take 2.45 hrs to charge 0% to100%. Design is not good it is plastic design which was dont look like premium.When you are a heavy gamer than you go for realme 6.when your preference is camera and design go for redmi note 9 pro. Comparing to realme 6 and redmi note 9 pro i choose m21 because of super amoled screen and a huge battery life and m21 is cheaper than these 2 smartphones

  Well this phone, the screen, the battery, the camera and every hardware aspect is way good at this price. I just love watching videos on this screen; on a single day use, I don't need to charge it, even for once and the camera is good. I'm using this for two months and there is this issue about VoLTE. The VoLTE sign often stops showing, sometimes the connection jumps from LTE to 2G and wouldn't show 4G, unless restarted or the flight mode is switched on and off. At first I thought it was my SIM operator's problem. I called them and they informed it was device's problem. So, I googled it and turns out, a lot many people using various SIM operators are facing the same issue. Although it seems to be software bug and I hope they rectify it with future updates. Also the fingerprint scanner gets smudgy and wouldn't work, often. I don't play games on phones, so I don't how the processor holds on gaming; the user interface is smooth though.

  Review after using 15 days.This phone feels good in hand. Priced at reasonable rate. Screen is good, sound is clear. There are few cons.1) Camera quality is very bad. Back camera is claimed 48 MP but photos in low light are of very poor quality. Selfie camera quality is also very bad. I give only 2 stars for camera because of OS of camera. Better samsung should give less MP with good quality images.2) Video playback is not good. Videos shot on other mobile hangs a lot.Initially I got a problem of very slow charging speed during even fast charge mode. Then Amazon care guided me some trouble shoot and ask to drain full battery and then charging the mobile. This helped and speed of charging improved. But mobile tower signal is low compared to other brand with same network and same place. Also video Play back of stored video is poor.Overall good mobile compared to samsung M30s but not with competitor brands. Only samsung lovers can like this phone.I recommend to go with MI note 8 pro or note 9 pro at this budget.

  First of all hats off to Amazon's delivery even in stormy weather they delivered it next day of order.Packaging could have been better though.I believe the phone box should have been placed in a cardboard box and then should have been wrapped in bubble wrap and plastic.About phone now.It is an absolute delight to look at and use super AMOLED display. The phone comes with a ton of preloaded apps many of which can be removed though. Both camera set ups, rear and front are nice though. Image comes a little bit warmer in tone. Speaker sound quality is loud and clear. Battery back up is marvelous. Media streaming experience is great. You get Dolby Atmos sound with headphones on. Network reception is great and emhced with WiFi calling.All in all phone is a little bit overpriced, but may be justified by sAMOLED display.

  After one month of usage I have posted this review.1) Camera: Above average2) Battery: Excellent (for normal usage upto 2 days)3) Display: Amazing as expected4) Performance: For normal daily usage no any lag noticed.5) Built quality: As it is Samsung device so built quality is solid.6) In device ads: No any ads or recommendations noticed you just need to disable discover option in the settings.7) Bloatware: Some preinstalled apps were present but you can uninstalled it.So overall experience is excellent. If you are looking for perfect device for normal usage then you can definitely go for it.

  I bought this phone for my mother. So the phone is not being used for gaming. The load on RAM and processor is quite high since a lot of apps run in background as my mother doesn't close them when not in use. The phone has been working fine and there are no complaints till date.M21 is a very good phone by Samsung in its segment.Processing and RAM usage : The phone's processing is good and also the amount of memory used by the apps and OS is decent. At any point of time you would have 1.2/4 GB available with basic apps installed. The response from the phone on app launch/navigation is pretty decent, neither it's very fast nor is it very slow.Camera: The camera quality is very competitive in this segment. No complaints here.Sensors : Face Recognition is a bit slow but fingerprint recognition is fast.Screen: The screen is awesome. The colour and depth are in detail.Battery Life: Battery life is amazing since it has 6000 mAh battery. Charging time is also quite efficient.Build Quality: The phone's build quality and finish is very good.Overall Rating : 4.2 /5

  Samsung M21 is a awesome phone.Battery life is very good after one charge it is run one and half day if normal useage.Fingerprint sensor is very fast.Super amoled screen is really very nice.Rear Camera shot nice pictures and also front camera is very good.Processor is good and phone run very smooth but yes I'm not a game lover.I just found one con after one week useage battery take 3 hour to charge from zero to 100%. 15watt charger is not enoughOVERALL Phone is a real monster.

  Writing this review after using the phone for 45 days.This is my first samsung phone.Utterly disappointed by the performance. Did go through the reviews before buying the phone where I found some mixed answers.i guess I should not have overlooked people's concerns which they posted here.so here I go with what I have been facing ever since I bought it.1) battery takes 2.5 hours to completely charge.so don't go by the mentioned spec fast charging ..phones back in 2010 also did not take 2.5 hours to completely charge.2)phone's width makes it look ugly..after putting tampered glass and back cover,it will look extra thick.3)frequent lagging.4)by any chance if you are a pubg gamer ,this phone is definitely not for u.heats up in one match and lags like hell.pubg runs 10 times better in my old moto g5,Nokia 6.1 and realme c2.5)camera quality is average.you won't get 48 mp feeling for sure..6)the only good thing about the phone is it's finger print senser.Kindly consider these points before u think of buying this phone..

  It's almost 3 months since I got this monster at 12.5k. I'll mention the Pros. & Cons.:-PROS1. A good brand at a reasonable price.2. Amazing camera for daily users.3. Battery backup is more than good.4. Ergonomically designed, so easy to hold in  hands.5. Dolby Atmos Integrated.CONS.1. Battery backup not as expected from a  6000mAh battery.2. Phone speed drastically decreased by 20-  25% after 10-12 days of usage.3. A 14watt fast charger is provided which  takes around 3 hours to juice up from 0-  100% & it's too much. (I would rather prefer  a fast charging phone over big battery size)4. A poly carb. back cover looks cheap.Conclusion-- The only thing that makes me happy after buying this device is, this is not a chinese brand. The performance is average. If you are looking for a better performance, please go for Redmi.

  I am using this phone from last one week. This  is the best budget phone under 15k.It has huge battery. It last for one and half day with moderate usage. three times my old phoneI am normal user. Camera is good as well.  Only one problem is it takes time to full recharge 3 hours from 0 - 100% but that is something we can adjust atleast I am not going for chinese phone.

  Processor  is not a good one. Hangs a lot. While shooting  video screen gets extremely  hot... camera  could be more better.In this phone only screen quality  and battery  life is good rest is not justifying  its price. I WOULD SAY THATIt could be priced10000 rupees.Don't  buy if you have a heavy  usage, even if you don't  play  game. I won't  work for a quality  game  play. It gets hanged and hot. Not able to play videos properly  after shoot....It's good for normal average  usage not good for the technical  people.

  Hi I am now using this phone for last one month. So I feel like reviewing it.1st fingerprint scanner= it's good but I truly don't feel that wow feeling while using it even sometimes don't respond on 1st attempts but it also may be for dust sometimes so 4 star.2nd battery life= it easily give u 24 hours battery life from 95%-20% but it doesn't give u feel like 6000 mah battery feeling feel like around 4000 mah. That's why I'll give 3.53rd camera quality = don't going to pixel ppi factors in detail but simply when i click a photo in  bright condition it gives a rich photo looks good detailing also not bad but yes nothing extraordinary but and video is also decent yeah slightly lacks stability. So I'll give 44th heating issue= yes it has if u use it for streaming around  2 hrs constantly it heats up but frankly most of mid range smartphones heats up at least from my last 6 yrs experience I can say that but yes snapdragon would have performed little better in this case.I'm not a gamer so I cant share that experience.In short, I must say I'm quite a happy buyer because overall performance according to my necessity it performs well. above mentioned points are just device's pros and cons.

  Awesome budget friendly smartphone from Samsung.1.Best display in this range AMOLED is far better than LCDs. A ""U"" cutout AMOLED is better than a punch hole LCD. The software takes full advantage of AMOLED in dark mode. Perfect display for binge watchers.2.Performance is good enough for a normal user (not a Gamer). The phone heats up on gaming far easier than its counterparts. So not a performance issue for most of the users.3.Coming to battery life this beast can last up to 2 days for a casual user. Giving upto 11hours of on screen time. Even with over 5 hours of zoom calls daily zoom calls plus the causal usage one cannot kill this phone in a day. So nice for students looking for a battery beast to last full day of online classes.4. This phone does not live upto to its competitors in the camera department. Sure it has a 48MP primary lens, but the photos come out over saturated and struggle in low light conditions. But give it enough natural light and it pics come out pretty good.5. Software: this field is unbeatable in case of Samsung's ONE UI 2.0 one of the best custom skins over the already good enough Android 10. Not a fan of Samsung's apps but sometimes of them like Samsung calender, clock , calculator are better than the Google alternatives. Also as the phone will get 2 major software updates till android 12 it is a future proof beast.That's all so overall I will give this smartphone a 9.8/10 for checking all the necessary boxes for a good smartphone at this price range.✌️

  I was using Redmi note 6 PRO for almost 1 year, and I Bought M21 in Exchange offer in Amazon,  The exchange Offer is Awesome, I dont think any Local Retailer would be able to give the Same Exchange amount as Amazon.After 1 week of Usage, I feel the Phone is Pretty good for the Day to day Basic functions.  I would like to compare it with my Redmi note 6 PRO.Performance Wise, I thought the Redmi note 6 was Slightly Better, but I dont see Significant difference between Redmi and M21.  Overall the performance of the Phone is decent for the price you pay.I am not Fan of Games, and I cant comment on Performance of the phone while you Play Games, But I think it cannot be used for Playing Games such as PUBG.The Redmi note 6 PRO has 4000maH battery,whilst M21 has 6000maH,  However I see that the battery life Both Phones were almost the same with Moderage Usage.  This was very Disappointing on M21 as 6000maH Battery was the highlight of the Phone, and One would expect more Battery life on M21. Sadly thats the not the case.I am not saying battery Life is bad, You would get the same life which you get on any Phone that has 4000MaH, However thats not what you expect from 6000maH Battery.One Important thing I would like to mention about M21 is that, all notitifications works pretty Weel on M21.  Its not only with M21, but with all Samsung Phones for that matter. I am talking about the Apps such Outlook, Skype for Business etc.  The Notifications for skype Never works on Redmi, for Outlook it works someties, and sometimes it doesnt.  But It has been working fine with all my official apps on M21.  It may not be relevant to everyone, but for a person who keeps checking their phone for their Outlook and skype messages, it matters a Lot.  I have also noted the same Issue with Other Apps on Redmi Phone. If you guys are familiar with Mygate, I never used to get E-intercomm Call on MyGate ( This was the same on Redmi and also my RealME ( MyWife's Phone).  I would say, when it comes to User interface and User experience Samsung defeats all other Chines Made Phones which are available in the market.Another Point I want to add is that, I have Samsung Galaxy Ear Buds which I was using it with Redmi Phone, and it never used to work. I used to face frequent voice cut with the earphone, but now with Galaxy it works like a Charm.  The Galaxy Ear Buds is designed for only Galaxy Phones.  In case anyone is planning to buy it, get it only if you have a Samsung, else it will be a waste of Money.

  I got my M21 on 21M (21st May). Been using it since and it's been brilliant.Pros:Amazing displayGreat cameras for day light and ample artificial light photosGreat battery (even though it isn't optimized yet, it's giving great backup)Good RAM managementFeature packedCons:Bad low light photosAll in all, a great phone at the price. Couldn't have asked for more.Edit- after more than a month of using:The battery life is amazing - its providing me 12-13 hours of screen on time with more than 2 days of moderate use.Camera is amazing: Bokeh effect, ultra wide photography, pro modes etc are working perfectly fine - can even compare them to my old oneplus phone. The only problem is low light photos - they are bad.Display and screen quality is top notch.

  What I didn't like is-1) when I received the package, the box inside outer plastic package and bubble wrap was torn, its sticker which prevents the box from opening was also torn.I thought I would have to return the product (I have also took video of opening), but then thought about giving a benifit of doubt and switched on the phone, to my surprise the Android was starting up for the first time. So I kept the phone.If I keep this incidence aside, I would have given a five star rating.2) because of the big screen to body ratio, it is hard to hold the phone without activating any functions near the screen edges.Pros-1) first time after old Nokia feature phone days I am charging the phone only twice a week.2) Super AMOLED display is really crisp and efficient3) smooth running, smooth charging4) no heating up.5) good camera features.

  This device is great for handling daily tasks smoothly and you can do gaming also. But you can't play high end games like pubg for long time. I mean, you can play pubg in this smartphone but only for shorter time like 30 minutes at full battery then it will start lagging very much. You can't  play competitively. At the end, if you want a gaming smartphone don't  buy it but if you want a good smartphone as a daily driver you can go for it without a second thought. It's battery, screen quality and software optimisation makes it a very good smartphone in this price range.

  I wanted to try samsung make the very first time and bought this mobile phone, overall found the battery backup and display quality good. did not face any call related issues either voice or data. But speaker phone seems to be off a bit, faced issues conversing when on speaker. I can see clear panel gaps with screen not properly sticked to the below panel which I never faced in this price range of 13k when compared with Mi or Xiaomi. Did not want to replace it due to hassle process of replacement and all. overall an ok-ok phone.

"

  Everybody would have provided review.Phone is great. I have received it today so will update more after use.The most important thing to note is - Preloaded apps which couldn't be uninstalled or deleted.  Unfortunately this is problem in lots of custom ui phones.I hope Samsung listen to buyers and atleast give features to uninstall these app.For instance I don't want Facebook app on my phone, I don't want so many irritating app from Samsung but I have to keep it in my phone.@Samsung please take this feedback. Otherwise you are great. That one star less on rating is because of preloaded apps.

  I am writing this product review after using it for almost 12 days. First thing you will like about this device is its super AMOLED display, its the best quality display out there. The build quality is just fine it comes with gorilla glass 3 protection but its better to put on a case and a glass screen protector to avoid any scratches,  believe me you don't want to scratch that beautiful super amoled display. Samsung UI is better with no ads. The phone is very well optimized. It cleans the junk files and frees up  ram and storage by itself every day at midnight. The processor handles every day task quite easily, doesn't have any heating issues. It has a massive 6000mah battery which generally takes 2 to 2&half hrs for charging with the 15Watt fast charger bundled inside the box. The battery can easily give you 1& half day of usage (ie 9-10hrs of screen on time). Initially it calliberates the battery usage and charging speed so don't get worried. Ram management is done nicely, i was surprised to see a YouTube video start from where I left the night before. Little things to like about this device are Samsung keyboard,  Samsung switch, cleaner UI etc. Audio from the headphone is quite impressive, it has the Dolby Atmos Audio effects. Haven't spent much time on camera yet but during my brief exposure i find it working fine, shutter speed is fast, quickly saves the images and has different shooting modes (night, pro, food, super slo mo, hyperlapse AR emoji etc). Image quality is fine and well detailed. A lot of people have complained about its network reception  issues but I  can assure you the network reception is just fine. Actually if you switch from certain chinese phones you will notice a slight network drop but Samsung has optimized the phone to emit less radiation (have low SAR value) which are against the ethics of chinese manufacturers.  If you notice any network issues then contact your network operator to solve the issue, i was Initially facing some troubles in internet connectivity on my BSNL 3g network which was finally solved by the network operator. There is no issues with the phone. Final verdict- You cannot find any other made in India phone with such features in this price range There is either Samsung Galaxy M21/ M31. So just go for it. I am glad that I again switched to Samsung after a brief experience with my Realme device.

  I bought this product in INR 13999 and I am writing this review after use of 1 month.Following are the best features of this phone I liked:-1. 6000mAh battery:I keep wifi turned ON whole day & watch videos on mobile. Still my phone battery never drained to 50% mark in 24hrs.On normal day, it drains to 70% mark in 24hrs. When I used it heavily, it drained max upto 56% mark in 24hrs.2. 15W type C chargingCharging is quite quick compared to older phone chargers.3. DisplaysAMOLED is quite cool. If you watch video at night in quite dark, you will feel like your watch in Cinema Hall.Experience is quite well compared to older IPS screens. It does not hurt your eyes in dark.4. SoundSound is rich. Call/Music sound quality is very good. Plus ""Dolby Atmos"" sound system is there for more effects.5. Camera QualityQuality is good and includes all the latest features like wide angle, super depth, night vision etc. Selfi quality is quite good.6. In-built Caller IDI detects spam calls quite accurately. You will not need to depend on TrueCaller kind of apps if you use them only to detect if incoming unknown number is Spam or not.7. AI used in One UI 2.0Time to time, you will experience that they have used AI to help you use some settings effectively.It has many other good features but I enlisted those which really make it Stand Out in a crowd of smartphones for me.I ensure you will not regret buying this one.

  I'm in love with this phone. I think its the best in its segment i.e. the below 15k mark. The sAmoled display is just superb and is worth the money. The super large battery is good but the charger is slow (a little). Tge camera quality is mind-blowing and captures crisp and clear photos. The front camera is super good too. The processor is just a little less powerful than of its competitors, good for low to moderate gaming. It does a fabulous job in day-to-day tasks and will not lag. Highly recommended. And one more thing you might get confused in between realme 6i and m21. I too got confused but if you are a gamer and don't care for your privacy go for realme 6i. But if you are a normal user who wants to surf net, get crisp quality photos, get a wonderful sAmoled display. Go for M21 without any hesitation. Best in its segment.

  #camera quality is average(3/5)#heating issue more(some times feel like it going for burn)# display is good#battery life- display consuming too much of power for working.. So we will get maximum1.5 days life.Actually I facing heating issues with this phone.. I had called 4,5times for replacement. But Amazon people telling that heating level is normal as per their policy. At the end of the long talk they escalated this issue for a agent to visit and conform. That guy called and asked issue and told that he is not able to come for this type of issues in this covid situation.. Finally they closed this issue and still facing heating issue if I use it Condinusly for 1 hr. I really fed up with this phone and replacements policy and I stopped buying costly products from Amazon.. It is like we taking a risk...

  Samsung galaxy M21 is a good phone for an ordinary or average mobile phone user.Fingerprint sensor: GoodCamera quality : Good for this price but in some aspects redmi note 9 pro is better and in some aspects samsung is betterDesign quality: good, but redmi note 9 pro has a better finish and outer bodyRam management: good and better compared to redmi note 9 proDisplay : samsung always the best display sAMOLED compared to IPS display of redmi note 9 proSpeaker: just average redmi has a better speakerBattery: M21 has a very good battery compared to other phones in this range i.e. 6000mAhGaming: Its Ok for normal and smaller games for ample time but in this aspect the redmi note 9 pro is a better gaming phone.Internet streaming: For those who watches movies, streams in web, youtube,instagram,facebook.... etc. M21 is a lot better in this than other phones in this range.Security: M21 is more secure than chinese phonesUpdates: Its got good updates regularly.If you need a better camera go for M31 or higher but for an ordinary user M21 is more than enough.After all choosing this phone depends on your preferences and needs.But you will get the BRAND Samsung at this range as well compared to chinese phones._ For Indian users

  As the title suggests, it is monster in few terms. However many features are not so monstrous!Pros:1) Amazing display and look2) Slow and hyper motion feature is impressive.3) Super fast finger scanner.4) Doesnt hangs or heat quickely.Cons:1) Average camera, only few features such as close up bokeh effect click good pictures.2) Back camera is okay in sunlight but worst in room light. It looks like 5 mega pixel not 48!3) Battery drains fast!!! Yes you heard right. Few minutes of normal activities such as clicking photos and 7% will be gone.4) High price! Paid extra because it was not made in china.

  Great Camera, excellent screen and superb battery. Dont go for any chinese phone like Redmi note 9 or Realme 6i etc, please compare online this phone has better rating than any Chinese phone and is similarly priced plus Samsung dont do petty tactics of stocking out and flash sale concept to boost sales, a good product doesnt need such gimmicks anyways. Chinese phones show better config on paper but they use such low quality items that they dont last 1 year also. Camera may be 60 80 or may be 108mp but after 6 months they produce such low quality image that phone will become useless. These issues are not there in case of samsung, plus samsung phone hangs a lot is a old theory which chinese company brought to make a hold and are not true. The phone works seamlessly.

  Am very much satisfied with this product of Samsung. Awesome battery , awesome camera , awesome display, performance is good , easy in hand feeling, back panel is somewhat glossy , looks great , face unlock is superb , fingerprint scanner is super fast n the slightest touch unlocks the phone, rise to wake gesture is working so nicely, always on display is good, I play certain games too n it's okay, With playing games n doing ng social media I charge alternate days I bought 4gb 64 gb variant. 6gb variant will give more ease in gaming n multi tasking, so I suggest to go for the higher variant, but who don't want any game , only for social media , this variant is great , go for it.

  Don’t buy this phone from Amazon this is third graded product waste of money.Such an horrible experience from amazon

  If you're from young generation & you want to buy this model for yourself. I suggest you can check other phones within this price range if you're not a heavy user. If it is for your parents or for light work, then you can go for it.Camera quality is good except wide range lens. After captured image with wide angle it can distorted with a little zoom.Battery is more than enough as this phone is suitable for light work.

"

  Phone build quality: is good, it catches fingerprints very easily not a good quality material used.Camera: The camera is decent avg i can say on paper its 48mp but when the pic is zoom after clicking it gets blured tough.Screen: i'll give 9/10 for the screen all tough its very good and sharp but still i can see the colour shade appearing are not that bright.Battery: I'll give 4/10 rating because the battery performance which i expected is not upto the mark on paper it really looks attractive 6000mah but when you use it you will know it, only on lite usage without gaming and fully charged it only last 1day max 2hrs to next day and got screen usage only 5-6hrs which is bad for 6000mah it felt like using 4000mah battery.This battery quality could have been better for atleast at this price point of 16kOverall it is a good product its fast no lags or stutter i found

  M21 6gb Ram and 128 GB storage is more powerful in handling multiple task, and I gifted to my wife for her birthday. Since she was a teacher it was more useful in preparing power point presentation, video lessons using KineMaster and other apps like TEAMS, works smoothly. In shorter words it's like a mini computer.Camera quality is awesome, and good to see recording video in Slowmotion and Hyperlapse mode.SAR VALUE is very very low around 0.468, hence radiation is very less.Jio sim is working perfectly, call and signal quality is too good.

  Order on 4th July 2020, and received on 11th July 2020. The product was in good original condition without any transportation issues. Here are some pros and cons I experienced.Pros:1. Good and sturdy feel. Though not required, still got tempered glass and of course a rubberized back case.2. The big RAM (6 GB) is really handy since most of the time the system consumes about 50-60% of the memory i.e. about 3 GB or more. So, the system doesn't show any lag.3. Large storage of 128 GB is also quite useful in the long run. After update from my earlier mobile, i have about 35% storage consumed. Only about 70 GB is remaining out of about 112 GB that is available for use. I have not yet transferred the photos/video from older phone which would be about 25 GB. So, this 128 GB is very useful.4. Camera: I find it to take extremely good pictures. May not be of professional or even semi-professional level. Still good enough to capture moments in life in good quality pictures. The video quality with zoom and google meet for video conferencing, meetings and for giving lectures is much better than all the cameras (mobiles, laptop etc.) that we have. Even in low light, the picture/video quality is very good.Cons:1. The screen sometimes flickers. This problem had been pointed out by earlier buyers also.2. Occasionally, the systems seems to be a bit slow to screen touches. I have not yet fully optimized as per my requirements in the sense that stopping unwanted apps from getting loaded or keep running in the background. Still looking at the specification i.e. processor, memory, graphical processing unit (GPU)  and storage such lags is not expected.3. Ultra slow motion video: This could have been better. I am not able to capture ultra slow motion videos for more than a second or so. Either I couldn't find the proper settings or the mobile doesn't have.4. Battery: I haven't done a thorough testing about the batteries. This are only views based on observations for last 3 weeks. One of the primary reason to buy this product was its battery which is rated at 5800 mAh (and not really 6000 mAh as they advertise). However, the battery backup I didn't find it to be much less may be around 5000 mAh. My Honor 8 (2016 model) with 4000 mAh gives similar backup.Overall, I find this product to be worth buying and has rated 4 out of 5.

  Just go for it if you want Best Battery Backup and Best Display in this price range. Not that good for gamers. UI is clean and smooth. Just Love Samsung.❤️

  Samsung makes excellent phones with AMOLED screen that people love to use. The processor and touch response is buttery smooth. Everyday tasks are a breeze. The phone has all the bells and whistles including compass, FM radio, Dolby Atmos, low SAR etc and with the Always On Display (AOD) has superseded the “analogue” notification light.This phone is a super replacement for non trustworthy Chinese phones. Finally, the fingerprint sensor is lightning fast and its humongous battery is an added advantage. Camera performance and image quality is above par for the phone in this price range.

  If you often use mobile internet on a laptop/desktop via mobile hotspot, do not even think of considering this mobile phone since it doesn't support 5ghz bandwidth, in fact, most of the Samsung phones, even in the higher range such as s9 do not have 5ghz hotspot either. If you're using this phone as a mobile hotspot, I can guarantee that you'll be frustrated in the 1st 10 minutes.  Nothing about this phone is exceptional except for maybe it's battery. The camera & performance are below average, see comparisons on youtube with other phones of the same price range i.e note 9 pro. Now, I'm not advocating for Chinese products, but the NOTE 9 PRO, performs way better than this heavy piece of sheer nonsense. I bought this phone as an act of patriotism since I did not want to buy the Xiomi note 9 pro, as it's chinese product but I am truly disappointed by my decision. P.S Samsung provides the same 5ghz mobile hotspot service in their devices being sold in China & Korea. You can google each and everything that I said in this review to check the authenticity of the information. I highly recommend not buying this phone.

  My opinion on Samsung Galaxy M21 based on my previous 1 month of usage.I’m going to divide this review between pros and cons.PROS:-1. BATTERY: the battery life is unbelievable! On my usage it even went to day 3 without charging while I had always on display and mobile data turned on every time apart from general usage. I also used the hotspot to connect my mac. Still it went smoothly. Also, despite it’s huge 6000mAh battery phone doesn’t seem bulky.2. DISPLAY: the AMOLED panel is very bright, crisp and vibrant. The colour accuracy is also good. Samsung excels when it comes to display anyways.3. CAMERA: considering the price, the camera performance is above average. It takes some decent shots with good background blurring and colour accuracy. The selfie camera is also very good. It takes nice portraits.4. AUDIO: the output through audio jack is good. It has geed clarity and bass is balanced. Neither more nor less.5. HARDWARE: the Exynos 9611 processor handles day-to-day tasks smoothly without being heated up. Thanks to its 10nm processing. I’m not a gamer but I’ve see seen reviews where it handles games smoothly too. It is accompanied by 4gb DDR4 ram which is good and also UFS2.1 storage which makes the experience even smoother even though the price is so low.6. ONE-UI2.0: the experience is enhanced even more because of the UI. It is smooth, light weight, good looking yet simple and user friendly. Also there are tons of customizable options that helps every phone looks unique.7. NETWORK: there is good cellular reception and I never experienced any network issue whatsoever.CONS:-1. BUILT: thought it has low price but still built quality is not satisfactory. The plastic body in the back panel gets scratched easily. Also, it still has Gorilla glass 3 which seems to be out-dated now.2. SENSORS: the phone lacks compass and ambient light sensors. Though it manages to adjust brightness via front camera which it calls ‘adaptive brightness’ but a dedicated hardware is always a welcome feature.3. SPEAKERS: they are good. But can be better.At a price of 13999/- this phone is sure the best buy. It has AMOLED display which also comes with always on display which make it look pricier than it actually is. Also, this phone is not for hardcore gaming but then, none other phone in this segment can outperform it day-to-day usage. In the end I can say is it has a balanced specs where performance is concerned and adding the huge battery with a good display and oneUI2.0, it becomes the best buy at this price.

  I Purchased this phone it was replaced within  a week. So When i got the delivery 1st time, there was issue with the sound, There was just no sound in 3rd party apps, to which Amazon's Verification team visited checked and agreed to my point. They suggested me for replacement, to which i agreed. Second piece i received was literally cracked from the bottom. I have already seeked for refund but i am not sure i will get it or not. Camera was good, battery was good but this model has sound issues.

  Best mobile phone under this price range and battery life is too good almost 2 days with normal use and 1 day with any kind of rough or heavy use and only problem is it has 6000 mah battery but only supports 15w charging at least 30w would be good because for full charge from 0% to 100% it's taking 2:30hrs to 3:00hrs but it's not bothering me because my old phone was taking around same time with 3000mah so at the same time of charging i am getting double backup. And display is super amoled which is awesome and if you like too much edits in photos so this phone will give you so original and crisp and sharp photos but not as oppo vivo like over edited or cartoon like photos. And processor which is exynos 9611 is performing very good i have played pubg for atleast 2hrs but on HDR mode it was running very smooth and battery backup was awesome means for one game of atleast 30 minutes it was taking 7% of battery and don't play pubg like games for long time like more than 2hrs because it will heat little bit. One thing about battery i want to mention majorly that real power of 6000mah you will be able to see after 7 to 10days of use because new battery like this size requires 7 to 10days of charge discharge cycle to adjust itself. Honestly speaking i am writing this feedback at around 5:30pm and battery is on 72% and my mobile was fully charged at 8am in morning.And one of the best thing is that despite having 6000mah battery it's weight is only 188gm means by handling it you can't believe that 6000mah battery is inside.Please buy back cover and put a screen guard to protect it from scratches.

  The phone hot even in standby. You cannot use it even for nominal use.Amazon is just delaying the return. Yesterday asked for hard reset. Today they set a appointment with a technician which is 2 days away.Decent battery life. Average camera. Very good finger print reader. But unbearably hot while in use.Didn't want to write review for a phone which I have to return. But amazon and samsung making me do it

  I bought the Raven Black, 4GB-64GB variant of the Samsung and I must say I'm impressed with the phone's overall usability. I decided to go for Samsung by considering the brand value and overall specs of the phone. The main requirements for me were - Good display for media consumption, good battery life and a clean and easy to use UI without any unnecessary ads. Since the Galaxy M21 ticks all the right boxes I decided to go for this phone.-The display of the phone is brilliant and is at par with some of the high end phones.-The battery life is also very good and it easily gives 1.5 days backup even under heavy usage. The only complain I have is the length of the charging cable which is very short.- The performance is good too for day to day usage. - The Exynos 9511 is fairly capable and I haven't seen any stutter or lag in UI. If you are ahardcore gamer than I would recommend to look for alternative since it would not perform as good as its competition in regards to gaming. For casual gamers it will do the job well.-The cameras on this phone are brilliant with very good image processing done by Samsung. It takes pictures with natural colours.- The speaker output is average. Its loud enough but the sound produced is nothing impressive since it lacks bass and that clarity in the sound output.- The audio output via the 3.5mm Jack is very good as it supports Dolby Atmos.- The fingerprint sensor is very fast but the face unlock feature is not that consistent as it sometimes fails to read your face.Hence, overall it is a great value package from Samsung and I would highly recommend this phone to everyone looking for a good phone at this price point unless he/she is a heavy gamer. Thanks for reading.The packaging could have been better, there was no bubble wrapping or air pockets around the box for protection against bumps or drops during transit and the packaging was only the Amazon's plastic cover(with a layer of bubble wrapping) which I believe isn't recommend for transportation a smartphone.

  they should have used another proccessor because even though they give 6000mah battery . it also depends on the processor how efficiently the power utilizes as it is an outdated proccessor it dosen't optimize 6000mah compared to other snapdragon proccessor so, i suggest don't fool out with 6000mah because if you compare poco f1 with snapdragon 845 vs this phone both shows same performace in power wise because in poco f1 it optimizes power well compared to this phone. so, 6000mah is for namsake without a good proccessor. so, if anyone wants to take any phone first see its proccessor and then specifications always proccessor must be the first priority

  Worest mobile  don't  buy  it go to another brandEvery slow running  process, application's force closes. Even fingerprint also very slow unlock  some times not working.

"

  1. Battery life meeting expectations,  but heating while charging.2. fingerprint sensors bit slow and autoexide number of attempt without touching finger if I am carrying in pants pocket , in short it tries to detect any skin even in pocket.3. Camera is perfect, exiding expectations,  het don't knw how to utilize them efficiently 😅.4. Back of the phone gets scratches immediately, you should buy a back cover to its shiny look away from the world , even you cant see it bcz it will be covered with back cover, I think back shine is only for advertisements,  not remaining for show off.😄5. Front glass is awesome and scratch less, haven't used temperature glass or scratch guard yet.Feels like premium phone.

  This phone is absolutely #monster● it has got a 6000 MAH battery which lasts more than one day even after heavy (I attend more than 4 hours of video conference)● both the selfie and the rear cameras work perfectly fine but there is a big drop in lowlight but I believe that a small software update would fix it● everyone knows about the Exynos 9611 processor so I want talk about it● it has 6.4 inches big super amoled display which is absolutely absolutely perfect in this price range and everyone also knows about how Super AMOLED displays are so I won't talk about it● it has a very clean UI which is one UI and I just love it at the start it has some blot wear but I removed it easily□ one thing I would like to say that when you are setting up the device please read every details very carefully● I am in love with this monster, I would recommend you if you are a student and searching for a good mobile under 15k● this device will never let you downThanks for reading....... hope this helps you

  Before writing the review I want to tell you that I am not a promoter of samsung phones and to be honest I didn't liked the J series at all. But when it comes to this model, samsung has changed each and every bit of it and made this phone a completely different one. I used to watch the reviews of this model and they told that even though the overall performance is good, it is not up to the mark when it comes to gaming. But believe me this one works really well for pubg and there are no problems yet (4GB 64GB). The user interface is absolutely gorgeous. And the SAMOLED screen gives you a tremendous picture quality. The only thing that I am not satisfied about is the 6000 mah battery. I think it is a made up figure. It actually does the same that a 5000 mah can provide. But in overall after using it for last 3 months I can assure you that it is worth for the money. I got it for 12699 which gives me extra satisfaction.

  Samsung is globally no1 seller of the smartphone plz by this phone as super amoled display and 6000 mah in this price range

  This product is defective and display is not working in just 3 days and now I have requested 3 times for return and refund but phone is not picked up. Amazon pick up man is refusing for pick up . The return pickup was scheduled on 24th July but no body came for pick up . When I called pick up agent, he said that your pick was cancelled . When I called up amzon customer service , the customer service person told me that while 1st time return pick on 22nd July , the pick up person mentioned comment “ IMIE no mismatch” and he did not pick up . In fact how he can see IMIE no when phone display is not working. This is very bad service and system on Amazon . I am surprised with this kind of pathetic service from Amazon.

  The Camera Quality is excellent . Looks too Cute  especially the curved edges1: With 6000 mAh battery, standby time is supperb,2: Most attractive factor of this phone is display. It is an excellent one3 also the Videos with different resolutions shows the real live look.4;Phone's performance is good for a normal user. For a normal user Samsung Exynos 9611 processor is enough.5:Gorilla Glass protection backside n front side Gorilla Glass 3 Protection for Display. Better Front Camera 20mp N6: Real Thunder in Battery Side . Huge supply of power , No need to carry power bank anymore. built quality is wonderfulI Will recommend the product who are looking for mobiles phones under 15K

  The phone is a complete package in the price range, I bought the 4gb variant for 12699, since I feel it's better to buy31 rather than going for m21 6gb variant. It's just, 4gb one is better budget oriented.Anyway, will talk about some good points and bad points, since I have used this phone for almost 5 days.So let's get started:-one of the best thing about this phone which might attract the regular Chinese phone buyers towards its is the display. And yeah I can say it's worth it.-camera is nice for the price range I would say, i.e under 13000, but I don't feel under 15000 it's that good. Since u can get other phone with better camera quality.-now coming to the processor...it's bad! But not that bad...it will provide good overall experience, but gaming, it's not made for it.So overall it's a nice phone, and plus I haven't seen any charging issue as well..It gets fully charged around 160mins as claimed by the co.So my final verdict would be if u want a Samsung phone under budget and are not inclined towards gaming that much((don't get me wrong, u can play games, but there are better phones out for that, for maybe even cheaper)), go for it..But again I would recommend u to go for the 4gb variant or if u want 6gb then go for m31...m21 6gb one is not just worth IMO

  I bought the Raven Black, 4GB-64GB variant of the Samsung Galaxy M21 for my mother. I'm impressed with the phone's overall usability. Since my mother is not a heavy user unlike me, I decided to go for Samsung by considering the brand value and overall specs of the phone. The main requirements for my mom are- Good display for media consumption, good battery life and a clean and easy to use UI without any unnecessary ads. Since the Galaxy M21 ticks all the right boxes I decided to go for this phone. Moreover my mother was using a Samsung Mobile prior to this and hence she was accustomed with the functionality of the UI.-The display of the phone is brilliant and at par with the Amoled display of my Redmi K20 Pro.-The battery life is also very good and it easily gives 1.5 days backup even under heavy usage. The only complain I have is the length of the charging cable which is very short.- The performance is good too for day to day usage. The Exynos 9511 is fairly capable and I haven't seen any stutter or lag in UI. If you are ahardcore gamer than I would recommend to look for alternative since it would not perform as good as its competition in regards to gaming. For casual gamers it will do the job well.-The cameras on this phone are brilliant with very good image processing done by Samsung. It takes pictures with natural colours.- The speaker output is average. Its loud enough but the sound produced is nothing impressive since it lacks bass and that clarity in the sound output.- The audio output via the 3.5mm Jack is very good as it supports Dolby Atmos.- The fingerprint sensor is very fast but the face unlock feature is not that consistent as it sometimes fails to read your face.

  One of the main reason for buying this phone was the higher capacity battery and fast charging, but it failed to deliver on the expectation. The so called fast charging takes almost  3.5 hrs to charge from 5 to 100 percent and top of that with normal usage battery doesnt last for 2 days. The auto adjustment of screen brightness is poor, and found it too bright often and have to reduce manually. Camera quality is good. Sound quality of speaker is poor for both ringer as well songs etc. As a samsung product expected it to be better then what was delivered. They have put a lot of hardware but should work on building a system software which utilizes the hardware efficiently. The RAM consumption until now was always excess of 4 gb always, going upto 5 gb with almost minimum apps running in the background. Thanks to system upgrade installed in July end it is now below 4gb for the first time, hopefully they work further on it to enhance the obvious issues and tune up the system overall soon.

  I brought this as a gift for my brother. This is a great phone for the price! The exchange service was hassle-free, and gave me a great deal on the old phone. I had brought the M20 last year, and this year's M21 has a lot of upgrades & there is a big difference between the two models. The screen is a crisp sAMOLED, which has a great viewing quality, the battery is bigger & lasts longer, and the camera quality is much, much better than the previous model. The phone works great! Thank you Amazon and the seller!

"
"

  128 gigs of storage and 6 GB RAM for 15,999 is a pretty good deal. Camera is amazing. Android 10 UI is nice and clean to use.Battery life is good, but for 6000 mAh one expects longer performance. It's good, but a full charge takes almost 3 hours. That and the preinstalled ad-apps (easily circumventable but annoying) are the only downsides.

"

  I like this phone very much.It has huge battery that last whole day easily under heavy usage. But note that charging fully takes easily around 3.5 hours which is not problem overnight.Phone is quick in reaction and I'm really sensitive about reaction speeds... So I'm happy. Rarely during browsing it lags but I think it is due to browser error and conectivity. On paper some competitors have faster cpu, but in practice I doubt there is much difference... Unless you do games...Speaker sound is ok, though not great.Microphone sound is ok according to callee.Camera is ok, although I'm not a photographer...Usb port works as otg (I can connect my usb flash drive through cable reduction and it works fine).OLED dispaly is super nice, I much prefer over LCD.What is really plus is this phone has antenna bands suitable for both india and europe. Chinease competitors like redmi does not have both bands in one phone.What is minus is there is no NFC.Also rounded dispaly is terrible for fitting any screen protector. If you are super good you have just small reduction on sides after installing screen protector :( You can used to it, but I'm pissed that samsung does such shitty impractical display design...Also for using there is one potential unpleasant thing - samsung has no protection to activate phone in your pocket. There is proximity sensor but it is ignored. If you have phone in your pocket and by mistake touch fingerprints sensor it can be unlocled and anything could be pressed in your pocket...Anyway over all best value phone. And I'm happy to own this one...

  After handling this monster for 15 days I'm writing this review.Build quality: Overall a good build quality except at back.User interface: awsome user friendly interface providing an access to every tool, simplified notification panel, dark mode, always on display and much more.Display: a superb viewing experience on a super amoled no doubts.Battery: it's a monster but drains fast and fast charge works average. Providing an usage of one and half day for semi heavy user.Camera: the back camera setup is good but it could be better if optimization is of that level. Front camera is as good as expected it satisfies your needs.Performance: for an average user there is no complaints at all but for an heavy user it may sometimes lags.As a whole its a monster at affordable price rangeGo for it.

  It's been almost one month I am using this phone. I have noticed some great features on this phone also there are some drawbacks.- Battery Life is amazing. Lasts 1.5 days for me.- Camera quality is good, but some adjustments needed. 48 MP shooter takes a little time to save the files. Colours are good, the selfie camera is good.- Great Display. Clear and bright.- Fingerprint sensor is fast but sometimes it's not accurate.- Speakers are good, no problem during calls.- Charger takes more than 2 hours to go 100% from below 5%.- Processor is good, no heating during gaming. (I don't play games on regular basis)In the end, I will say if you are a normal user you can surely go for this. This phone is value for money.

  Writing review after 8 hours of opening phone.Getting unbearably hot when on the call within 3min on call and after 15-20 min usage, making it impossible to be kept near ear. Fingerprint is hit or miss. Charging time from 2-91% is 3hrs, who knows how long more it will take. Heating like furnace while charging, one may burn hand from it.Have logged a complaint for replacement. Executive from Amazon tech support asked me to download Balcanno app for troubleshooting. Strangely while the phone was extremely hot the app showing temp. of battery just 32 degree C. and its acceptable range is 48 degrees. An absolutely incorrect results.Who in this world will accept temp range of 48degrees for something which is to be kept near ear..Technician visit schedule for tomorrow, but I request for urgent replacement of device. This is not a delightful experience. I hope Amazon will help me. Keeping my fingers crossed.

"
"

  Battery standby is outstanding. You don't need to charge for next 19-20 hours after 100% charge. But it takes 2.5 -3 hours for fully charge. Obviously it's slow but not that slow. Upto 60-70 % get charge rapidly. This is not for PUBG Lovers but still you can play in HDR settings. Guys who watch movies, netflix & other OTT contents seriously this phone is for you. Watch it for 9-10 hours no problem.

"

  Value for money. I am not a gamer So can't say about the gaming performance. But for those who are buying it for normal usage, this phone is great.Brilliant camera, huge battery life and excellent amoled display in addition with the premium feeling of samsung.

"

  Battery backup is not as expected from 6000 Mah. Also charging  is very slow, taking almost 6 hours to full charged ( without  any use ). Also heating problem during  phone call and charging.Indoor network is very poor as compared to my another mobile phone with same service provider.I am very disappointed with this product from Samsung. Not acceptable..Please return your product and refund me. So that I can buy a different mobile.

  Nice mobile at mid range price with lot of new features.Best features -Inbuilt VPNEnhanced securityGreat displayHuge battery with fast charging supportGreat Camara with slow motion and hyperplase .Automatic DNSDolby atmosApp usage time managerFocus modeAnd much more....Loved it.Cons- 1.minor heating issue while long working and during charging2.Charging takes little bit more time( may be due to the watt capacity of charger)3. Less frequently hang or close the app.4. Night mode is not much effective.5. Ad during charging on lock screen.6. Finger scan is little bit slower.New update has brought more new feature in it.

"

  The phone is just superb. The battery is awesome. It can last upto 1.5 days after full charge. The camera quality is also great. Depth effect is fantastic. The front camera is also very good. The performance of this phone is awesome. But there are two things that are the cons of this phone. First one is that the phone automatically restarts sometimes. And the second thing is that is finger print sensor is not upto the mark. Sometimes it cannot read the fingerprint. Apart from these two the phone is brilliant.

  Camera performance really pathetic. Could have been improved. Divices of this budget giving better camera quality. Especially selfie camera is pathetic. Video also in slo-motion keep flicking in night or in low light. I hv vivo v9 pro which is performing dam good in low light n night also if compare to m21. Super slo-motion records for 4 sec video only which is not understood. Disappointed with the purchase. Sumsung pl understand the market without good camera it is difficult to survive in the market. My personal advice ti samsung. Thanks

  Ordered this on 12th August and got this on 22nd... It's a long time... One of my friend ordered on 16th Midnight and got the phone on 17th...The next thing is there was no invoice in the packet...Then the battery is draining out like hell and because of that I can't touch the mobile...5mintues watching of YouTube video taking away 5% charge... Have to give charge for 3 times in last 24 hours...Next the handset is getting toooooooooooooo warm when charging or doing something with the mobile like data transferring or watching YouTube or scrolling fb....Camera quality doesn't seem good to me...Viideo quality is very very bad....But 2of my friends are using same mobile,,,there everything is very good... No problem in there sets...So the conclusion is I GOT A DAMAGED PRODUCT AFTER WAITING FOR EVERYBODY 10 DAYS...My 3years old mobile works and serves better than the Product,,which is delivered to me....

So order backcover and tempered glass when you placing order as its backbody is plastic amd more prone to scratches..10.Loud speaker 1.5/5Loudspeaker sound level is very low.. (Keep earphones)Verdict: For this price Its the best choice if you are not a hardcore gamer ...

  Writing it after using this phone for a week. Considering the price i did not have much hope, but still it was able to disappoint me. This was my second Samsung phone after 7 years,My experience:-1. 6000 mah battery is for the name sake. With normal internet usage and watching couple of clips it goes to 50%.2. The Camera is an utter disappointment. Its not that i was hoping it to be like a high end phone. But its really bad. They hv put lots of features in it and all are below average. Also, it is slow. It takes a considerable number of clicks to flip from front to back camera and vice versa.3. The RAM is of 4 GB which should be good for a new phone running apps one by one, but it flickers and sometimes crashes.My suggestion?:- Please skip it if you can. If you want to buy it for older family members who are just into calling, go for cheaper one than this. At least you would save some money.

  I use a single phone, with high usage of data transmission and data storage, and I also travel a fair deal. So my review may be more relevant for similar users.1. The phone battery goes on and on. Nearly never empties, except when I did not charge for 2 days. Normally, at night it is around 50% and I charge it back to 100%. This is really useful for travel in future, even if currently travel is restricted due to covid.2.  The camera does very competent job of still and videos. I am not a photo expert, so cannot comment on technical complexities there.3. I chose 128GB storage and 6GB RAM. While 64GB / 4GB would have been enough, regular upgrades of Android over next 2-3 years of this phones expected life may need more memory and having more storage also helps in keeping multiple email accounts and also music, pictures, ebooks etc,, without having to worry about phone slowing down due to lack of free space.4. THe display is very sharp and i have not found any difficulty in using it during day or night.5. Response time: The phone is very responsive, far more than the M30 which I used earlier. It has never kept me waiting.6. Connectivity seems very good - have not faced difficulty in wifi, bluetooth connects and also using as hotspot.7. I have two  - 4G SIM cards from different operators - and both work in 4G mode. Older phones allowed only one of the SIMs to work in 4G mode.Suggestion:1. Would like facility to have two users accounts defined under Android. This facility is available under Android but blocked by Samsung in this model.

  Writing after one month of use.1.Display is good2. Battery backup is good for regular use of mobile. Battery lasts for 30-32 hours without playing games.3.Takes too much time to recharge the battery, about two and half hour.4.fingerprit reader works quickly but sometimes doesn't work.5.camera quality is good.6.Sound quality is Ok of mobile speaker..very Poor with headphones even with Sony headphones.7.Hangs sometimes.(samsung's😃 speciality)*Overall:-Not for online gamersNot for music loversNot for heavy usersGood for regular usersGood for videos and movie lovers.Good for photography lovers.

  I just bought this phone after comparing it with several other phone within the same price range but the 6000 mAh battery, stock android, screen resolution and camera quality left me with no other choice. It is best phone in 10k-15k range and it is really worth to spend 14000 for this device although it listed on Flipkart for 14500 price. Amazon delivered it on time even in this pandemic. Thank you Samsung & Amazon !!!!

  Thanks for Amazon and STPL exclusive online for delivering the product within 9 hrs from order, it's  flash delivery. Packaging was good.Just open up the box, have few recommendation before getting in phone, where Samsung has to improve.1. Expected a Mobile case inbuilt which was missing.2. Warranty card, sorry paper is available. Hope we can claim using invoice with samsung.3. Charger cable was too short, mere 60 cm - shocker to me with such small cable.4. Big bulky charger with 15w fast charging.5. Too many bloatwares by Samsung, moment connected wifi configured downloading many apps. Need to uninstall one by one.6. Plastic back panel, makes mobile alike cheaper product, ahead of good configuration.7. Display is good and 4k wallpapers are so crystal clear along few videos in youtube.8. Approx 24~ gb occupied by default configuration. 102gb user able to use.9. 4k videos playing from youtube are great and treat to watch.10. Neat and elegant design in width, compact in hand with 7.5cm width, which was alligned like 1+ 7t11. No option to resize icons by default system configuration. Very average icon style, rather poor I can say.12. No earphones with kit. Not even basic.13. Smart switch helped to transfer apps and media/files. Missed to transfer system settings.We have to wait and watch to justify if the mobile meets expectations.

  Hello everyoneYou can fully trust on this reviewIts my experience have been using this phone for 2 monthsI hav bought this phone 2 months agoAnd i think now i should review thisI'm not technical personBut i will say my experience with this phoneCamera quality, battery, look everything is good average not excellent but ok..I dnt have complaint of themBut worst thing is soundVery very slowYou cant heard voice during callYou have yo press phone yo your ears yo here voiceSame thing is with media sound.Very slowI hate this thing abt this phoneI'm not satisfied with this purchaseI  suggest everyone to not buy this phone

"

  It is value for money product for me. The best part is it's screen which is too good. The camera and performance is also good. Maybe the Chinese phones have a better processor or ram at this price but I don't mind paying a slight more for a non-chinese phone.Would always prefer to buy Samsung phones for their quality. Hope Samsung bring such budget phones with competitive specifications and pricing.

  Fingerprint is very fast,Camera also good ,i like steady mode... Two days battery backup with daily use....Over all awesome build in quality with advanced features and high performance ...

  Neil Armstrong, ""That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.""i don't take much time, directly review about my Raven Black M21(6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)...Pros:1) the 6000 mah battery totally scam. At first day of receive,it charge upto 83% only in 6 hours and not exceeding(which gave me hard shock). And now after using a week it charge 100% in 2 hours(yes,please read again).Thanks to C type charge. You have to give time to your phone set with charger at initial stage, after that it will surprise you. Even in night phone consumes only 1% and from 100% to 5% it takes 3.5 days to degrade.2) other reviewers(on this or other site) say that M21 is only for non gamer, but i say use it as I install NFS no limit, WGT golf etc. big game and it work completely fine. All thanks to its upgraded android system, best processor and chipset.3) Best quality triple camera with limited best option like Panorama, pro,food,night,slomo, hyperlapse etc.,which i personally like as it will not lag my system configuration.4) Best in era, in todays corona budgetary world with money saving.5) i surely say samsung strong step towards AI tech in medium range phones will help people to upgrade themselves.Cons:1) i concerned about long last life of plastic back cover given, as ""samsung family"" of my house all members uses samsung phones which lasted at least 6 years and still in working condition.2) cons or not, but this time samsung does not give Earphones. Which i like the most compare to other brands. And also omit sample cover for phone.About first line,in my words,""That's one small step for samsung, one giant leap of mankind to AI.""

  am writing my review after using it for 6 days.I have bought sumsung phone after 7 years hoping it could be good phone but samsung again disappointed me a lot.They claim it has 6000mAH battery but drain like 3000mAH and it take almost 2.30hrs to charge from 10% to 90% so its fast charging is not a fast charging. Its just a market gimic to clail it monester like features i.e.battery 6000mAH ,15W fast charge ete but reality is far far away from claims.Others features are as per price range but if you thinking for a battery packed phone with fast charge,then I would sugget plz search for others phone in same range.

  Good specs... But... literally below average camera... forget low light capturing of any kind and gcam...no knox, applock, good lock, you can't even turn off torch with power button...!!!! What kind of os tunning is that, that too after I have heard a lot about One OS...!!! Oh SAMSUNG! Furthermore, brightness is an issue in direct sunlight, and also in dark room... speaker sound is also an issue.. AND LAST BUT NOT THE LEAST, Network has a grave issue...!!! This phone is like a room with AC, Fridge, large LED Tv, but has a leakage in the roof...!!! Aghust.... Now on 12.07.2020- Amazon is showing its main 48mp camera as a f1.8 camera. But that is wrong. Its main camera is f2.0 aperture. Anyone can check it on Samsung website or anywhere else wherever they can. I don't know why Amazon are misleading.... The question goes to Amazon too... why???

  This is a ausome phone under 15k but i will not revomend this device for gaming as it heqts in just 5 to 20 min .. and also the battery is not good at all .. rather it is 6000 mah but but exhausts from 100% to 30% in just  5 hours during online class which is not a heavey usage ... so it is ausome but if u are in good battery  i will suggeat to buy redmj note 9 pro and if u are in gaming then i woild suggest to buy realme 6 or Samsung a50s .. also i face some statures and lahs also sometime .. The screen is not so flient but the vamera is very nice ...

  I bought this phone with great expectation and I must say it does stand up to its claim, the display is good, speakers are fine, camera is cool and the phone isn't that heavy though it has a 6000maH battery. HOWEVER I am a bit skeptical of the battery. It offers a monster battery and despite not being a a heavy nor even a moderate gamer, my battery life doesn't look promising. with the medium power saver mode on, I'm just managing to make it function for around 24 hours. Which would include maximum 3 hours of Netflix/Prime. I don't know if it's the best the phone offers, but since the highlight factor of the phone was the battery, i must say it isn't upto my expectation, despite not playing any PubG or other games.

"

  Too much heating issue, It overheats when you use it, It also overheats anytime randomly even if it is in your pocket.I had to visit Samsung service center, 1 hour after receiving the device. Service center refused to help because I purchased the mobile from Amazon. Amazon refused to return product, Instead they sent replacement after inspection. This is the first time I am feeling sorry to shop from Amazon. 6000mAh battery doesn't last for single day with no gaming, no video streaming and very modest use.The battery drains because of heating. Once used navigation in my Car and had to switch it off after 30 minutes due to over heating....its a safety risk.Tomorrow, I will get replacement mobile and sell it to a shop on Rs2000 less. Will buy other mobile from that shop.I wouldn't recommend this product. I wanted to buy a non China phone but looks like Samsung trying to ride on anti China sentiments and make profits, compromising on quality and safety.Worst thing....Amazon now does not protect interests of its customers. Will never buy Mobiles, tablets or laptops from Amazon08/10/2020: Amazon agreed to return and refund

  STPL has been sending defective phones this is my 3rd phone from same vendor. Amazon is doing nothing and now that I've crossed 10 days i can't return. Phone calls are not going through and some times gets disconnected. I've done all factory reset and tried new sim. Damn I feel ashamed of purchased this from amazon that too from same vendor. I didn't have option to choose another vendor. Amazon has deserted me lifted up its hands

  Before I go into details, let me admit that I was a staunch ""hater"" of Samsung Android phones, specially in the low mid range. The first and last Samsung phone I used was a Galaxy Core, back in 2012. I absolutely hated it, and promised to never buy a Samsung phone ever. But then there was an ad and I purchased this M21.. Samsung again, after 8 years. And during these 8 years, I have used Sony Xperia, Moto G, Redmi 4, Redmi Note 7 Pro. So my review is actually a comparison of those phones with this beast.The major advantage of this phone, compared to my Moto G, is the brilliant sAmoled display with Full HD resolution (not 720p, thank God).Processor is so optimised for this phone that it works like a breeze and stays cool like, unlike my both Redmi's. I dont bother the fact that its not a Snapdragon. Performance and usability is so much optimised that you shall never complain.Battery backup is a perfect two day affair, for more than normal usage. Screen on time is excellent. I can easily go through 2 days even after streaming web series and talking a lot on phone calls.The only thing that bothered me is the finger print sensor. Its not a feather touch one, definitely. But it still works pretty good, once you put your finger on inlt properly.For me, its a very good deal under 15k. Would recommend this to anyone, even when blind folded!

  Was a Nokia fan, Post their debacle moved on as Motorola fan, for last 5 years. Did take s chance to buy a Galaxy M10s last year, for my family. Post the experience  on that, I just bought this Galaxy M21 few weeks back. It was delivered in this Covid situation and was on time. Am actually liking all the features installed. Camera is too cool, long battery hours, great features....having great time.

  So I have got this phone yesterday onlyAnd on basis of one day observation, I am giving the following review1.Camera-3.8 🌟both front and rear click good pictures2. Battery-4 🌟 because battery is great but a little less standby, according to 6000mahI will rather say it to be a 5500 mAh battery3.Chargin- So the phone and the charger, both heats up while chargingI know it is very obvious but still expected better4. Fingerprint sensor-5 🌟 Very fast5.Face sensor: works good but requires 30%of brightness to work5. Processor(#pubg)- 4 🌟 Processor is strong enough and pubg runs good on hd and ultra but not too strong for extensive gamingFor lite players, it is 4/56. Display. 5 🌟7. Connectivity. 2 🌟 *Now this is a problem, I used jio sim and the download speed from play store was too slow and when I used the same SIM on realme c2, it worked quite fastProblems- connectivity and heating while charging

"
"

  Pros :- Huge Battery- Super Awesome Display- Excellent Cameras- Excellent Build Quality- Good Processor- No Heating problem- Able to play all Games like PUBG and COD- Dedicated SD Card Slot- Light weight- 15 W Super Charger, Once charge huge battery gives 2 days backup.Cons :- No Headsets in the Box- No Protective case in the Box- Plastic Back bodySuper Happy by purchasing Non china mobiles

"

  Atleast you should have given basic screen guard and transparent phone cover. Now Samsung has even stopped giving earphones along with their phones. Adapter is so slow that it takes  atleast 6 hours to get charged, plus battery back up is not as per expectation. And charging your phone in 8 hrs really sucks. And the only thing they took money for is 6gb ram, 128 gb internal. Please don't buy this product. It is a complete burden

"
"

  1st time, ordered a mobile on amazon n got damaged handset..replacement process is very tedious in case of mobiles..there is no system of quality check in amazon I suppose. the packaging was very good but the mobile was defective..they think people are fools to shell out so much money and buy damaged items..hv ordered all the mobiles of our family members thru Flipcart but never faced this problem..just a week ago, had bought samsung galaxy A51 thru flipcart and it works perfectly fine..the worst part is, it was n exchange offer..they hv take away the old mobile n don't hv any mobile nw

"
"

  1.Poor finger print,taking long time to unlock,2.Charging is slow,though it is saying fast charging3.Low user interface than other products run on android4.Battery backup is not up to the mark,6000 mah is for marketing purpose infact I also purchased  this for battery ......but ...5.processor okay6. Too much brightness  even in auto condition, should improve in this department7.Sound is less in loud speaker  mode

"
"

  Battery: Takes more than 2 Hr to charge fully due to huge battery capacity. Once fully charged, lasts for more than 24 Hr even after 6 hr of extensive use.Camera: Day light pics are awesome but pixels get distorted when image is zoomed even if it's set to 48 megapixel. Image size is huge if 48 megapixel setting is used. In dark room image and selfie are sufficently good with flash. Different aspect ratios available in setting to cover desired witdh and range.Display: Butturly smooth touch. Clarity of content is awesome. Blue light filter option with option to manage opacity is available in quick drop down menu.Sound: DecentUSB wire lenght: 0.5 MTR only. Too small.Pre-installed apps.: Amazon, Netflix, Microsoft  office, different apps of Samsung including samsung store etc. And some Chines apps. It's better to uninstall useless apps on very first day.SIM: Both sim slot support simultaneous LTE facility.Ear phone slot provided at bottom beside charging port.Weight: Light as compared to size.Dual Masaanger facility allow us to active two what's app account simultaneously.No earphone provided.Conclusion: In such a price, lots of good feature provided by this Made in India phone. For regular use, this phone can be choosen.

  I have been a long term Xperia, HTC and Moto user. Consider that this review is from a non Samsung guy who doesn't want to buy a non branded smartphone.Pros :1. Excellent display - The best I have used in the last few years.2. Good battery - Non gaming person will end his day easily with 20% charge still left.3. UI - Could have been more cleaner but bloatware can either be uninstalled or disabled.4. System - Has call recording and various customization features by default which my earlier phones lacked.5. Camera - Could rate it 3.5 out of 5. Takes good photos but lacks 60fps video recording.  So camera rating is not a pro not a con.Cons :1. Design - Plastic body, non premium look, slippery design, fingerprint magnet.2. Charging - Takes 3 hours to charge from 0 to 100%.3. Fingerprint - I feel the positioning of fingerprint sensor is not at the correct place.4. Sensor - It uses front camera as light sensor for auto brightness, hence drains lot of battery until adaptive brightness is turned off.

  If you are looking foa phone for day to day use, this is the phone for you.Battery life is awesome.Amoled display so no compromise there. 1080 videos can be watched on youtube.Biometric sensor is bit slow just like face recognition, but not that slow.Camera is good for outdoors. Slowmo flickers when taken indoor.Overall phone is the best you can get at this price or even under 20k range. (Unless you want to go for chinese brands)Edit : After 1 week of use I experienced a lag in notification panel while using camera.PS : don't completely drains your phones battery charge it when you can.

  Not Happy with Amazon for this purchase.Faulty product delivered.Just after one month, Screen is on but not responding at all. Samsung service centre has told it is showing water damage!There were no water damage chances at my place for last one month, and I am pretty sure this damage is more older.Actually the water damage is even before the ordering thru Amazon, this handset already had water in it.I know that company will not take responsibility now and that is the reason I am surely going to report this fraud to everyone.Samsung is still a Fraud !Hope that Amazon helps here!

"
"

  After three months of extensive usage, I am quite satisfied with the overall performance of this phone. Both the front and back cameras click crystal-clear pictures. The AMOLED display is good, and the battery backup is quite efficient.But the only negative point that needs to be brought to notice of the company is a minor heating issue. Whenever I open the camera, the upper portion of the phone heats up quickly, making it seem quite dangerous.To sum it up, this is a good phone in this budget that anyone can choose to buy.

"
"

  Glad that samsung launched the best phone under 15k segment. Contains no annoying, and vulgar ads as present in chinese company phones. Data privacy and safety by samsung gives a lot of confidence. Can't rely on chinese companies regarding data safety, as recently my youtube channel got hacked.-> Coming to features,The display is the best.Camera quality is amazing, except the focus problem while recording video.Battery is beastly.Didn't try heavy gaming.It's been a month and so far for my usage 5/5.** Posted images with focus shifting between samosa and remote. Check it out.

  Phone  m21 6Gb delivered on 17 June, it was good suddently from 13 July the phone charging slot started heating up.Now the phone is not charging at all. It only charges when connected to laptop or PC but some thing starts melting.Some thing have been burnt inside.And the Faulty replace is just for 10 Day form Purchase.Samsung India is answerable for this, this shows the level of QA is done by Samsung IndiaRecommendation : Do not purchase this phone. This is second faulty product in last 7 years. I wasted my money investing on it.

  REVIEW AFTER USAGE OF 2 MONTHS.Varient: 128gbCamera: The back camera clicks great photos even in low light. The colour and depth of photos perfect. The front camera is also better than average.Battery: The time taken to charge is about 2 and half hours( because its a large battery 6000 mah). With average usage (i.e without gaming), it lasts almost 1 day 20 hours. I used the phone for watching videos and accessing tutorial.Fingerprint: Its quick and accurate. Before this i used a MI handset. The fingerprint sensor is better than previous one.Heating problem: Its gets heated with heavy usage. Pretty normal with average budget phones,i guess.Processor: The phone is fast and works smoothly. Switches like a butter between multiple applications.Look and feel: It fits great on the hand. Looks decent. It has a good grip, doesn't slip from hand.Its the best choice under 15k. I'm really happy with my handset. Samsung doesn't disappoint.

"
"

  Writing this after one month of use. Overall handset is claiming to have all the features for a budget phone. But I'm not so satisfied with its performance. Camera images quality is not so ""wow"". Worst problem I'm facing with network connectivity, regular network and mobile data. Issues like no network, voice breaking, call drops, delay in connecting call. I'm not getting signals at any places inside my house which was not so problematic with my previous phone redmi note 5 pro. Battery is good, since it is new phone.

"
"

  Box contents-Device, user manuals, sim card ejector needle, adapter and charging cable.The cable is bit small. Could have been longer.First impression-Felt it slightly heavier than its siblings probably because of huge battery. It's worth it, considering the battery performance.Display-New shiny blue body toy with huge full screen display and water drop notch. Looks fabulous. Amazing crisp clear display with punchy colors(although the colors are bit too punchy sometimes, especially primary colors) and built in dark mode and blue light filter (to be swited on manually)Display is pretty snappy, refresh rate is pretty fast in this segment.Camera-Triple cam with 48mp, wide angle works better than Samsung M30. Camera module is main attraction of the phone. Looks neat.Finger print reader is quite fast, and opens up in milliseconds.Overall it's amazing package for the budget definately recommended.Samsung is giving tough competition to chinese brands.

"
"

  its camera is so hezzy and poor quality camera ever seen in my life,no other adapter or cable or dual pen drive fit to this model except it's charging cable data is not transfarable. charging spped is so slow. fake product given by advertisement. plz do not buy this product if you do not want to suffer like me.I am requested to amazone plz expose my review only good rating reviews are shown below the review list for their best selling.pen drive  otg another charger not support .customer support bad amazon....bad phone cheated each and every people.

  If you want a non Chinese mid range phone under 15k Go for it :)A good quality mid range phone for 15k (6gb,128gb) If you got any old phone in working condition to exchange then it will be helpful. I exchanged a old Redmi 5A and final offer price I got was 13k which is a great deal.The phone is from a South Korean based company and it gives amazing battery life with that 6000mah capacity. Excellent full HD superAMOLED screen panel. Triple sim slot. Option for choosing 2g, 3g, 4g network separately. Decent camera performance and smooth Samsung OneUI. The processor is not that amazing but the same Exynos 9611 is used from phones ranging 13k to 25k models by Samsung so its a good choice for M21. I will say M21 is better than M30s which is 2k more than M21 but both are same to same in all aspects.

"
"

  I will comment on this phone after 10 days of usage .....let us talk about it point wise...1) Display: Just flawless.....the crisp and contrast in the colours......if u wannna binge webseries and movies....Just go for it!2) Fingerprint: it's NOT SUPER FAST but it's REALLY QUICK......3) Performance: Awesome....not such lag observed .....okaay I am not a gamer....played pubg for abt 1 hr at a stretch......in HD and HIGH...it was infact the recommended graphics by default...No such lag and smooth performance....4) Camera: the back camera is decent.....but the front camera struggles to capture details....I must say if u apply the filters given to u by Samsung...IT IMPROVES THE DETAILS and gives u comparatively better pics than ORIGINAL mode......Hope Samsung fixes it through software update..5) Battery: DECENT but not EXCELLENT...u will get backup somewhat more than 5000mah.6)Value for money: it is value for money!!!!!!😉U can go for it!!

"
"

  The phone is good if you get it in a deal. Its camera is quite good , clicks great daytime images and good nighttime pics.Camera processing speed Is a bit slow. Display is top notch and colors pop out. Sound quality from speakers is little flat and less as per my liking . Haptics are pretty bad and does not feel good while typing. It's made of plastic but looks good with skin. And finally the exynos 9611 is now pretty old and not good. It heats up quite a lot, phone suffers stutters while multitasking and cannot play games in good graphics. Other cons might be nitpicking but processors really based. Although I don't play .uch games and for regular usage and content consumption it's good.Made in India :)

"
"

  Battery life is amazing, more then 12 hours screen on time in youtube watching.Charging speed could be better.When you charge in switch off phone charges more quickly compared to in on conduction.Camera quality is decent 👌👌👌.I brought it for 12699 now price increase to 13499...It's a superb deal for me.

"
"

  Over-all build quality is good, camera as super.Battery capacity is high but needs an optimization update, however it will work fine for more than 36 hours with normal usage.Face detection is excellent.Works Super smooth even after a week.Gorilla glass 3 is there however gorilla glass 5 could have been used.Screen quality is superb, auto brightness needs better adaptation.You can find better usage of AI technology in this phone from audio adaptation to live transcription.It is a perfect phone one can get in this price range, specially if you are seeking to not to buy a low quality Chinese phone.

"
"

  Steal the deal ..♥️♥️I m a regular user i dont do gaming purchased this one to watch series and other content bcz of its display, so the Device is really good in this budget....display is awesome...no lagging issues or any other heating problems in day to day tasks or while charging.....takes around 2 hours to get charge fully from 20% only con is...camera and image processing could be more improved bcz it gives a whitish shade to skin tone and overall image lookes a bit whitish...so saturation need to be improved....otherwise its a great great device at this budget😊

  The best phone in this price category. Everything is awesome. Battery lasts 2 days perfectly. Good camera and UI is very clean. Go for it.

"

  Using from last 12 Days. Phone is very good for basic day to day use. No Lags in day to day operations. This phone suit who use YouTube, WhatsApp and some other lite apps.Pros:1. Big Battery2. Amoled Display3. Good Camera Pictures in Natural light only.Cons:1. Worst Plastic Quality – Phone came with minor scratches2. Worst Selfie Camera – Struggle a lot in Artificial light specially at Night3. Missing Auto Focus – which is a basic feature even in a 6K phone.4. No Headphones, No Plastic case, not happy with Samsung cost cuttings.5. Battery charging take around 3h:15m from 0 to 100%. Better to charge in Night.6. Gorilla Glass 3 protection – I assume it is out of date in today’s time.7. Not Good for gaming.

  Good mobile. I using 15 days good battery backup. I'm playing free fire game smooth play good. Camera outdoor good but indoor not good. Display colour view amazing. Looking super mobile premium feel I love this mobile.

"
"

  Overall a good phone in this range.If you are Samsung admirer like me then you can go for this one. I have bought 6gb/128gb version and happy with it. Battery lasts for 54hrs on an average. Fast charging takes 1hr 20min to charge this tiny giant. Charging adapter should be more powerful when you are giving fast charging option. Camera good. There is no headphone and back cover in the box which is disappointing in this budget.

  Absolutely amazing purchase. Samsung has done a great job with this mobile.pros.displaybatterypricingno ads.conswell cons are not that concerning.loudspeaker could have been better (But still adequate)fingerprint sensor does not work if finger is bit sweaty.overall its a must buy.10/10

  I am writing this review after a month of usage. I usually use my phones just for browsing and calling purposes, not a gamer. Even then I face a lot of lag issues, the response rate is very bad on clicking an icon. Sound is also not that loud compared to my Nokia 5.1 Plus phone earlier. I feel this buy is a let down even from Nokia 5.1 Plus. Except the humoungous display size, I don't think its a good phone at all. Regretting this buy!!!

  I had brought this phone a week ago, initially I had faced battery some backup issues, I raised a return request and a replacement was provided and after using two days I had observed the mobile has issues, it operates on its own wish I did check the settings and restarted the phone a couple of time, however no change the device behaved the same manner. Finally I gave a called the Amazon CS they did try their level best to trouble shoot and finally even they gave suggested me for a refund.This clearly indicate this line of phone have a issues, which I never expected from a brand like Samsung.Buy it at your own risk.Regards

  Only positives - Great screen and good battery life.Negatives:- Hangs a lot and I only use it for calling and WhatsApp- If I leave it for half a day unattended, it restarts automatically and hangs at the boot screen. Stays there for hours if I don't force restart it.- Camera is ok, not that great.- Phone feels very heavy in hand.- Loses signal in the standby mode and only pulls receives the internet signals when unlocked.I made the mistake jsut because of the Samsung name. If possible, avoid this series. The RealMes and Mis are much better.

  I bought the midnight blue, 4GB-64GB variant of the Samsung Galaxy M21 for myself. I'm impressed with the phone's overall usability. Since i am not a heavy user unlike others, I decided to go for Samsung by considering the brand value and overall specs of the phone. The main requirements for me- Good display for media consumption, good battery life and a clean and easy to use UI without any unnecessary ads. Since the Galaxy M21 ticks all the right boxes I decided to go for this phone. Moreover i was using a Samsung Mobile prior to this and hence i was accustomed with the functionality of the UI.-The display of the phone is brilliant and at par with the Amoled display of my Redmi K20 Pro.-The battery life is also very good and it easily gives 1.5 days backup even under heavy usage. The only complain I have is the length of the charging cable which is very short.- The performance is good too for day to day usage. The Exynos 9611 is fairly capable and I haven't seen any stutter or lag in UI. If you are ahardcore gamer than I would recommend to look for alternative since it would not perform as good as its competition in regards to gaming. For casual gamers it will do the job well.-The cameras on this phone are brilliant with very good image processing done by Samsung. It takes pictures with natural colours.- The speaker output is average. Its loud enough but the sound produced is nothing impressive since it lacks bass and that clarity in the sound output.- The audio output via the 3.5mm Jack is very good as it supports Dolby Atmos.- The fingerprint sensor is very fast but the face unlock feature is not that consistent as it sometimes fails to read your face.Hence, overall it is a great value package from Samsung and I would highly recommend this phone to everyone looking for a good phone at this price point unless he/she is a heavy gamer. Thanks for reading.

  Been using it for a while after transitioning for LG G6. I have to say I am impressed by the built, speed and BATTERY LIFE of this device. 2 whole days battery life with heavy usage.Pro:1. Camera is good for the price2. SUPER AMOLED display is very sharp and crispy.3. Wide angle camera is a good feature.4. Monster battery life5. Hyper stable video is like a gimbal on its ownCon1. Fingerprint sensor sometimes has issues but face unlock work suprising well.2. Cannot switch between normal and wide angle camera in between recording.Overall a good buy for a medium range phone coming from a non chinese market thats MADIE IN INDIA.

I have tried 4 different different isp sim cards and complete all required network setting Or sim setting but net is not working but when I insert these sim Cards in another phone it works very well gives me 5 to 6 mbps speed but in this samsung phone internet isn't working....I am very frustrated from this network issue...  😔

  Undoubtedly you can go for it. Reason for purchase1. Display - You can't find this type display under 20000. Excellent display. Bright, colourfull, punchy.2. Bettery - Best bettery backup in this price range.3 Camera - Excellent camera, best picture clarity, full of details and colourful, punchy.Charger little bit slow, take time to charge but battery backup awesome.

  All the people who are in doubt about this phone that whether they should but it or not ..... I tell u that this phone is damn Amazing.... The camera ...the display...the battery is outstanding..... It's super smooth touch and the superb UI gives it a A class performance... Even if ur a pub g lover go for it... It just lags SOMETIMES in HIGHEST quality .... But if u will lower just one level of quality...it will give outstanding performance..... IN THIS PRICE RANGE ITS AN AWESOME PHONE

  First all M series phones are made in India. If you are looking good budget phones other than MI, Oppo, Vivo, then Samsung M21/M31 is phone which you can buy without any doubts.Dispay- 5/5Full HD screen plus SAmoled features gives better experience of picture qualityBattery 3/5Yes battery is 6000mAh and performs good but I observed that fast is not work properlyOs/processer 4.5/5Ui android 10Fingerprint/ face lock 3/5Very slow as compared to other phonesCamera 3.5/5Front and back camera are good but if compared to latest phones of MI, then you may disappoint about camera picture qualityOverall it is good budget phone.

  Bought this product after comparing the specs. To be Frank after receiving the phone ita a let down.1. The wifi connectivity has problem, reported to Amazon replacement is on the way.2. Bluetooth connection it takes exactly 132 seconds for the phone to detect and connect to an already paired bluetooth device which happens in other handsets in a matter of seconds.3. It boasts of 6 GB ram checked the memory first and it shows 3 gb of 6 gb available with 550 reserved for existing apps. Mind it this is on the first inspection even before installing any apps from play store.4. Phone gets stuck and has lags which is not expected from a brand new phone.5. Battery after two days use it's normal and drains quickly mind it I could install much dueto  the wifi issue it give can hour or two more than 4000 Mah battery and nothing more.6. My choice came to Samsung phone coz of the drive not to buy a Chinese brand Xiomi but in comparison to their note 8 pro the M21 fades away in terms of speed,quality and the overall performance.7. Phone is hanging just for opening chrome .Just to add Amazon folks were quick to replace the faulty set, now the bluetooth and wifi issue is resilved

  I am posting this review after using the mobile for 24 day. At first i thought its a decent one, but my mobile stopped working now. So, I approched new by samsung service centre they said that they need to replace the ""MOTHERBOARD"". Come on , a brand new mobile after using it for only 24 days the motherboard is not working. I Request amazon to extent the replacement period for the Electronics product which they sell to a ""MONTH ATLEST"".When I asked for replacement they said they can only repair the malfunctioned part and not replace it. HOW CAN I EVEN ACCEPT THIS, AFTER REPAIR IT ALMOST A REFURNISHED PRODUCT.  I PAID FOR A NEW MOBILE NOT FOR A REPAIRED  PRODUCT.

  Using for 60 days:Battery: Just a battery powerhouse for a job less man at home quartine. All it needs. I am a heavy user it goes nearly 24 hours of heavy use. 5-6 gaming 2-3 video 4-5 fb hours usage it can handle at a single charge. Camera:  Camera quality is not so good in potraits at a 2-3 meters range. All the camera effects and video effects are amazing. It can create random slow mo video at ease. Its the most fascinating feature though flash light is deeming while capturing. But in daylight its a master.Performance and Display: you can trust on android 10 with Samsung exynos that it can do hefty works in smoth way. Speed of internet is great. It can play pubg , free fire in medium and full display options. Easy ui interface. Sound quality is superb. Pro: battery, camera features, Ram , display, video watching, heavy uses, strong built, no heating problem, device care app.Cons: not water resistant, Camera zoom quality, weight, Camera capture time with flash, plastic back.

  Great product by Samsung at lower prices. Few points to mention after using for a week.1. Great super amoled display.2. Smooth UI on Android 10 latest version.3. Good camera with 20MP front. Camera experience is above average.4. Slight heating near speaker grill when playing audio. Speaker quality is average.5. Fast finger print sensor and face unlock.6. Full Charging took 2.5hr at least.7. Battery last for 2 days for normal use. Screen on time about 10hr on an average.8. Good processor and RAM management.9. It is not a gaming phone.10. Use tampered glass and back cover to protect the phone. Not included in box, purchase separately.11. Samsung brand value to consider.12. Over all good phone capable of doing daily normal task. Marking: 8/10.

  I was bit hesitant to buy Samsung Galaxy M-21. The reason being I was more interested in compact designs and small size phones. I used to have MI phones for the same reasons. But first time, I switched to Samsung and believe me I am more than satisfied.First and foremost thing, the big battery. Once charged, it is lasting for three whole days!  (on a medium use).  I check social networks, emails, messages regularly though don't call much. I am not a gamer too. But still 3 long days battery is worthy. Further, no battery heating issues on charging unlike with MI phones.Secondly, the AMOLED display. It is vivid, bright and sharp.Next comes the Camera. I read previews that the camera quality was so so. But look at the shots taken by me using Live Focus feature. The pics will speak for themselves.About performance, no issues... smooth and slick.I feel it brilliantly falls in  Value for Money category with Made in India tag.

  Amazing product.. switched from Xiaomi to Samsung as the device is fully assembled and manufactured in India at Samsung Factory, NCR and the company isn't ChineseThe product is quite power-packed the 48MP camera makes every shot precise and uniqueAndroid 10 feels too goodBattery life: well 6000mAh speaks enough about the battery life max to max it drops to 70%The sAMOLED makes video streaming gorgeousDolby Atmos.. the name is enough, people might feel choice of words odd but indeed the audio is like 'people are standing in front of you and singing the song' 😆The 4+64 varient seemed sufficient for me as I've 32 SD card plugged in tooTo all the Xiaomi users Samsung is doing better in the segment now.. go for it!Amazon prime delivery was good too received the order 2days before scheduledAmazing purchase experience 👌👍

  Not a bad phone at all...Considering the price point 13999 ..little over priced ...Pros1. Samsung display and the viewing angles are good2. Audio is good compared to Chinese craps3. Video viewing experience is good4. Call quality is goodAverage:1. Camera2. Battery backup is less when compared to 5000 mah capacity phones3.  Though no lags butnot for gamer..I don’t play games and I feel it’s good to go for daily usage4. Price point should be 11-12k max ...Options considered before buying this phone1. Nokia 5.3 ( rejected due to 720p display  and average camera)2. Poco m2 , poco m2 pro, redmi note 9 pro,......after seeing the device not at all impressed with UI ....and sound quality is worst even with Apple ear phones ...

UI:- 10/10Android 10 with One UI is awesome no issue yet.5. Processor and performance 9.5/10Exynos 9611 is not meant for PUBG gamers . But for me its perfect as I am not a mobile gamer.6. Charging :7.5/10. fast charging. but it take 3 hr near about to full charged.7. Accessories : 6/10No earphone, No Back cover, No Tempered.

  I bought this for 14k.  For 14k, you can definitely get very good specs in other brands. (Got HDFC 10% instant cashback).  Delivery on time as promised.I was very keen to avoid chinese phone and want to go with made in india phone.So left with very little choice among this 3 - Asus / Nokia / Samsung.  Asus not available online, Nokia has very limited battery and reviews not great.I generally like Samsung build quality, and now it is made in India, so decided to go with this.Its decent enough, good phone.  May not be value for money though considering the spec with other chinese brands.But good build quality, and comes with Android 10 / On UI.  So far getting patch updates regularly.Battery may not be as impressive as it claims. But still serves 1.5 days so far.Exynos 9611 SoC with 4GB RAM is average, not great, not bad.Display is good as well.Buy screen guard and back cover as it is fingerprint magnet.

  I have decided to put my review after 1.5 months of usage, I opted samsung only for a single reason that it's a non chinese brand..Now, talking about the performance of the phone, so far this comes out to be a good phone on all the parameters and there are no lags in the phone.. Camera quality is satisfactory and good with fair details, both front and back cameras will give close to natural colored pics, one should not expect DSLR in 14000 bucks..Battery back up is decent, you will get one full day i.e.24 hrs back up if you are heavy user, with moderate use u will get little over 30-32 hrs of back upFingerprint sensor is not very fast and prompt but it serves the purpose very wellProcessor who cares about whether its snapdragon or exynos, all hyped created by online reviewers, if you are a normal user and dont play heavy games you will not be able to figure out the difference between the two processors and this processor works fine and gives good performance in daily usage with no lagsScreen is super Amoled which is the USP of this phone at 14000 bucks, picture quality is good and colour contrast is also quite punchy..I dont think any other company provides the S Amoled display at this price range, I have compared the picture resolution of M21 with one plus 7 and there is a difference of 19-20  only  and do consider the pricing as well while comparing this phone with a phone having  price of more than 36000 more than double the price of this phone , so that ways this is bang on..Audio quality is good with ear phonesCall reception, network connectivity works fine with no lagsAreas of improvement-No LED  indicators which is quite disappointing at this priceLooks and build quality is not that good, quite simple with no glass back Charging takes 2.5 hours to fully charge the phoneGo for non chinese product with very little compromise over looksGo for this non chinese brand over chinese phone and you will not regret ur choiceI did a lot of research before purchasing this one.. so samsung M21 overall offers a good package with outstanding picture quality and color contrastIn case you find this helpful in your decision making, do like this review.

  Firstly this phone comes with almost all the features you need in a phone. I'm a teenager so I know. If you compare specs all the time you won't ever be able to decide but here the company name says a lot as Indians have trust with Samsung.Pros: Good battery back upThe camera is up to mark especially night view and wide-angle viewHaving a big battery didn't felt like a heavy phoneAlready comes with many inbuilt settings to play withA faster chipset in this price rangeSpeaker sound is well more than what we expectDual apps availableViewing angles are great as we get SUPER amolded screenCons: face lock is not up to the markMore charge time but I feel its worth it tooBeing honest nothing more till now cause it been just a few weeksOverall I would recommend you to buy it. Valur for money :)

  Build quality is great. The phone looks amazing. Easy to carry and handle. For the size, the phone is surprisingly  light. Camera is very good. Battery life is good and the phone easily gives one full day of regular usage. Screen is vivid and immersive. Fingerprint scanner is quick and accurate.  Charging time is little long even with fast charge. Lightening  charge would be an awesome addition.

"
"

  Writing this review after around 15 days of extensive use.1) Battery: Battery life is the best in this budget. Once charged, backup is atleast 1.75 complete days. It takes around 2.5 hours to charge this gigantic battery with the in-box 15 watt charger.2) Camera: Well comparing with other phones in this price range, this is simply the best. Also, Samsung Galaxy M31 is also a good option, but didn't find any difference between this two when I compared the images.3) Processor: Both the GPU and CPU are decent enough. Not a PubG fan, but to test it once, I ran a few rounds of PugG and Fifa Mobile. Didn't lag even once.4) Overall Texture Quality: Body is made of plastic. This could've been better if it was single metallic body. The rear look is not so great, but anyways you can always cover it with Back covers of your choice.Overall Rating : 4.5/5Cons:1) They should've given 20 Watts charger, as it takes 2.5 hours with the current charger to fully charge it from 0 - 100%.

  This is the best Smartphone under 15K . Don't even think twice... just go for it.Pros:1. Best Display:  FHD+ super amoled display is far better than IPS display. If you start using it , you will never like any IPS lcd phone. Colours are very attractive in super amoled. Nowadays I feel IPS lcd displays dull.2. 6000mah battery lasts more than one day even after heavy usage .3. Camera is best in daytime. Even night mode is better than any phone under 15k. So, you won't be disappointed on camera.4. Samsung One UI is clean and ad free. There you won't be disturbed by ads . Nowadays Chinese phones show full of ads. Samsung is great by this way.5. THIS IS NON-CHINESE! This makes m21 more safe and secure.6. Exynos 9611 is not a bad processor as YouTube reviewers says. It can handle high graphics game in high settings .7. The camera has some great features like colour pic...Main object remains colourful while background becames black&white(watch the image). This looks great!... so onCons:1. There is no earphone or backcase. Company should give atleast backcover.2. Length of cable is short.3. Exynos processors are not very good for playing  long time. Still you can play PUBg  4-5 hrs but Mobile heats up a little .Final verdict: If you have a budget less than 15k, you should buy this. This is better than Chinese phones. Don't listen to YouTube reviewers,  Chinese companies pays them for promotion.  M21 is better than any phone at this price!

  Overall a good phone - 6k MAH battery with 6GB, 128GB in 15k + 500 for accessories is not that bad.Battery lasts 24+ hours with wifi ON continuously.Looks good, sleek and stylish. But with cover, every phone looks ugly and bulky, same goes here as well.Camera configuration appears very high but it failed to impress me so far. Didnt find it very great.Speakers - it sounds little cacophonous.  It feels like it has only 2 volume settings, same low for first 50% and same loud for remaining 50%, nothing in between.  And it doesnt appear to give any sound effects, sounds something odd compared to my previous  phone.After the OS upgrade, realised that whatsapp or messenger calls do not show up on the screen, it only rings. So I have to first open WhatsApp and then tap the top of screen to get options to pick up. Not sure whether it's an issue with phone OS or WhatsApp, Messenger. Since, with earlier phone as well, I had issues with these two services where it wouldn't even ring at my side unless I have opened them. But the caller would hear the phone buzzing. Here, at least it rings.All in all, depending on your usage, feature that matters to you, make your purchase decision.And yes, the box says its ""Made In India"" so you may want to forego some of the drawbacks I mentioned above. Given a chance I can buy it again.

  I am a student of BTech, in side I am doing freelancing. From the my earnings I bought this Samsung M21 for my dad as a birthday gift. And it was amazing experience. Don't think too much Samsung is Samsung. Yes it's price is little bit high compare then MI. I have Redmi 7 Pro. I like MI device. But after using samsung m21 I can say. Go for samsung M21. I had planning of buy Redmi 9 Prime for dad. But then I changed my decision to Samsung M21. And it was perfect decision 😌Pros- Battery Life- Icon color & Video quality- Very responsive touch- Camera quality- Better UI & Amazing display- No ads- Call quality, wifi strength is good- Sound is good and in terms of display samsung is always best.- Good for rough & tough use- Made in India🇮🇳Cons- Design should be better- At 15k price point back design is should be more better with Gorilla glass like Redmi 7 Pro- Finger print is quite difficult sometime- No access of Major samsung apps like Samsung Pay- Limited colours of range- No backcase in box.- If you are a MI user then display will be a little bit yellow in compare to MI device.But My dad loves the phone❤️, he is too much Happy because I have gifted this phone to him from my earnings.

  Overall, the phone is quite a decent one. It has amazing battery life and a wonderful AMOLED screen. But these are the only things that can be considered above average.What really dissappointed me is the camera quality. The photos taken in good lighting are really great, but those in moderate light suffer. Low light photographs suffer the most as they are abysmal. You can use open camera with noise reduction to get somewhat better quality. Which tells you that it's Samsung itself that are limiting the output of a certainly good camera hardware setup.Moving on to the fingerprint sensor. It's fine. It's fast when it works, but you need to cover it completely with your fingertips, which annoys me. Other phones, and older ones too, in this price range have a much better fingerprint sensor.The processor is powerful enough for daily tasks. That's it. Samsung seems to have just one processor. It's so stupid that they put Exynos 9611 in every phone these days. You cannot play games that well. I tried Asphalt at default settings and there was lag and frame drops. I do not game much, so it's fine for me.The speaker is not sufficiently loud.I like Samsungs OneUI. It is clean and well optimised. I say this coming from MIUI11. What I do miss is the network speed option in the status bar and the three finger screenshot gesture, which were available in MIUI.The 6000mAh battery is the highlight of this phone. The downside is the charging speed. But that's OK for me. The phone lasts 1.5 to 2 days based on your usage.Finally the screen. It is something I have no complaints about. Bright, punchy and great for media consumption. The screen was a major factor for me to buy this phone.

"
"

  1.Display is Super No doubt about it.2.Camera is good.3.Battery is good enough but not that much good as per expectations from 6000mah battery.4.No irritating adds like other chines smartphones5.user interface is goood6.Finger print sensor works well and fast7.Battery drains fast  in PUBG game I dont if its common in all other spartphone.And its manufactured in India (not all parts but as compared to other chines phones Samsung manufactures most of the parts in India) that is the reason I bought Samsung by paying little bit extra to samsung than chines phones.

  This phone is having best of the best features except for some small features which would have made the phone awesome to have. But without those features also this is the best phone to have currently in the market. I missed notification and charging indicator in the phone. Battery performance is not upto the mark. I was expecting more battery life for 6000mAh. But I have to charge atleast once a day.

  Hello guys . This is Anubhab . I am basically a tech friendly guy. So I want here an there to find a perfect phone for me. And also I made tech videos in bengali. Anubhab' Tech.At first I describe the feeling when I got it into the hand. The mobile gives you a reliable feeling at first. It is because of Samsung brand. When you boot your phone the UI gives you a clean and clear look with no blotwares or ads. Which you gets in other Chinese smartphone. It is basically runs on One UI and andriod 10.After that it comes to camera Samsung's camera is too good. Various types of mode is available here on video recording, like slow mo ,super slow mo, steady mode etc. 48 mp camera tooks a very detailed pictures. And front is also good . But you get 4:3 frame in 48 mp as usually like other mobiles too.Then comes the battery . It is a 6000 mah monster battery. It canes with 15 watt charger which complete your charging at least 2 hours to 2.30 hours. I recommend you to turn on airplane mode while charging. This thing will fast your charging speed. Display is quite impressive . Super amoled dispay drains battery lesser. Biometrics. The fingerprint sensor is fast but face unlock is slightly less fast. But it doesn't matter.Gameplay: I play pubg in Hdr and ultra frame rate . The game play is slightly laggy. But if you play it with HD and Ulta frame rate it will perform smooth . And I also mention that if you play pubg in smooth setting then you will get the extreme frame rate. Which I used to play .Thats all . Thank you

  This is my first samsung phone. I purchased this because I don't want to purchase a chinese mobile. But interestingly, this phone is great surprise for me. Light weight, superb display n battery. I watch many videos in youtube n watch films on Netflix, it's just perfect for me as the amoled display is awesome. I need not to charge it frequently n I use it all the time without any issues. Camera quality, I find it better than Xiaomi phones in this price range, ya true.

"
"

  its really very ""kaam Chalau"" phone, in this range, and as i expected about the touch panel of samsung, its little bit hard touch and also for fingerprint is not so much quick responsive and the software which are pre-loaded are not so much useful, and talking about the speed, it is very disappointing, while updating and installing the software it takes so much time, specially from the samsung store, and the theme store is also not good, all are purchase items there, and no ringtone download is there. Only thing is the best in this mobile is that the camera and screen quality.volume buttons are bit higher to reach. one most important features is missing from this mobile is capturing the screen shot, no shortcut key in quick panel, as samsung should think about this, traditional screen shot system is there, press and hold the volume down and power key simultaneously.

  It is truely a great experience with this device. In one word it is awesome!! Camera quality  is very good. Output speaker sound is loud, distinct and the microphone  of this  phone is sensitive enough. Display is bright and eye soothing. Finger print readers is works quite well. Battery life is... o my god!! More than what i expected... 2 days easy battery life with normal usage... with heavy usage it can last upto one day at least.... overall a mustbuy phone.. i want to recommend  it to all... thank you amazon for in time delivery...

  I am writing this review after 3 months of usage. I am not a gamer but sometimes play. So the reader should take that into consideration. Battery is good. Even battery be 15% it will works for about 1 hour with hotspot open. Take around 2:30 to 3 hrs to charge. Camera is Decent. You can sometimes find some problem with network connection where there is weak connectivity.Cant say much about sound quality but for normal user it is good(atleast it is good enough for me). Before buying this phone i read this is not best suited for gamers.

"
"

  A nice phone regarding the price, brand and usage objecives. Certainly not a phone for Heavy Camera users or Heavy Gamers as the camera unit starts to heat the top side of front screen as soon as you start the camera and the rise is rapid and as for gaming processor issues. But if your uses are like me i.e. watsapp, facebook, google, WPS Office etc then this phone is awesome.The fingerprint reader is fast when it reads, but the slightest of dust or sweaty fingers and the reader just goes bye bye, but overall reliable. The battery surely is humongous and the backup shows. 2 days is no issue. As for camera quality the images are fine no issues as such just that there is heating issue. As soon as you start the camera the top side of front screen starts to heat, and keeps heating gradually and after the camera is turned of the temperature comes down gradually.I bought the phone because I wanted a no frills calling, browsing and social media device with lots of space and big battery. Plus the issue of privacy also was important for me. Samsung just felt relaiable then the chinese brands.

  M21 is an average phone with nothing special about it. Everything about it is average.  Here I want highlight that this phone does not have knox facility hence lot of samsung add on programme does not work. I was eager for Secure Folder but later came to know it is knox based and hence cannot run. Many M series Samsung phone does not have knox and runs on One UI Core.Choise is yours

"
"

  M21 is excellent budget smartphone and competes with most Chinese brands on specifications and price front. The display brightness and  battery life are excellent. My only complaint to Samsung is they have not included fast charger with product. It takes hours to charge with built in charger. But when I used my other fast charger, the mobile started charging fast.Further, I found it slow as against my Galaxy S9+ and it is obvious as Galaxy s9+ is premium category phone and outperforms M series on all fronts. Overall, I liked the phone. Worth investing for middle range.

  6 GB ram,128 GB ROM, AMOLED display for Samsung phone 15k is good pricing.*This phone is especially for lite to moderate users.* great display* decent battery life* lag-free ONE UI 2 (compared to older Samsung phones)* if you push this phone for heavy games, it will heat up a bit and frame drops (Not a good phone for PUBG)

"
"

  Camera quality is good. Front camera or back camera, both perform well in day light and perform decent is low light with flash. Built quality is also fair as it doesn’t look that bad. Battery life isn’t that good as it’s 6000mah but performs like 4500-5000mah but with power saver on it performs really good. Display is amazing.Fingerprint reader is super fast and face unlock works good in day light.User interface is really nice and well organized and not many stupid apps.Processor wise also the phone works well and you can play PUBG for 2 hours continuous without any problem.

"

  Good and decent mobile handset,But GST increase price is high than launching price,But Handset performance is Very Good for Normal to moderate use.Camera quality is also Good,I recommend to buy this mobile under this price range, Good mobile than other Chinese Handset with fake(made in India label).I suggest this phone in this price segment.

  Its jusa a super product.... love to ise a whole day without charging.... camera is awesome ... and the speed of the phone is good. Im a shop keeper i dont play much games , so its very useful for my daily business call records and online payments.... thanks and the price is bit heigh. But i can compromise to support for my country.

  *Unbiased and True Experience Only*Since Samsung has understood the Game of Midrange Smartphone Market. Here is my Take on M21Pros:1. Battery Life : Believe me , You will miss charging the Phone alot. About 8-9 Hours of Screen time is Guranteed on a Regular Usage(No-Gaming). The Battery is Much efficient, Each % gives about 10 mins of Screen Time.2. Processor : Except for Gaming, It won't Lag in your Daily Usage. Excellent Response time.3. Display: The Only Reason of me Buying this Device was SAMOLED Display. If you haven't used Amoled yet, Go Experience it now.4. UI : One UI is is like butter + Samsung gives you soo much control over device including Native VPN, APPLOCK etc.Charging: People are whining for 15W charging, Believe me its more than Enought. This phone will give you 2 days battery on a Moderate Usage, So you charging this once in two days for 2 Hours is Equal to a Your Friend Charging his Twice in 2 days for 1+1 Hour.Cons: Since I am Not a Gamer, Haven't Found any Cons in Phone. But yeh Plastic Back is a Fingerprint  Magnet and is prone to Damage so I suggest you go for Ringke Cover for (Rs. 899). You don't wan't to give 9K for Amoled Display so invest in BackCover.*Gamers, Stay Away, Not for you.*For-Photography LoversBig Battery LoversUI loversand SpeciallyEntertainment (Movies/Videos/Music) Lovers.Update: Camera App Lags when you try to close it. It clicks Blank/Black Pictures Many times.  Battery is Superb.

  Worst phone with this high price. I am patriot so did not purchase Chinese phone but this samsung phone can not be replacement of even MI low budget phones. Camera quality is not as good as 48mp should be and can not talk with anyone on speaker mode ( too much low volume). Will never recommend anyone to buy this phone with hard earned money.

"
"

  Not recommendedThis phone is full of specs + best non Chinese phone under 15000But it's software is not that goodPROS1) CameraCamera is awesome. No need to wait for camera to focus on the object.Lots of camera mode available in the camera app.2) DisplayThe sAMOLED screen is awesome. The blue light filter is awesome. FHD+ resolution is good. The screen feels smooth but ruined after using the screen guard. You get an option for increasing sensitivity.3) UIOne UI 2.0 is full of pros and cons.It packed with Antivirus software.(McAfee)But some features are reduced from original one UI 2.0

"
"

  Battery : Battery is good and gives an adequate performance.Processor :  I didn't found any lag in my day to day usage. I am not gamer but it fulfills all my daily tasks without any lag.Display : It is just beautiful and looks extra ordinarycharging : charging takes around 3 hours to get fully charged but that is ok for 6000 maH battery and in the current budget. one can keep adding the budget if he is keen to increase the features.Samsung UI : Samsung comes with some bloatwares which can either be uninstalled or disabled but the UI is good and contains lot of additional features.Sound : Atmos is supported through headphones which gives pleasant experience and speakers are loud enough. Can be slow for the Chinese phone users.Final Verdict : For a normal user who wants a beautiful display , powerful battery and a non Chinese phones to avoid the spyware on your activities then this phone is great phone in budget.

  A great smart phone...Nothing to say about its display...fingerprint scanner is fast but i must say that the face unlocking is a little bit slow...battery is really 'Watta Monster'...15 watt first charging with USB type C is not bad...it takes about 2 and half hour to get completely charged (0 to 100%)...and drainage of battery depends on usage...but light usage of the phone  can run it for almost 2 days...camera quality is great and the selfies are quite good and sharp...video quality is also good and the noise cancelling mic is also doing a good job...sound is obviously loud but not as good as expected ...but in terms of gaming like pubg mobile or Call of Duty mobile I found it lagging sometimes but not much.This smartphone is not for gaming but it is for students who needs to do online classes as it has a monster battery...and also for its sAmoles display...I also chose it as a student...If you are a student then go for it...

  Liked It for some reasons….1.The Galaxy M21 is a smartphone that offers a massive 6,000mAh battery.2.It’s got a great AMOLED display with HD streaming support .3.This smartphone is extremely lightweight.Thanks to the glossy nature of the plastic, the phone is very susceptible to fingerprints.4.The 48-megapixel main sensor on the Galaxy M21 is excellent. With sufficient lighting, the pixel-binned photos came out great.

"

  Samsung M21, 6 GB, 128 GB RAM. EXYNOS 10 NM Processor, Samsung 48 MP main back camera. Most importantly Amoled display with AOD. No back cover in case. Good price. The brand is better for people who want to use it for long period. It will stay with you at least for 3 years. Don't fall for the 5G processors, 5G won't be there in India at affordable rates till 2025. It is better deal than Redmi, Vivo, Realme or Oppo. Fingerprint reader is superfast. If you like to watch videos, view pictures or read a book, it is better device than above brands upto price range of Rs.35k.

  Samsung should build some more cell phones like these and variants under 10K as well. This is truly a good cellphone with crisp & clear vivid OLED Display for 14K.SUPER DISPLAY! 5/5Camera performs very well in both daylight and night. You need to be patient and keep in mind you're not holding a 45K plus phone or dslr in your hand for faster shutter speed.Glitches are there ,expecting to be resolved in future updates. The clarity is good even with the selfie camera. Less modes are there , but yeah I use Camera MX so no issues.  4/5Battery life is also upto the mark only disadvantage is the charging time. No fast charging or high watt charger bundled. Not a BiG Problem at all. 4/5Fingerprint is also accurate and works very well. 5/5The UI is typical Samsung UI some bloatware is there , you can uninstall some except the Samsung apps. 4/5Sound is a bit low compared to the MI and REALME , basically ""CHINESE"" devices. However , again not a problem can workout with high volume ringtones for phonecalls. 🤘🏻 3.5/5Body build quality is also good with kind of plastic and metal combination. Colour blue looks premium. Bought tempered glass and back cover together. They arrived early though 🤪. 4/5Headphone jack is also available and the volume rockerz plus power button are on the same side of the phone.Tip- screenshot capture is a bit delay , you need to tap the volume down + power just once and leave , after 2 secs you will be able to see the screenshot capture is processed. There's a visible delay in this. ☝️ Overall for the body options - 4/5Final verdict - In this price range , Samsung is coming back to gain the market and should avail the opportunity (current china ties reservations) to do so by providing more options and more features from 5K till 15K range.Samsung Galaxy M21 - 4.5 / 5.Display is SUPER ! ✨Got it with some discount using Amazon Pay ICICI card and Exchanging Old device. 🤘🏻

  Never give a chance to regret.. Go ahead...👍The Icons looks was not so great .. And then I set'Spherlue Icons' from theam and now its looks better with dark mode ...Even though its 6000 Mah I always leaves phone on charging before go to bed ( I like to see my phone 100% every morning 🙂 )..

Superb Display3.Design:4/5It has a6000Mah battery, still looking not bulky. Noglass body, but who cares after you put a back cover.. In my opinion, don't spend more money for glass body if you uses back covers4. Camera: 4/5Back camera pretty good but front camera's low light output is very low.. many features available such as slow and super slow videos available..5.

  More than after a week of usage, iam extremely disappointed with Samsung M21 phones performance, it is getting hanged, biometric unlocking is not functioning properly... Face recognition is not working since day 1... Apps gets started on their own even with out touching screen at times.... Pathetic phone... Don't go for it... I had purchased the phone on Samsung trust... But it was my mistake.

  Very bad on the product delivered.Received a defective piece.Hold with me almost a month without no use.my money got stuck with Amazon which did not allowed me to buy another mobile.My EMI started without using the product.Finally got returned after a  month.Never seen this with Amazon since I'm with them for past 10yrs.And moreover,have lost Rs.1500 discount from the banker on the offer.

  This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag. First time I ordered on the first day of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.Good:- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.- 6000 Mah battery is BIG- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good- Received next day by 11 AM !Not So Good:- Not that thin, but ok.- Doesn't have Samsung Dex- Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue at all.- Feels delicate in hand but a Rs.49 cover was good enough. Wrongly ordered black while the set is blue. Just 49 so will reorder the blue one as well :)- Called Samsung Store, but no information with them about availability date. Still no call from them.Feedback- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.Go for it without any doubt.

  3rd class front camera. 32 MP front camera n looks like 2mp front camera. In very disappointed  with this kind of front camera. Need refund.

"

  Lets just begin with the obvious. This phone's quality doesn't meet the claims made.Cons:1. Camera Quality: Picture quality is just awful. Its worse than a 8MP camera. The pixelization is obvious and it is definitely not a 64MP camera. Do not believe the claims Samsung might make. The quad camera is of no use as the macro camera reminds me of the decade when VGA cameras were common.2. Battery: Samsung may claim the battery will last for two days but it didnt last that long - no Netflix, Prime Video, heavy games being used. So that makes two of the biggest features useless.3. Amazon's Policy: In case you don't like the phone, Amazon has made sure you are stuck with it. The switch from 10 day ""return"" policy to 10 day ""replacement"" policy is dowright wrong! Hold onto the shutters physical mobile stores - your days are not over yet. When you do request for replacement, there is an inspection of the phone at buyer's site - which I understand but the fact that replacement will occur almost on the 10th day from my purchase still keeps me at unease.Pros:1. Display: The screen quality is good and has adjustment options for warm light and cold light.2. Performance: Streaming videos and playing heavy games was smooth for the first 4 days but then again Samsung is known for fast deterioration of performance, so I will keep my eyes and ears open.3. Sound: Speaker quality is okay but not upto the mark. In a noisy place you fail to hear the crispness and the boom.

  I am using it from 3 days , 6000 mah battery is just for name only, it work for 1-1.25 days only with moderate usage.64mp camera doesn't support zoom, camera doesn't support 60fps video recording.Build quality is not good, plastic back with lots of figure prints in few minutes handling, not look new in few seconds.Face unlock very slow.Heat issue which charging and heavy usageFull charge takes more than 3 hrsWould not recommend to buy , if you are looking  for good camera phonego with other brands like oppo or redmi , giving much better quality

  The phone was wrapped in dust. Although it was seal packed, still many dust were on screen and back side. It shows security concerns and Amazon, Samsung and seller must draw its attention. How dust can be reached in seal packed box? Now I'm lacking trust in Amazon,Samsung and seller. Either my phone was used or its components might have replaced, as in brand new phone,there exists no dusts because they are built in factory, but here shows how they are playing with the customer and their product.Phone is nice, large battery backup of more than 2 days, 6.4 display is big, camera is perfect and 6GB ram is enough for daily usage. All things are good. No heating issue.However my only concern is ""dust"" and how it came there if its brand new.So I could give 5 star,but now 1 is enough.Beware of Amazon,Samsung and seller.

  Phone camera is not good , samsung says it's 64 mega pixel but its photos like 8 megapixels .photo detailing are not good  . Also processor is not Upton the mark it's some time slow and hang in multi function use . While using keyboard , keyboard hide automatically for 1 second . My mobile variant is 6 GB 128 GB. Don't waste your time and money .

  Not a Samsung performance. It seems it was launched without proper test n trials. I already had M30 so decided to buy M31 (6GB). But got shocked to see the poor performance n battery life. The 64MP images can't be sent easily to someone on WhatsApp. Camera give errors now n then. Battery life worst then M30 which has 5000mh. Mobile heats on charging.

  1. First of all let me tell you  that previously I have used Moto G2, Moto G4 Play & Lenovo K8 Note.2. I'm writing this review after 3 days of usage, using the 128GB version.3. PROS.(a) A great delivery experience by Amazon, within 24hr delivery, the phone is sleek & stylish to look at.(b) Battery backup(6000MAh) is just awesome.  For an average user like me, it lasted for two days in a single full charge.(c) Very very smooth processor, as compared to other phones in this price range like Oppo and Mi. Works like a flash.(d) Brand value of Samsung at this price with the latest specs.(e) With quad camera & a 64MP main camera, pretty amazing photos are clicked. The low light camera is particularly helpful.(f) If you are a fan of AMOLED display, this is the phone for you.(g) No problem of overheating while usage or charging.4. CONS.(a) With a 15W charger, it is charging slow taking almost 2.5hrs for a full charge, especially when compared to OPPO VOOC charger.(b) Not a very rugged phone, you might need to use a back cover from Day 1.5. I'm satisfied with the phone & the experience it provides. Overall, I would totally recommend you to go for Samsung Galaxy M31, as at this price range, with the specs  & brand value of Samsung, this is the best buy. 👍

  Not satisfied with the qualityDisplay quality is no adequateBody is made of plastic like materialI was using MI like 6 plus pro then 7 plus proFor a change I have purchased this product, the quality is not up to the mark when comparing to my old redmi note seriesThe sound quality is very worst.While making call with full volume it is not clear from the day of purchase.I am planning to go back to MI againWorst phone pls don't buyNot value for money

"
"

  I purchased this as soon as it was launched and its one of the worst decision that i made. Selfie camera is blurry and clicks yellow pictures, phone lags in playback video, all of a sudden, video will disappear and only sound continues to play, back camera isn't that great as hyped, its very low in quality, body of the phone is more like a plastic and very low quality material, overall very dis-satisfied with the product. Amazon has agreed post diagnosis saying its a faulty piece  but does not give refund

  HiI am using M31 Since 6/3/2020.Those who are interested to buy this set, please follow my real Review before buying M31.1) Phone Display is excellent. It is a good Video viewing experience.2) In Day light, Rear Camera photos are good but sometimes its colour is yellowish which is very bad effect in image. Even in Night light or low light Selfie is not clear, you have to use Night Mode but Outdoor Selfie is excellent. It has 8x Digital Zoom which is extra benefit. In this price Zoom Quality is not bad.3) 4K Video shot in both Real and Front Cameras, the Video Qualities are amazing.4) Fingerprint Scanner is good but Face unlock is Average.5) Battery Optimization is not good. At present, it takes around 3 hours to complete charge from 6 to 100%, which was previously 2.5 hrs. I do not use any high graphic App.6) It has no support of Secure Folder and Knox.I think that Samsung is required to update in section of Camera, Battery and to add Secure Folder App to compete other Chinese brand Like Xiaomi, Realme, Poco etc.Thanks.

  One of worst mobile and one of the worst brand. Better to purchase any other brand except Samsung.1. Heating issue2. Second sim works on 3g.3. Even its 6Gb ram works like 2gb ram phone.When I called amazon customer care they said I have to go to service center for this and they are telling to check through app.Its a f***ing phone please please please don't waste your money.And this is my last ever purchase from amazon.

"

  Cons:Button position (power& volume) too highFingerprint reader too highHeats up a lot.Though the battery capacity is high, battery drains fast.A lot of bloatware. Removed loads of stuff, tons still left.A full charge with original charger and original cable (which is quite short) from 0-100 took 2 hours & 28 minutesSpeaker volume low.The receiver causes voice drop in phonecalls.Pros:Feels lightweightNice display.The camera is decent.Update 1:Drained the battery to 0% and switched it off and charged to 100% and the battery seems to hold charge longer.Update 2:Outgoing voice gets cut for a few seconds at a time consistently. Going to request a replacement.Update 3:Returned my M31, found the voice unclear and faced voice drop. When I put my SIM card into my old Moto G5S+ the recipient immediately recognizes the much better voice quality. I have to put the call on 100% volume to be able to hear at least a bit.

  I bought this mobile in last Friday , it is not working from 6th day.  Unable to receive calls and if unexpectedly I received a call not getting  sound and I can't here the opposite person voice or my voice to them. When I try to call someone automatically network is getting disconnected and it's reconnecting automatically in few minutes. I expect this might be  software issue , I have gone through lot of reviews ,maximum number of people who buyed this mobile facing this issue.Unable to replace the mobile also as it is not showing any option to me.

  I have been using this for 15-20 days now and I am even more disappointed!I have been using POCO F1 since the last 1.5 years and I regret to have chosen to move back to Samsung!I so miss my POCOFirst the pros1. The brand name - if you think it is one!2. The display - It's super AMOLED and it's brilliant3. The rear camera - clicks good enough photos4. Build - seems decentCons:1. The UI - It's a big duffer. Samsung's smart switch was a pathetic attempt to move the contacts etc. Had I not cross checked, I would have been crying2. The contact list - It seems like using an age old NoKia device today3. Virtual Buttons - They aren't customizable 😭. What kinda innovation is this4. Clear all apps - it kills the current app too😬. I killed my game many times while trying to fasten up this idiot device5. Gaming - The phone slows down in 10-15 minutes. It's anyways a slow device6. Front camera - it no better than an age old 2MP camera. The image processing is idiotic7. Notifications - This idiot forgets to send email notifications. I have to manually keep checking my emails😭. Believe me, I have tried all settings8. Notification Badges - Does not display any badges on the apps 😂🤣. You have to pull down the notification bar and keep checking9. Dual Apps: This idiot does not support dual apps. Only messengers are supported. I have two accounts on amazon and amazon is not supported in dual apps. Similarly I have two accounts to manage on Linkedin.The more I use this idiot device, the more it frustrates meAnyone who recommends Samsung can kindly stay away from me nowWhat a waste of Money this has been

  1) claims 21 hour of internet usage timing, i started using it after 100charged  but it barely last for 24 hour with 5 hour of heavy usage and even turned mobile in bettery saving mode.  so what is the point of carry that much heavy 191gm device all around.2) phone heats a lot while its charging ,like you can't even touch it at some point.3)internet bandwith speed in mobile as well as in wifi is not good. i had a samsung galaxy note3 where i get fast internet with same network. wanted to return this device but they had a very strict policy so you cannot return, you can only replace it.  even i am trying it for replacement it wont let me as i have to download balencco app and this app never say your phone is not working fine. i could have spend my money in buying other phone.bought on very first minute of release but al excitment turned down after seeing actual performance.

  Over all am not that super satisfied, but excellent one & not made in chn..Pros# Good LiveFocus camera, Shallow DoF is excellent# sAmoled Display is great# Good features# You will love using the phone.Cons# Slow-motion video sucks goes dark# Macro lens has lot of distortion# Charging sucks needs 2.5hrs to get full charge, 6000mah is good but discharges 1.5day for normal usage.# Slight heat while charging..# 9 out of 10 times doesn't recognise your face during low light, figer print reader is also slippary# Poor mobile & Wifi Signal scanning# Phone is slippary in hand use protective case always.Over all I didn't get the feel I expected for this price range..

  Received it on time within 24 hours thumps up to amazon. Now Product. Done all the settings. I am using samsung after a long gap of 8-10 years. After Samsung Grand I had stopped using. So setting done now data transfer Samsung's smart switch option is fantastic. Everything I wanted to transfer got it. No problem at all .Now SIM transferred. Done OK it is dual 4G VOLTE and above all it is having separate slot for micro sd card. Effortless working.Now Camera. It has got lot of options. All I have not yet tried but for sure I have checked the quality of the photograph and the night mode is superb. What else you want to know rest of the things are written in detail and is true. Working very fine. Proud to won it. Nice Product. Samsung should keep competing iPhone

  Cons:1. RAM. Claims to be 6GB, whereas my 2year old phone with 4GB RAM has much smoother display2. Battery Charging. Claims 15W fast charging. Takes more than 2 hours to charge the phone.Pros:1. Good cameras2. Perfect screen sizeI bought it as a great deal from Samsung, but it is a BIG dissappointment. And they say it cannot be returned. Total waste of money for me. Redmi Note pro 8 is much better than this at same price.

  What is this samsung,i didn't expect from you.plastic body is ok we can use cover.Corning gorella glass 3 is ok we can use tempered protection.Even 3 hr charging time is ok we can charge during night.But Overheating how can we deal with them !this price range other companies providing super fast , cool processor like snapdragon 730G.& What you do fooling customers.

"
"

  i am a Big fan of Samsung products, but today i got a dead phone, first i thought it don't have charging so try to charge the phone but no response,i am really really disappointed today. but thanks to amazon the responded quickly and ordered a replacement. but now i am worried about phone performance now. how i am going to handle if future same problem arises. before buy think again.

  Worst experience ever, camera quality not better 5out of 2, battery down very fast, max 3 hours taken charging 100% ,sometime WhatsApp hangups.108 gp free storage but mobile heating high, fingerprints only 3 finger available,  not better fingerprints,  I am the first buyer before launching. Over all don't buy this m 31. No extra protection, no additional option,  very simple mobile,not worthiness of money,

"
"

  First time met very bad experience from Samsung phone, camera quality is very poor. Front facing camera not good at all. Not comfortable with 6000mahbattery life.Amazon.india  just destroyed their Goodwill by selling this product.I purchased this phone for my friend. And now he is angry on me....Dear customer please avoid to buy this product.

"
"

  Very poor performance.. camera is ok not bad . But very slow net speed .. opening app time is relatively fast but after internet is very slow .... my old mobile Samsung on max is much faster performance for loading web page than Samsung m31 .. this phone taking much more time to open any web site ... remaining everything is ok ..Fast changing is not far like they said .. 30 mins charging it charging 20% but my old Samsung is 30% charged at same time . I have found this two major drawback.

"
"

  It's one of the good looking phone with stunning display & mammoth battery.Pros :1. One of the best display in the segment.( You'll feel it when you hold the phone for first time itself )2. Great battery life (6000 mAH ) with good optimisation.3. SAR rating - lowest one4.  Well weight balanced ( considering big mammoth battery )Cons :1. Samsung should have provided a case along with this ( hard to buy a case at initial days after launch _ phone is slippery and finger print & dust magnet )2. Camera is not so great as expected ( 64 MP)_ wide angle shots are lacking of details _ macro mode is also not great3. Not so great processorWho can buy : people who don't do heavy gaming & not camera oriented. Who looking for great battery & Samsung branding.

"
"

  I found the phone to be mediocre in performance.Pros:1. Display: Trust me it’s amazing! You will love the vibrant colours. Images and videos look great in the Amoled screen.2. Battery: 1.5 days backup even after heavy usage.3. Camera: Good, but not excellent.Cons:1. Build: All plastic build, this might have helped in managing the weight, but I guess the durability is compromised.2. Night mode camera: Useless, all grainy and inconsistent photos. Other phones in this price range are way better.3. Zoom camera: Photos are grainy and lacks clarity.4. Face unlock: Mostly doesn’t work even after adding alternate looks.Verdict: You can buy this if you don’t like the Skins of Chinese brands, One UI 2.0 is heavy but better. Hardware wise some Chinese phones are better.

  Delivery was fast, packing was good, phone started quite unusual that applications were not even downloading on wifi, later after a couple of restarts it's good now. So thumps up , happy so far .

  I ordered in first sale after comparing all the phones at this range and i am satisfied with this phone but want to discuss some pros and consPros:1. Back Camera is good ( i compared it with oneplus 7 and samsung is good). No issues with picture quality with zoom also.2. Its a powerhouse with High Battery Life (For normal usage we can even use phone for 2 days)3. No lag or hanging problem till now due to 6Gb RAMCons:1. Front Camera is not as good as expected2. Finger Print sensor is back mounted while all other brands offering in screen fingerprint sensors at this range. ( disappointed at this and THIS IS MAIN REASON FOR 4 ⭐️)3. Handset configured like conplex android even after having many in built apps but no app for lock apps and seems to be complex

"
"

  The camera pictures hv a yellow tinge which makes orange look like yellow and red look like orange. I returned the first phone thinking it might be a defective piece.but the second phone also had the same problem. I had almost returned the second phone also but then I figured out that the problem is not camera. Display setting had color correction mode on by default and it gave a yellow tinge to anything you see on phone screenIf you face the same problem pl go to your display setting or search color correction and put it off. The phone wl return to normal colorsI am using it for last 3 days and quite satisfied with the phone. Battery lasted 2 days but no games,music,videos. I am hoping battery performance wl improve in few daysCamera pictures are goodLots of bloatware come with Samsung so had to uninstall/ disable them manually

"
"

  use front cem iam not happy

"
"

  Display quality is good. But one thing which I don't like about the camera is that we can't use flash light when we take shots with 64 MP lens. Low light photographs are also not upto the mark. Rest everything is fine.

"
"

  I was using Redmi not 5 pro prior to this. I feel that phone was quite better than  this.Camara- though it mentions 64 MP camara but it failed to impress me. When we click using front camara it takes 2-3 seconds hold time before clicking  the picture. No flash for front camara.During operation  I didn't  find phone to be user friendlyThe most disappointing thing is time it takes for charging. They claim that it is super fast charging  but it is even slower than my note 5 pro. In 1 hr it charges something  around  25-30%......Design- Not at all attractive.. Doesn't  feel like new phone.Not at all recommend.  You may go go for Mi for realme.. I trusted Samsung  but eventually  it didn't  fulfilled  my expectations.

"
"

  Very bad mobile. Heating and hanging problem. Amazon not refunding even having mobile problem. Don't buy this mobile. Go for Redmi mobile. Camera  quality is  worst. Many thing's not  supported. Anyone want to take this mobile please let me know. Reduce some amount. Buy before 7 days. Only  battery is good other is worst. Samsung  must quit in making mobile.

  I Bought Samsung Galaxy M31 (Space Black, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage) really awesome mobile works quickly fast and secure, fingerprint reader fast. Mid range mobile with highly configuration, battery life no issues 2 days i am using even after internet browse and playing online games. Camera auality my review night camera photos i am not happy but in day time taken pictures really good. other than night camera pictures i don't face any issues till now.I recommended my my friends, Company Colleagues and family members to buy this product. Some of them have bought this product on my words they are really happy with this Samsung Galaxy M31 mobile.Thank you so much Samsung and team members who worked on this product for mid range people you guys are doing awesome.

"
"

  Cons:1. No notifications light.2. Large icons.3. No preinstalled app lock. You can install s secure to achieve that but lock symbols will be there on each locked app.4. Ringtone volume not so loud.5. No back cover provided.6. Camera is not that great as expected with 64mp.Pros:1. Screen quality2. Ram management3. Smooth performance4. Battery performance. After 12 hrs of usage, still having 60 % remaining battery (5 hours screen on time).5. Looks are pretty good.6. Samsung brand.

"

  First... I would like to express my experience of this mobile is tooooooo worst.... It's never performed like 6GB Ram Mobile.... It's working like 512kb ram ram mobile. And another great backdrop is it's bluetooth... It's connectivity does not meets at atleast basic phone... And another thing is it's speaker...This one also very poor.... Batter charging and backup also we can't compare with another brands in the present market... Because its took worst...I already requested to Amazon for return this phone, but, they smoothly refuesed my request as there is no chance to return as per their terms.Finally, my dear all who want to buy this product i strongly recommend that don't buy this mobile and don't waste your money...

"
"

  1.Camera - 3.8/52.Performance - 3.0/53.Battery backup - 2.7/5(Battery doesnot prove itself as 6000mah)Charge time is quiq agreed.But,drains fast.Feels like the capacity is 4000mah.My reivew im submitting after a week of observed usage.My major point on selecting this mobile was battery.........They assured 6000mah but the fact is i can just get 4000mah worthfullness.If ur just looking for 6000mah battery mobile this is the worst choice.Badly feel like cheated by samsung.

  Lets get straight to the ponit. If your main motive is to play graphic intensive games (pubg/cod/asphalt/etc.) then there is a back button for you on the top left. Though Samsung M31 is a very good phone, there are other phones in this price range which will just do better in gaming.But...Also read the rest• PERFORMANCEThe combination of M31 processor (Exynos9611) and it's operating system (One UI 2.0) will give you a level of performace where you'd think your device is a flagship phone. It is clean, fast, optimize, and just feels so premium in daily uses.• DISPLAYThe super Amoled display use in M31 and the display that Samsung used in thier flagship phones are same. It is just so eye pleasing and the colour production they are just amazing. You will not find any display equal to this in this price range.(If you dont mind the high refresh rate displays which does not have Amoled like M31)• BATTERY AND CHARGINGThe M31 got the highest amount of battery among all the phones that I've heard (including midrange and flagships). On many online reviews it's charging speed has been criticized by many reviewers. But after using it for a while I think they are kinda exaggerating. Because we barely let our phone battery die till we charge. In normal uses I charge when it is around 20-30% it gets fully charged within a hour and 45 minutes. Which is still surprisingly good considering the Battery size that we get.•CAMERACamera is the field in which the M31 shines amongst the other midrange competitors. The 64mp primary camera, the 8mp ultra wide, the 5mp depth sensor and the 5mp macro lens gives the perfect combination for the monster phone. Don't get fooled by the numbers in mega pixels because in the end it is how the device processes the pictures that matters the most. The Samsung M31 have particularly nailed those image processing.Meanwhile, the videos captured by these cameras are still above average they are not the best in this price range.*CONCLUSION*The Samsung M31 is one of the most overall balance phone in the midrange. In some devices when there is an upgrade in one field we needed to compromise with the other downgrade. Every phones have their pros and cons no matter what brand. But considering all these ups and downs M31 still makes a value for money purchase.Thank you..(If you have any question regardingthis device. You can always drop them on the comment)

  Update 1:- AI scene detection really enhances the colours and over all camera is quite commendable according to the price, if comparing to my OnePlus 7T. I also got a case from Amazon at just ₹59 which was unbelievable. Attaching Pictures for reference. Will update in near future if found anything worth updating.------------------------------------------------------Great Specs. Great Value. I got the 128 GB variant. Only single Con is that the Back Panel Scratches Very Easily. After unboxing the phone and using it for an hour or so I could see some minute scratches, so i would recommend to get a skin. Also if you're thinking there are no cases available in the market right now as this is a new product. It might take some time due to the outbreak of Coronavirus. Therefore I have applied a transparent skin.Also another thing the length of the charging cable is too short in my opinion.

"
"

  Disappointed  with Samsung, after many year I decided  to back to Samsung but  truly disappointed. Software performance is worst and heating issue. Camera performance is pathetic, Most Worst part of Amazon policy now you can't return at all, moreover not even replace easily,  you need to install the app then you will surprise  all the problems you face shall be found ok in the software. You will be in difficult situation,what to do?My strong recommendation not to go with Samsung M31.

"
"

  Dear Amazon Team,I have been delivered faulty product from UP. It is just 15 days from buying the product and it was showing hang issue. and now this phone is dead and restart itself. No customer care is replying. Very poor service. Need replacement of the phone immediately.

"
"

  Camara is too bad. Sound clarity is not at all good ... though it looks like a premium phone ,but when you started using it makes you feel that you bought a cheap quality product. Gets frequently stuck and restarts for no reason.

"

  Ordered Samsung Galaxy M31 within 5 minutes after sale starts. Really impressed by the quality of the camera. All 4 back cameras are working great. Wide angle feature is great. Live focus, Macro and Slow-motion features are awesome. Front camera is very good. It captures the photo very well in all types of lightning and background. Battery backup is good. 100% to 20% in around 30 hours with average usage. Screen resolution and touch is very good. Go for it if you have your budget less than 16k and looking for awesome camera and screen resolution.After 2 months usage: Battery charging takes more than 3 hours from 30% to 100% even though it shows Fast charging.  Battery is draining quickly when using mobile hotspot.Phone is heating too much. My kid is fearing to take my phone because of this heating issue (Don't know whether it is pros or cons 😜). Think before buying this phone.

"
"

  Apart from battrey and screen nothing is good. Front facing camera as per specs is of 32mp. But when u go for high resolution it show 21MP... TOTALLY CRAP. My samsung j7's 8mp is FAR MORE BETTER THAN this one in terms of front camera. FRAUD BY SAMSUNG.Finger prnt reader is not able to detect most of the times.

"
"

  Hi guys. Don't buy this product at all. Its battery performance  is very bad and it's taking more than 4-5 hrs to charginga and its getting complete in less than 1day eventhough we don't use much videos or games. Heating issue also there. Moreover,  I asked for replacement within 10 days itself but Amazon is keeping one useless mediating activity called phone inspection.  They will send some person who is not having any basic knowledge on phone or software and he do some nonsense. Technician means they should be professional  and they should carry some tools to test the phone. But nothing he iwas having. He simply reset my phone and starting checking charging properly or not. Means we should everytime reset our phone and charge and again have to reinstall or what. Very bad service by Amazon and the products they are selling are defective  pieces. Better buy directly from Samsung showroom or don't go for it at all. This is second time I am facing this issue. Samsung-it's a big flop to ur products

"
"

  Please be assure that u experience this phone once either with friends  or Samsung  shop it is a horrible  product  screen is yellow in color after trying  all the settings  it's one and the same  also the touch doesn't  work some time it get stuck or the phone get lock and also the display  has some with touches it automatically  open any app some times the whole problem is with screen and that's what ur going to use most of the time hence if really  u want a Samsung  phone just go and buy it offline  model this online only model are just a scam does not work well the first day it worked fine but as soon as I started using  it as my primary  device  issues  started coming  to me also the battery  has some issues  6000 mah battery  giving  4he of screen on time sometimes  even less then that that to in very low usage no game no videos I watch or play hope this helps u and still waiting  for technical to come and check my product he was supposed  to come today but yet not came and scheduled  for later very bad product and support.

"
"

  (After 2 months usage)The only advantage is AMOLED display.Performance of this phone is not at par.Battery is also disappointing as far as 6000 MAH is given, it only last a whole day.I was using 3500 mah phone earlier and that almost lasted same. Than 6000 mah should last too much longer than that, it's not optimised.Phone also gets heated sometimes even in normal usage (no games)Also build of the quality is not as standard for this range. It looks ok but actually cheap. The plastics make sounds when you feel it by fingers.Many scratches at back after 2 months usage.Material is just not very good.I did not find it fast enough for 6 GB RAM.Processor is slow. CALL DIALING, and normal features also run slow on this phone.Camera is also not very good.To sum it up, camera, battery ,performance is not up to standards and disappointing and only good id amoled display.

"
"

  Dear all pls don't pay this product. Over heating issue and slow charging time 5.30 hours in full charge over slow .and proper not working in sensor..so pls don't pay ..waste your money

"
"

  hi,I purchased this phone few days back. So far I am quite happy with the battery life. I had both JIO connections on VOLTE-ON and no WIFI, so on Mobile DATA this phone performs too good. Approx 20 hrs of usage on mobile data, 8 hrs ON in a corner where JIO signal is low. works like a charm.On WIFI, it says 100 even after 5 hrs with a usage of about 20+ min. this is also good.Definitely, Samsung bloatware apps, that you cant uninstall.However, I dont like the UI/Launcher. One of the worst looking icons. I hope samsung is reading this. 3 stars for this.Some MISSING features for this price and as everyone else is providing.1. LED Flash for missed messages/cals, etc2. LED flash for incoming calls3. Reminders & Goals missing in Calendar4. All the Apps are Samsung proprietary. Contacts, Calls, Messages, Calendar, etc5. Camera - Good in bright light or outside. not so good inside room even with good lighting. Seems like it needs high lighting

  Samsung M31 is the best ever mobile I found till now with ""6000 mAh"" monster battery, superb ""64 MP Quad Camera"", sAMOLED Amazing display, 6GB RAM and 128GB ROM, very quick fingerprint reader and many more. I personally feel this mobile is made for me and people who need great battery, camera and lots of space for storing as many documents or videos as we required. As I am a student, I have to watch lots of lecture in mobile for that everyone need good mobile battery which is not present in other mobile except Samsung M31 with an student friendly budget. It's unbelieveable that I have a mobile with wonderful features within Rs. 15,999 only, no other company given so many things. This making me forever customer of Samsung, I am really very thankful to Samsung team for designing such an amazing mobile for us. Although most of the company send earphone with there mobile, Samsung hadn't delivered till now. It is sad because I have to use local earphone with an amazing Samsung M31 mobile.

  Using it for 4 days now. The mobile has few pros and cons.Pros-Camera is Highlight of this phoneAmazing Battery BackupBeautiful ScreenWidevine L1 and Dolby AtmosClean and Professional One UI - graphics are really cool and has really nice featuresNo lags as of now.Cons-No Stabilization for 4K video recordingDesign is not that greatNot recommended for games.Will update the review after using it extensively.

  Very bed bettery backup

  A great piece for a great price. This phone is for the people who want a phone from a premium  brand with sAmoled display , great set of cameras, decent processor AND THE BEST: VERY LOW SAR VALUE.. I don't use the phone for gaming , it's only for Day to day use and media consumption. It's great to watch full HD movies on a fhd+ super crisp super amoled display. A great 64MP camera that takes great shots.. The wide angle is just amazing compared to any competitors in the price segment.. The massive 6000mAh battery lasts more than any phone I have used before and the fast charger is decent enough to charge this massive battery within 2 hours from 0% ..So I guess this is the best budget phone.

"
"

  Hi all - whoever planning to buy M31 please don't its having a serious display issue showing lite pink and when we rotating less then 1 inch in any dimension its showing exact color otherwise direct view showing pink ..half showing one color half display in another color. They are not taking return for this product. Used Samsung before but now thinking never to buy anymore. I want return or replacement from amazon

"
"

  Worst battery..its takes 2.5-3 hours to fully charge may be 3.3 hours. Battery life okay. offen hands while scrolling WhatsApp of Instagram. Screen gets black out every day for 5- 10 seconds.Camera is good.M series in total not good..earlier bought m20 got sick in 12 days company says not replacement , service service also repaired  but it got hanging problem again now m20 is in useless.

  After using one week i have these experience with Samsung Galaxy M31.Pros: Attractive design.Screen size is handy at 6.4 inch.Good camera,both selfie and main at 32mp and 64 mp.Cons:Phone is heating very much.It heats always when charging,gaming and using internet.Charging is very slow.Even it is having 6000 mah battery, it drains very fast.In standby position also it comes from 100% to 80% overnight.Very disappointing.If this is fixed after any updates I will update my review.After two weeks of usage I am updating.After writing to Samsung members they suggested me some changes in settings.Now my mobile performing well.After 2 months, again I am adding.After updating two times no heating issue.Battery lasts for two days even after full day use.Satisfied.

"
"

  Bad ever phone I have buy now going to return it back .... in YouTube channels  10hrs continue battery but in reality poor battery performance once you play a game it reduce up to 30percent battery every bad performance.... camera quality that shown by youtubers in reality 64MP doesn't  evn give its 40percent....poor fake quality  display of Samsung and I was always right about it ....

"
"

  Sorry but this time Amazon and Samsung really disappointed me.I have bought samsung m30 and m30 S earlier from Amazon and it was really a Goood great deal. But this time it was very disappointing and shameful. I bought m31 megamonster for my soulmate but she really got disappointed with phone and it was really hurting for me.Poor camera quality like a 2 megapixel cameraNot 64mpPoor battery like 3500mAh not 6000mAhDON'T BUY M31 U CAN GO FOR M30S. SORRY SAMSUNG

"
"

  I was really excited for this phone. Ordered on the 5th of march and got it on the 6th. So far loved it and here's my review.My first impression was the weight being so good for a 6000mah battery phone. Also the display is excellent and every movie buff will love this. It also has Dolby Atmos sound.The rear camera is phenomenal (see pics). Getting a 64 MP camera inThe AI is what makes it stand out and the colours really pop out beautifully. The selfie camera (32 MP) is also good it doesnt have a flash but the screen flash does the job.Played pes (1.6 GB football multiplayer game) on it and it works very well. I haven't faced any lags in it so far. And the samsung UI like the notification bar, icons and settings is also easy to use and gives a premium effect.So here are the pros and consPROS:- Price- Camera- Battery- Display- Storage and it also has a dedicated memory card slot.CONS:- Back design could have been better. But i use a separate cover so it doesn't make difference to me.- Charging could be fasterFinal thoughts- This phone is ideal for anyone looking for a good battery and camera in their phone. The price still astounds me and samsung has really outdone itself.

"
"

  I bought this phone as soon as it was launched, a month ago after my Galaxy S10 was stolen. I needed another phone but couldn't afford to get another expensive device after just losing one. When I read the specs for the M31 128GB (which seemed unreal) I decided to give it a shot. For the price, it's honestly a steal! Great battery life, awesome camera and pretty good aesthetic appeal too.What of course I'm disappointed in is that I've needed to reboot it several times due to the phone hanging or app failures and a couple of times it just rebooted on its own... The response is jerky at times (nothing in the league of the S series). But then, at this price, that's really not a fair comparison.So if you're looking for a monster that's pocket friendly - this is the BAAP. I would have just liked it slightly smaller in size so it fit pockets and arm bands easily... But that's me.

  Out of all phones under 15k, it has the lowest SAR value (radiation levels).Now a days most of the marketing strategy is around adding RAM, Storage and Camera. How well the Hardware and it's performance is optimised and integrated with motherboard and OS clearly shows the difference in using these phones.Else all phones should work same provided it all has similar spec and hardwareFinally decided to buy this model after multiple reviews and device comparison of phones under 15k of all top brands.Infact my first samsung phone.While configuration, received security patch and UI updatesFrom user experience from Lenovo, Redmi, Azus, Samsung seems to be incomparable with those brands.Since the frameless case in yet to be delivered, using it very carefullySuper happy user since 3days. No complaints or regret on buying the phone.

"
"

  Very poor quality, phone touch stopped responding on few areas suddenly. Didn't expected this from Samsung. I am not able to use from a month.. :(Tried connecting customer service and they asked to go service center when it opens after lockdown. On asking whether my warranty period would be extended due to this, they completely denied.. I am feeling cheated now. :((Don't buy this phone !!

  Samsung has created enough hype, got in many stars and YouTube reviewers to sing loud praises of this product. There is enough positive data out there, so I will not repeat that.This is undoubtedly one of the best mid-rangers out there. But with few glaring shortcomings. From minor to major flaws:First thing to note is the back panel, which is prone to scratches and smudges. Samsung could have provided a case or have made arrangements to ship both the device and some selection of cases together. I didn't see many. This phone needs a case. period.Second is the camera. while it is good, with heavy post processing to get the right results. You can reproduce some of the advertised samples with the help of a tripod. But day-to-day shots will be still at 80% mark. No complaints for the price paid though.Third and one of the worst offenders no one ever spoke of is the phone antenna. I have never seen a samsung with such pathetic antenna. Pair that with poor software. Signal is always 33% more attenuated compared to other phones: I have an older Nokia 8: M31 always has 2 bars less signal strength at the same place with same operator. Slips to 2G very easily. Calls are frequently cracking due to bad signal reception. And the software keeps forgetting my preferred network mode: Airtel on LTE auto and BSNL on 3G only. The moment I exit the setting app, it resets everything to LTE auto and the auto downgrade to 2G continues.If you work or live in a place with even 50% signal on your current phones, be warned that this phone will add to your woes by simply not connecting. Antenna design is not something new that had to be completely reinvented for this phone, nor does it involve very expensive materials. Yet Samsung has screwed up in one primary function: How will you watch FHD+ videos if signal and speeds are pathetic because someone screwed up a basic function?

  Poor camera and display quality. Its not a 64 MP camera it's  quality is like 8 MP camera. Flash is not working in 64 MP ratio.And Amazon is also not returning this item. Vivo gives more quality in this price range. Now a days Samsung is selling it's name only not quality. Don't buy this.

  Hello all,Here I am writing the review of the product after using 20 days, this mobile given the most worst experience.After using 20 days the display is not working, It has stopped working while I am using the mobile.And the Call quality also worst.Unable to connect the calls, every time we have to restart to call some one.Samsung service is also a given worst experience.No one will respond for your issue.No authorized centers will pickup the call and respond to your Query.My suggestions for the new buyers is don't go with this product.Thank you.

  Camera quality is not good as it mentioned in specification (64MP).Mobile phone gets hanged sometimes.Battery back up is good.Facilities and other fitures are not good as compared to other brand mobiles in same prize.

"
"

  There are lots of negative review which led me to confusion before buying this, but this phone is worth the price.Display- awesome, colors , touch rsponse...all good.Battery- long backup, even if u play games. Around 14 hrs display time (medium usage)Charging - a bit slow, takes 2 hrs from 25 to 100Camera- good color production,  decent picture quality (not a sony sensor, so don't expect that quality), macro is nice. Selfie (both angle) decent. Overall for day to day usage it's very good. But not for pro shooters.Processor- thought it would be the biggest drawback, but it is not, pubg and asphault runs well in smooth(not hdr)Overall i will recommend this phone to all who use phone for day to day usage(no hardcore gaming but big games with casual setting will run well), love to support made in india products.Thank you.

  I spend my first salary on the first day of the online launch and I am happy to have a good phone on the next day at my doorstep with all the features that I would like to on my phone.So here are Pros:6000 mAh Battery64MP Quad Rear camera32 MP Front Camera6GB RamFast chargingSmooth Touch displayPop-up view featureAndroid 104K video recordingFastest face unlock

"

  Camera is not as expected. Its garunteed not 64MP the way it takes pictures. Ofcourse the colors in the pictures are awesome however, if we try to zoom even slightly it doesnt show clearly. Night mode is also not as expected it gives blurr images. I am disappointed with the camera as camera was the sole reason I took this phone. Front camera is as usual with full of beauty effects which I hate. Otherwise, speaking about its other features such as battery, looks and feel, Display, etc it is pretty well with this price. Although the plastic feels kinda cheap but its ok.

"
"

  I don't know this issue for all M31 devices or only my device. Camera quality is very very very bad.. If you do little zoom, you can see black lines are coming and going..If you record video, more than 30 minutes..getting message ""camera not responding message""...Not happy with the audio

"

  I thought this may be great replacement of my S9 Plus and it proved me wrong...This is just an average phone with 64 mega pixel and that's it.....very poor performance if you install any apps more than 100 for a 128 GB phone.  The S9 plus can work seamlessly with 150 apps installed without any performance issues except the battery life.Pros:------>> no need to buy camera and use it as a camera.>> Good battery backup>> Selfie Camera is good with 32 mega pixel.Cons:------>> Just a toy phone for someone wants to play with camera.>> we need to look at the processor not just the camera quality.  I set up my office outlook and all other applications in this phone and it just gets struck ever 15 minutes and doesn't even close for 1 min almost.>> This phone with 128 GB is really waste as the processor can't handle that much memory.>> This may be good in videos quality but the poor options while capturing the camera (No Auto Focus).>> Worst face reading technology -- even after face unlock you still need to swipe up, and it sucks...!!!>> The charger that comes with this phone is a garbage it takes 3-4 hours to fully charge this phone.>> This phone is not water proof at all.  If you pour one drop on this phone, your screen touch will stop working.>> The speaker is very low and hardly you can hear when you put a hard case over the phone.>> My phone screen got damaged and not sure where can I get this replaced as there is no insurance for screen flickering issues.Conclusion:-------------An average model phone with 64 mp camera (I don't see any big difference with S9 plus camera features).  Needs a lot of improvement on the processor side and can't be compared with Snapdragon processors.

  1) From 0 to 100% taking more than 2 hours.2) Battery consuption is high due to default SAMSUNG apps which cannot be deleted and also reducing performance.3) Not possible to Delete NETFLIX4) Even if you download any app from Samsung store you have to upgrade it through Google Play Store, better to directly download latest updated version from Google Play Store directly5) Available RAM for use is only 3.2 GB due to too many unnecessary SAMSUNG APPS are not allowed to uninstall.It was my first and last mobile of NON STOCK ANDROID mobile, earlier used 5 stock android mobiles out of 6 gb RAM it provided 4.8 GB availablity and all non required apps can be deleted so purchasiñg ""Stock android"" mobile is only good option if want to purchase Android mobileDear Samsung - It was not your fault, I wasnt aware that purchasing NON Stock android will have additional mandatory apps of your company, Can you push OTA update for my device and make it stock android?

  I bought Samsung M31 (6gb,128gb model) 20 days back. First time my hate for samsung reached to peaks.  I made this purchase by keeping following factors :1. Brand - Samsung2.  Released in March 2020  (Felt latest model)3.  Specs are good enough for budget price of 17k.4,  Cam specs4.  Not to a pick a Chinese product.But friends i am telling you who are having above thoughts you make like M31 but dont go for it. Because here are con's :1. While speaking over the phone, Its going to hold even though there is no touch to screen while speaking.2. Even though i haven't enabled call recording, few calls are getting recorded automatically.3. Worst thing, If you upload a pick to Watsapp status your picture quality goes worst.4. For full charging it will take 3 hours. Not used my phone extensively it gave charging for 1.5 day.5. Vedio recording image stabilization - Worst.Then i started googling about unstability of this phone, There was an update for samsung M31 in April which made phone to unstable. Do research and take reviews from the people who are using the phone then go for a better option.I will write above cons to samsung. Please dont waste your money. 10 days replacement only - If someone bought already do thorough checks and replace the phone.

  Weak signal antenna...Flash and wide angle camera don't work with 64MP camera..battery performance don't look like 6000mh. Both front and rear camera quality is bad...making false advertisement on camera and battery performance...don't think you are getting quality features in Rs.16000..if you buy it you are big fool..

"

  I can't believe within a month the phone screen started showing lines.19/05/2020 May Update: Went to the service center in Delhi and the lady and the manager said I'd need to pay if anything is broken. What's the warranty for? I asked what's the ""Gorilla Glass"" for if it couldn't handle a pocket fall (which is what they said happened)? And their reply, ""We are insiders. So we understand these things, there's no such thing as ""gorilla vorilla"" it's a normal mirror. If it falls and breaks then you'll have to pay for this.""I can't believe Samsung has been making a fool of us all these years. Can anyone else confirm this ""insider"" info? Meanwhile, the rest of you should keep this in a bank locker.

  As per commitment of the samsung about this  this m31 is worth less camera quality is very bad.Other calling aap not supported.Can't dial the WhatsApp and other call directly from contact.After 4-5 apps open the phone performance is really slow.Charging of the phone is really slow it takes 3 hours to full charge.. samsung cheated us.

"

  It's really amazing product...smooth operations...huge battery backup...premium look....feel is superb..... (first 5 days)ButCamera quality expectations are fully embarasing. Camera wise it makes mood off.I waited for this handset, purchased after long wait....performance is superb..but quality of camera is so so....One more problem noticed-Hangs too much,Can't shut off,can't reboot,Voice calling hanged,No voice during calls, just mute..Slowwwwww,It shows UI error..Totally disappointed...Requested for refund/replace...waiting for good one.

"

  I have been using the phone for the past 2 month now. The battery life is a sham!! 6000mah does not even last for a day and the phone becomes very hot very easily, and the calls disconnect or the phone restarts at its will. The WiFi calling does not work at least 40% of the time!! It is filled with a ton of benefits but the main reason anyone would ever buy this phone is for the battery and that is not true as advertised. One WiFi video call of 2 hours drains at-least 40% of the battery!! My battery stays for only one day, I got better battery life with my old phone of 5000mah...could do almost 48 hours without any charge. Now I'm stuck with this!! Please test the battery and return it immediately if there is a fault, don't do what I did, which is 'I adjusted'!

  sir, I  purchased the mobile with much excitement that it would provide a wonderful experience but actually the product is not worth purchasing. After using the phone for 3 to 4 weeks the system asked for an update of the software but as soon as I downloaded the update and installed it. My mobile crashed and I can do nothing on the phone. It is neither getting switched off nor restarted. So what type of help you can provide me in this regard. I will be waiting for your reply as a customer.

"
"

  First of all, my first review was deleted by amazon, saying its manipulating the context and feature of product..This is a review section so i can give my honest review but amazon is deleting it thats dumb.. If u dont need reviews than block it for all. Why would u only keep only positive reviews and delete any negative points????Here is the thing- battry is not uoto mark.. It drains quickly.. And it takes more than 2.5 hrs say 3 hrs as per my personal experience.Camera is good.Battery is a nightmare if u want to keep it charging after every 2 hrs than go ahead .and last time i gave 2 stars.. But u deleted the comment so this time take the 1 star for the product.. Coz its really a peice of shirt. You know twhat i mean 😂😂😂😆

  Purchased this phone on the 1st day of launch i.e. 5th March 2020; 12:00 PM. After using more than a week, reviewing the phone on 14th March 2020; 5:15 PM. I hope you will find it helpful.*Camera:Rear Camera has few mode/frames. Out of which it's fixed 3:4 (64 mp) has great picture quality. Other modes/frame like 3:4, 9:16, 1:1, full can capture good quality pics as long as you do not zoom it. Video quality is also good but could be better.Front camera 32 mp is also fine. You will get delicately balanced picture quality.* 6.4 inches phone feels bit large and heavy while handling and keeping in pockets.* Battery (6000mAH): It stood on its ground. Surely have high battery backup. Did few experiments and here's the result:--> Around 50 hrs on standby mode with normal use for calling and checking messages (Wifi was active during those hours and background apps were running)--> 11-12 hrs of continuous usage for gaming--> 18-20 hrs of continuous video playing over wifi (not sure for mobile network)Disclaimer: These hours may vary as per individual use and environment. I'm sharing the details as per my own usage.* Exynos 9611 Octa core processor: Samsung is surely working hard with providing improved versions of its processor. The processor speed with the combination of Android v10 is great. I didn't find any heating issue even while playing high end graphic games. The RAM wasn't even getting used completely. However, if we compare this processor with Snapdragon, I can say that this processor is equivalent to Snapdragon 700 series.* Face unlock and fingerprint sensor: Company claims that the phone has fast face unlock and fingerprint sensor. However, I didn't find that true. For face unlock, the phone takes 2-3 sec time to detect the face.* Phone comes with Dual SIM (nano+nano) facility but with dual standby. Both SIMs aren't active simultaneously.* Both Charging slot and 3.5mm jack for earphones are placed at same end (bottom side), which I personally didn't like (That is one of the reason I rate it 4 star).* There are other internal features as well which one person might like and another might not. Example: Wifi Calling support, Blue light filter, smart view, ultra data saving mode, Dulby Atmos, Dark Mode etc...--> Dulby Atmos function work while you plug in the ear-phones (I personally didn't find it that good. Sound quality seems similar)--> Personally love the Dark Mode.Overall, the Smartphone is great. If you want to purchase a smartphone within this range, you may go ahead with this one.

  Gorilla glass 3Its very worst fregile product. Fall ones by 5 inch and broken glass.I have Samsung Galaxy m31 i buy before 2 months.  But till i full reset my phone after that my fast charging  not working. I used already  another charger and cable  but its not workin also. I used power off mode also but it's not working.  So friends  there is no support to how to do use fast charging.  Please don't buy Samsung M series. AND after 3 months NOW comes new update fast charging is worked. 16 jun 2020 .Thank You

  The phone is very amazing it's more than expectation. I ordered black version with 6GB of ram and 128 GB space. Best smartphone in this segment price. The trump card  of this phone is camera. What a wide angle and selfie  captured by this phone amazingly good..  all the best feature you will get on this price.

  This is the Galaxy M31 review after a week use.Bought this phone to replace my existing iPhone SE after watching so many videos of tech reviews which are continuously bashing Apple for providing low specs mobiles. After a week, I realised that I made severe mistake by acknowledging their words. The 64 MP camera is nowhere near my 4 year old iPhone’s 12 MP camera. Macro camera is another joke in this package.Performance:  Galaxy M31 has ‘so called’ 6 GB RAM but works like 100MB RAM device. 3 GB RAM will always be occupied and you can’t do anything about that. Say what, you are free to use 3 GB RAM only. Even my Windows 10 OS use only 1.5 GB RAM. And even my older Moto E ( yes, Moto E) works better than this phone in scrolling through internet. About gaming, it’s bad joke. My 4 years old iPhone SE runs seamlessly even in 2GB RAM.Tech people always boast about Android that it’s customisable. What customisation would serve if your phone is not even working properly? You aren’t even allowed to uninstall Netflix and they keep talking about customisations.Battery life is pretty good though. At least they did good in this case. 6000mAh lives for 1.5 to 2 days in normal use.Another feature provided with this phone is heating. Just some normal activities will heat up your Galaxy M31 so much that you can pretty much use it as heater in winters. Not joking here.I bought 64 GB variant, and only 47 GB was usable. Android system is taking 13-14 GB in the system. Really?Overall, not happy with purchase. Waste of 16.5K with this garbage product.Samsung, you can so way better than this!!

  From the user of Samsung Guru 1200, Metro duos C3322, Mertro XL, Galaxy On5 Pro to this Galaxy M31 & going to use Note series after some months & as a Samsung fan I'm honestly writing this review. This is a Decent phone at this price. Most of the time the Fingerprint reader unable to unlock the phone. This type of camera quality isn't expected from 64MP, f1.8 camera sensor. Macro camera, selfie camera, wide angle camera okay. In this phone, you can't choose ringtone from external memory or even phone memory and Samsung should give the internet speed notification, daily usage on the notification bar like other mobile phone to compete in this type of small matter, without giving that Glance, Discover etc option. Samsung should change this from next update to become more popular like other phone. Touchscreen is too much sensitive but this sAMOLED screen is just superb, awesome and 6000mAh battery will give you a long lasting usage after one full charge. Otherwise it's an all in one phone.The new problem which I'm facing now(after using it 2 months) is, if the data connection is on with 1st SIM and at that time if any SMS comes to 2nd SIM then the data connection get lost fully until I active the airplane mode & then deactivate it. It makes a lot of problem during banking transactions with OTPs.

  Very bad product. There are so many issue.1. Heating during using the phone. Like camera phone calls in 2-5 mins.2. Poor front camera quality. Like 8 MP camera.3. Sound is also not good.4. Taking more than 3 hours to charge full. And 6000mah batter is giving one day backup.full fake.Totally fake phone by Samsung. Requesting Amazon to don't sell this kind of fake phone. Samsung  are fooling the amezon customer.Don't buy.

  As consider price point galaxy m31 is very high in price because of the performance, camera quality, processor and design wise its very dull and boring in real life and also heatup very quickly when Playing games. And one more thing in galaxy m31 also have ads like redmi, realme, oppo and vivo. Samsung simply cheat you and looting you.I must said please don't waste your money on waste galaxy m31 because at this price you have very better option available in market. Samsung also leak and stole our data as like other companies so their is no difference between Chinese company and Samsung. If you not agree with me than just read carefully user agreement, terms and user policy of Samsung.

  It is not 10 days that i have got this phone. But having issues in hearing some one talk from the other side or at times, the other person on the call cannot hear you. it is clear that the microphone are bad and not serving the purpose of a phone. When you play music, you can see that the volume of the song just fading off and at a point you just cannot hear any noise from the phone.When I try to return the phone its asking to install a smart check app and only if the app says there is some defect, they would take the phone back. If the result come positive they say the phone cannot be returned and we need to talk to the manufacturers.Total waste of money.. now that I have to live with this noise less phone until i get another one.And another point to note is that, I trusted that I would be happy with this phone, hence had purchased a special phone cover. now that money is also a waste.

  Over heating issue and slow charging time 5 hours in full charge over slow .and proper not working in sensor..so pls don't pay ..waste your money

  The phone looks and feels good in the hand. All the gimmicks while setting up the phone would make one feel happy about buying the phone. Now let's get to the tall claims by Samsung basis which one has spent 17K.First of all I received a phone which when switched on went directly to system reboot mode. That was the first shock! The others are described next.Finger print reader is slow at times and one has to place the finger a couple of times to unlock the phone.Battery Life is lower than a 3000mah. Yes, one would get a longer battery life out of this phone if left unused and that is precisely what it hasn't been purchased for.Camera Quality is bad, very bad. The pictures are so grainy and pixelated. Had a Moto G4 plus before this and the picture quality from the camera was awesome.Feel cheated by Samsung for palming off such poor quality device for INR 17K. I want a refund.Amazon, I am aware that this review will go through a review by your team. Please take note and help initiate a return and refund so that I can buy a better device worth its value. Tganks!

  Awesome  screen .Awesome battery  .Awesome  cameras .Specially  ... one UI 2.0 of Samsung  is superb. I used Samsung  Galaxy  alot but for 2-3yrs i was on moto and others ... but being  back to Samsung ... it's  worth it .Go for it ... the screen is just min blowing  at this price . No one can beat it .Also .. I don't  play any games ... but i read alot and watch plenty of movies ...but being  an experienced  smartphone  user i can tell ... it can run any game without  lag .. with 6 gb + exynos 9611 processors (if I'm  ri8) . Same as A51 which cost 24k .Just go for it .1 thing is plastic body ... but body is also very good ... not like previous  plastic  Samsung  ... it's  glossy ... but any way we are gonna use back case  ... so it doesn't matter  anyway .1 thing - Biometric  take some time to get use to i guess.It's  a large device ... side fingerprint  would have been best .And face unlock  take some time ..... face unlock is not that good i would say . But may be due to extra security  .. we have to make sure of correct  angle and light  .

  I used to be a Samsung customer long back but had switched to Chinese brands which have dominated the market for quite some time now. It is very refreshing to see Samsung again giving competition to these brands in 15-20k segment.This phone is certainly a testimony to the resurgence of Samsung in this price bracket.Now coming to the phone :Pros :-1. Battery : This has to be the single largest plus point of this phone. At 6000mah, Its battery is a monster and it was the prime reason i bought this model rather than the other chinese brands which barely last a day on a full recharge. On the other hand, this battery easily lasts 1.5 - 2 days in normal usage and more than a day in heavy usage.2. Dedicated memory slot (2+1) : This is another big plus of this model that you get a dedicated slot for memory card.3. Screen Quality - It is FHD+ screen with nice and smooth colors. There is no lag and it feels fluidic. Where it scores over other brands is that Samsung offers Super Amoled screen whereas other brands have LCD capacitive touch screen. Though there is not a huge difference between the two but you do get a premium feel while using this one.4. Camera - Again it is good at 64mp and the zoom out feature works like a charm. Also, there is no lag whatsoever while clicking heavy pics at full resolution. Front facing camera is good as well and stands at 32mp. No lag in clicking front photos as well.5. Size : It is not that huge and you can use it with a single hand.6. Memory : 6gb Ram and 128 gb memory is more than sufficient. Plus, the dedicated memory slot is a huge add-on.Other conviniences include - Type C charging port and fast charging support and 3.5mm audio jack.Now coming to the cons. Not many but a couple i definitely noticed :1. Fingerprint Sensor : It is not just bad but very bad (and I mean it). Very unresponsive and erratic. I mean you have to wait for a couple of seconds for it to respond after placing your finger. And it may sometimes glitch as well. So, you need to retry.2. Charging cable : Extremely short length at 1 feet or so which renders it quite useless. Length is very insufficient.3. Charger : It is a standard 5v-2A charger. They could have provides a bigger one given that phone supports quick charging.Overall if you take a look at the price (15k) , it is an awesome buy. Apart from the Fingerprint sensor, I found everything in the phone to be top-notch. The specs at this price might be arguably comparable to other phones in this range but the battery backup makes buying this phone a no-brainer. Would definitely recommend this anytime :)

  Battery is very poor. It is draining at a rate of 6% per hour. I didn't expect such a poor product from samsung. Moreover, while charging for even half n hour phone heated up. It restarted by it's own after following troubleshoot procedure also.

  I was using Samsung J2 earlier,  excellent phone,  later shifted to moto X4....after long time switching again to Samsung after hearing the success of M30s. Little disappointed. It's an average mobile phone.1.The finish of the phone is below average. If we use this mobile without back cover,  please will judge that this guy is using cheap Mobile,  I am covering it up with spigen cover now. It is not even like Samsung J2 mobile. Poor plastic.(ABS).2. CAMERA,  I use to take lot of mobile photographs  it's my hobby,  I don't see any difference in this megapixel and 3 or 4 camera's....if you are better cameraman, single camera is enough,  since it is with 4 camera we try to take different pictures,  camera okay. Lot of night in low light. Macro is 5 MP, no clear picture....3. Reception of Mobil signal, I felt slightly weak,  when I compare with motoX4, I was using it for nearly 2 years, now with M31s, I am not getting proper data connectivity inside home. Further I have to check...4. Mobile phone is mobile slightly heating up, not like mi,  but it is not like earlier Samsung.5. Battery it mega but last for one complete day, there is ko need to search charger in the evening,  but we need to charge it in the night, the charging time is long since the battery 6000mah. There will be possibilities of partial charging of battery, which may reduce the life of battery.Samsung could have done better, looks like urgently cooked

  So this is my edit review after using not more than 3months.. It has discolouration issue.. No any external force applied neither contact of water.. It happend when my phone's battery death and I plugged in with charger after then I putted off and I saw discolouration sudden..It started right bottom to top with pink and purple shade nd quickly spread overall display..And when I visited service center they directly denied to repair as told that it's not under in warranty.... Nd I'll have to bear that cost with Rs of 5000 to 6000 for change the display.. When I already spent 17000 Rs. to purchased new phone..DISGUSTING....And I believe that everyone keep their phone safely when atleast phone is new and expensive..I feel just regret about my decision and mistake I made to purchased this worst compny phone..But I surprised how Samsung play the scam game with their valuable customersNow I believe that Samsung is just fraud and fake and it's scam nd make fool to their customers in name of the warranty.I recommend to all Amazon buddies pls pls pls 🙏 don't go with Samsung Phone if you don't wanna waste your hard earn and valuable money....

  Pros:1. Display is good especially dark images or videos look great2. Really a monstrous battery3. Selfie camera is better4. Fingerprint sensor is fast5. OS is fluidic without any lag6. Call quality and reception is good7. No ads and the default Apps can be deletedNeutral:1. External speaker volume is decent but not great. Would be great if they provide stereo speakers like in the NokiasCons:1. Primary Camera is decent but not great. 64 MP is just a number on paper. My 16 MP LG V20 camera takes better photos.2. Phone is little heavyConclusion:If you don't want Redmi Note series phones then this is the best branded alternative at this price point

  1.Good Camera but produces Noise in Indoor Lighting Conditions Could be Fixable through an OTA Update.2.Very Good Battery Life.3.Good Display but lacks HDR 10 support.4.Processor Gives Average performance compare to Qualcomm Snapdragon Processors but its sufficient for Normal People Who don't play Heavy Graphics Related Games.5.Physical Fingerprint Scanner is Quite Fast But An In Display Fingerprint Scanner Would Give Better Experience On This Smartphone.6.Software on this device is Smooth like a Butter and Packs Some Really Good Features but Real-time Network Speed Option Should Have Been Provided For Better Experience On This Device.Maybe Samsung Could provide this feature thought OTA Update Later On.7.This Phone Comes with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 but They should Provided Corning Gorilla glass 5 as other brands are providing in this price range.

  Heating issuesLagging issuesNetwork issues these are the main problems of samsung phones..we dont need a monster battery or camera /SAMOLED display,. just need a basic performance

"
"

  Camera quality is not at all good..the sharpness of the images is very poor...also does not work good in low light condition. It does not look like Samsung.The overall experience is not at all good. Other phones in the range give better quality.

  Purchased Samsung M31 on sale date and got delivered the very next day. As soon as i opened  the box i was disappointed  as there is no Screen protector or Mobile case available. Box has only mobile phone , type c cable and charger only. Phone was charged to 73%.Now , i have been using it for past few days and i have mixed reviews about it.Display of this phone is very good and one can easily differentiate between anyother company and samung's super Amoled.Camera seems to be okayish.. it's  not that great but UI of samsung is very smooth.Batterylife is also decent compared to 6000mah.My opinion is it will be a decent buy for 15k but dont expect too much from it.

"
"

   Live focus Camera is too goodBattery is great which lasts for a day.Display is nice and Bigger great for watching video and playing games.Fingerprint scanner is little bit slow.Face detection also slow.But in 16 k it is value for money.

   The Amazon tamper proof packaging & timely delivery is always worth a thumbs up.The product was delivered without any issue, but after unboxing, when I wanted to switch it on, it just wouldn't. I was expecting the phone to have some juice, at least 20-30% battery, but it was not so. When I connected it to the charger, the battery level was 0%. So I charged to 20% and then switched it on..and it actually started in the recovery mode, instead of normal boot. And that was a surprise..but then I could boot it normally.After this initial scare, the setup was normal and smooth.I like the look & feel of the product, and as compared to my earlier Moto One Power, it is way lighter even with a 6000 mah battery. But I do have a feeling, Snapdragon is a bit smoother than Exynos.Overall for me, after two days of usage, I am satisfied with the performance. The camera output, both front & rear, are really good, though I have not used all the modes yet.For me, the most useful features are the in-built call recording facility and the always on feature (I though always on was only available with Motorola).In short, I would say, it is a value for money device.I purchased the phone in March 2020, and by end of July 2020, I have received 2 security and feature updates.I have used the camera in the last 5 months. The results are very satisfactory. There may be some limitations in low light photography, but with a little tweaking, you get good results.

  I saved money for 5 months and bought this phone about 25 days ago. First thing is you cant replace it after these days and now it is getting restarted in-between  i am working on it. Not just that , it does not turn on but only the samsung logo shows for 1-2 hours. Now you cant do anything. I went to service center . They kept this phone for 3 days and did nothing . They said to me to pick up my phone after all the data has been deleted and phone's has been reset . And the very next day , here I am with this same problem . I am regretting a lot with samsung . And cant just go to service center daily. Its 50 km far from my residence.

"
"

  II am writing this with 4 months of usage.Issue1: Getting On-Hold automatically during calls.Issue2: Call recording also autmatically ON during calls even we dont need.Issue3: Sensors are very bad, not able to recognize call is going or not.Issue4: Camera stabilization is very bad, not able to take photo of scan docs perfectly, always it used to be blurred.Issue5: Charging time is more, even though they are telling 15w charge. My old phone get charged quickly rather than this.When i tried to reach customer care toll free, there is no response from them saying ""Limited staff"". Think before buying this model twice.

"
"

  Very very disappointed about the quality of the product...used only for 10 days...then a black spot started appearing in the back camera..visited Samsung Garia service centre.They denied to replace the product as I have purchased it online..However they took my complain and advised that they will change the camera but that is a time consuming matter.really disappointed after investing hard earned money in Samsung...very very poor quality product..

"
"

  Bought phone on May 21 and Screen broke on June 21. Customer care while e-mailed said that it is covered under warranty- Service Centre denied to replace screen, asking for 5k Plus taxes. Why should anyone buy a product that has NO GUARANTEE? Is this the service of the product?

"
"

  NEVER BUY SAMSUNG. HORRIBLE PHONE.If you're a power user. 5+hre of screen time. Movies, calls, emails.This BRICK is not for you.-very heavy- slow camera- slow processing- Poor UI- Very very poor battery- 3hrs+ charging time- A charging cable 18"" inches. Really!!? what kind of cost saving was this!!- very heavyI still cant believe i trusted Samsung for this phone...M31 is really sad.

"
"

  I have noticed below issues with phone.* camera: it cuts photo frame in ouput photo due to this u do not get actual image of what seen on screen, it cut about a inch from sides.* battery: takes tooooo long to charge if phone is made on charging at 20% than it takes 3 hours to reach in nineties that too if no other work is done and phone is kept idle.Also battery drains out easily* Heating issue: phone is getting hot at charging time, regular use of data. And not only back screen too gets hot considerably.While video calling pop up comes that whatsapp is making phone hot, close whatsapp otherwise will close in 20 sec.

"
"

  After complainingSame issue of reboot doesn't solvedLoud speaker quality is very poorSound output is extremely lowOn full volume too....

"
"

  Battry is not good only half day run and camera is very poor.  Built quality is bad . Back Is made plastic body . And not suport to fast charging and I receive this phone without charger . Charger is missing in the box .  total west of money

  I have a Samsung M31SYMPTOMSa) all videos regardless of the application used are playing on fastforward with no sound. This happens on all apps incl youtube, netflix, amazon prime, including videos I have been sent via WhatsApp. b) there is no sound on the phone at all - nothing when I play music, it doesn't ring when someone calls me, and even though i can pick up the call, I can't hear the other person's voice and they cant hear mine ATTEMPTED FIXES THAT DID NOT WORK1. Restart multiple times2. Reset app preferences3. Play with Dolby settings (restore to default, turn off/on)4. Wipe cache preferences using volume up/down buttons then rebooting5. Adjusting all the volume settings to make sure nothing was muted6. Turn phone on on safe mode to ensure it wasnt the apps that were buggy (and played a video I had stored on my phone but same issue)

  Initial reviewPerformance  of the phone is slow for normal day to day activities.  You can lag in opening  apps like outlook, gmail and any other  day to day apps. Some items you can see lag in animation. I have changed setting to use less animation after that also seeing  the performance lags. No worth for amount.  The reason for performance  is Samsung uses their own processor  which slow.After one week of usageif the phone batter down to 20%, then phone will go to completely not usable state. Finally i put charge and re-started the phone to make it work.Camera is good. Battery stands for 1.5 days for normal usage. Worst performance phone for day of day use.Finally, here is the root of the problem. This mobile has ghost touching problem. Totally useless now.

"
"

  Battery life is better than my previous phone which was a 4000MAh. I am yet to rigorously test it through gaming and continuous wifi or data being on.Camera on the front does a horrible job. Shame on Samsung that they name it a 32Mp camera. The back camera does a decent job but not upto the expectation of a quad camera set with 64Mp.RAM is pretty good and I feel the phone has no lag and it doesn't hang.Speaker voice quality is average and could be  better.The body is extremely disappointing as it's a fingerprint magnet and Samsung doesn't give you a back cover at least.Facial recognition takes a lot of timeConclusion: can't expect any better than this on the price range.However, samsung and Amazon have blown the hype out of proportion especially when they know that business value is lesser when competing with the likes of Xiaomi or Vivo or Realme

  Fair review after one week of usage:Pros: 1. The display quality and size is quite very nice. The cover i would suggest is Spigen Hybrid case for a complete protection.2. The fingerprint sensor is fast.3. The latest android 10 provides it with vast features.4. The trending USB Type C port is latest compared to other lower range samsung phones.5. The ocean blue colour makes a premium feel in hand.6. Battery life is quite very good.7. The expandable storage through micro sd is quite appreciable.8. The processor is fast and good for gaming.9. It competes with other samsung phones and is a good replacement for J series in terms of features, speed, processor and ram.Cons: 1. No back cover and earphones are provided by samsung with this phone which isn’t expected. Though all the lower range phones of other brands have these basic things.2. The back panel is polymide plastic which could have been a glass one to give it a premium feel like in Redmi note 8 Pro which too has almost the same price tag.3. The face unlock does not always recognise the face and have to work with fingerprint or other methods of unlock.4. The display seems to be fragile and prone to scratches and cracks if hybrid case and tampered is not used.5. The charging is a bit slow.6. The phone lags sometimes while unlocking through lock screen which isn’t expected with this processor and android version.7. The sound output could have been more.8. The fingerprint sensor is located too above on the back panel.9. The camera quality is average and could have been much better as compared to other brands with this price.The phone could have been a beast if these features were improved by samsung. I will conclude by saying, Its a very good phone in this price tag if these cons does not matter your day to day usage. Though its the best phone in all the lower range series of samsung.

  The WORST phone you can get in this range, front camera pics quality is so worst that it looks like an oil paint job with all smudged, NO SHARPNESS at all. The curve of display is so round it doesn't even  feel like a rounded rectangle, it's an OVAL. EVERTHING IS PLASTIC, The software processing, image processing, performance processing  is just bad, no its WORST. The game booster which is provided doesn't  seems like its boosting anything than consumption of battery. A LOT OF HEAT IS GENERATED in usage of 1 hour even while doing normal tasks.In conclusion, even if someone  is giving  this SAMSUNG M31 for free DON'T BUY IT.  M31 is just a hoax of a specs and nothing more, the worst of all. This was my first samsung phone, gone with the brand's name and it's simply disappointing,NEVER GONNA BUY ANOTHER  SAMSUNG PRODUCTNow with this AMAZON POLICY OF NOT REFUNDING, feels like the most regrettable decision of the year, feels like mental torture spending 17K for this M31. SIMPLY WORST. Seriously  need my money back, NEED REFUND for this product, WORST PRODUCT in every aspect.

  UPDATE: I hate this phone... how can a phone just crash and reboot lying on the table without being used? This *NEVER* happened with my Motorola G5 Plus!======================================================================================Looks surprisingly thin. But not great. Samsung UI is ok, but not great. Lots of bloatware.. some I could uninstall, but some I couldn't. Installed Microsoft Launcher over the Samsung UI.Took some photos.. it didn't stand out. Though I need to take more photos to judge.The one thing which I absolutely HATE is the position of the single speaker.... it's just where I usually place my right pinky finger to hold up the phone. And this drowns out the sound of the video. It's very important to buy a phone with dual speakers.. preferably one that is at the top.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------Updated after more than a month of usage:- The phone heats up during charging.- It has crashed and rebooted 2-3 times while in the middle of something.- Low light videos are TERRIBLE.- Compass calibration keeps going wrong. Every time I have to use it, I need to re-calibrate it.- Speaker is not good at all. Part of the reason is the placement. My 3 year old Moto G5 Plus was much better.I wish I had bought the Redmi Note 9 Pro :(

  Editing the review since camera results are very poor. Too much smudges and noises and looks like either faulty product or incorrect advertisement regarding camera specs.Well crafted product, but very poor camera qualityPros -good picture qualityNice displayBiometrics is fasterBlue color on the back looks classyGood batter lifeCons-Given the specifications found the performance a bit lackingOverall a good phone for the given price range

"
"

  This phone is great with battery backup and picture quality but within 8 days the phone got in bootloop as sson as I got a new update and I did it. This is not even starting now.

"

  Do not buy this phone.Its display quality is very bad. My one month old Galaxy M31 phone developed crack in display. It does not have any physical damage from outside. Now Samsung service center is taking Rs. 5000 to repair it. Just one month back I have purchased it and it is under warranty, but they are charging money to repair it.Today I called Samsung Service Center, but nobody is picking up phone. More than 10 days have passed, they have taken my phone but no status update from them.Just now (21 Sept 2020) I received a call from Samsung, they informed me that spare parts is not available for this M31 model, so they will refund (coupon) me the purchase price by deducting Rs.5200 for the defective display.My question to Amazon and Samsung is that how you can tell that replacement spare is not available for this newly lunched phone? Just 2 months back this phone was launched.So, requesting Amazon and Samsung to refund full purchase price of the phone and also compensesation. No coupon will be accepted, transfer in my bank account.When you are selling any products, you are bound to provide spare part support upto it's end-of-life/support date. Did you mean EOL/EOS reached in just 2 months?

"
"

  Hangs up in 2 months. Had to loose entire Data. Samsung service centres is always full with atleast 100 people in line. That speaks about the quality . Had similar experience in the past. Trusted Samsung for second time in vain. Never Buy Samsung Products. within 2 months touch not working and hangs up frequently.

"

  Before buying this phone, I had some doubt but after using this for almost one month, I am 💯 percent sure to say that, Samsung mid range phones are shit,Front camera quality is as bad as VGA one,Rear camera: always struggles to focus on close clicks, this phone has 64 MP camera but even my 16 MP phone camera perform far better, I can share the pics for comparison,Battery: this phone comes with 6000 battery but works as 4500 battery back up, maximum 12 hours, and the slow charging add more dimerit to it,Display: good,Performance: bad, very very bad, I don't know if my phone has some problem or Samsung is just proving it's  legacy of bad performaing mid range phones, this phone starts lagging while opening very normal apps, like WhatsApp, and YouTube, in have to say that m31 is  1.5 second slow in opening any app in comparison with my 4 GB RAM  cell phone.Design: does not feel sleek and premium in hand due to plastic body, but we could take that bulky design if battery works as expected because it has 6000 mah battery in it, but battery performance of this phone is simply bad.Sorry Samsung for this critical and negative review, but I have to say that you need to work on your midrange phones as well,

  Well I bought this phone after listening to all the appraisal its getting around.I bought a 6 GB Variant with 128 GB internal storage.The day it came it was fineWorking fineNow its.been about a month i have been using it..My Reviews for camera .... CAMERA QUALITY IS JUST FINE but the features given like AR DOODLE etc are amazing...BATTERY LIFE IS ABOUT 1 AND A HALF DAY of normal usageGestures are amazingPROCESSOR is kinda slow which leads to lagging sometimes especially when using AR Doodle and Of course during PUBG .. Normal Heating Issue not that big of a problemThere is a slight network problem with this phone as i compared it with my 2 friends phonesOverall the processor could have been much betterOther than processor( which is most important) everything else is upto the mark

"
"

  Its OS Software got crashed in first update build release and it happened to all the M31 devices

"
"

  As I waited for a really long time to buy my Samsung galaxy phone, I am pretty disappointed with the performance of this phone.The camera quality and features are fine . But the fingerprint reader asks for so many attempts.Major issue with this phone is that it keeps restarting for no reason. That too 3 to 4 times a day !Intially I thought it needs an update and might work fine after that but that didn't work too.It's not very pleasing when it restarts in the middle of some important work you trying to finish.I have been using this phone for a month now but it has not been working upto my expectations.Sorry but not happy with my purchase.

"
"

  Dont buy samsung phones, Only gud for display clearity otherwise worst to but.Also cant return in amazon. within 2 days i tried to cantact amazon Customer service but cant reach them after reach them they said cant do return or replace so better go and buy any show rooms its better,

"
"

  I ordered this phone and received on time. Thanks to Amazon. But once I opened the packet, the box was sealed, but the phone looked to be used already like may be for 1-2 days. There was a little scratch on the side of the phone, many applications weren’t working properly on the phone (ex: YouTube, Spotify), but eventually YouTube was fine but Spotify still has problem. I thought it to be problem of software, I reset the phone but nothing helped. Amid lockdown, I made peace with the phone but the just on the second day I was having problem with phone like my voice to the other person on calls was distorted and the other time the other person’s voice to me was distorted. I called amazon, twice thrice, but they suggested to diagnose the problem through their so called smart check application and my bad luck, and it didn’t show any problem. And for scratches, the amazon guys asked me to send photos but I don’t have DSLR to capture those small scratches (poor me). I ended up being denied for replacement or refund for the phone.I feel I am cheated on this particular product, I have invested rs. 15999 for a not reliable phone in my hand. It may stop working any time.Poor experience with amazon as well as the Samsung galaxy m31.I don’t even want to keep this phone, It gave me that bad experience in just 2 days of using it. But amazon is not supporting at all.

  Worst phone ever bought, don't  buy, charging slow, heating issues,  phone  gets heated in one small call, I will  return it,...

"

  Most disgusting service from Amazon & Samsung ever. Received a defected Mobile which had issues with its touchscreen. Replacing the phone is such a pain in the wrong place. First they ask you to download a stupid app to run testing which takes incorrect tests. I have problem with my touchscreen & they test the fingerprint sensor & give a result stating that all is good. Secondly I cannot contact any customer care agent as no one is available at this point of time. Customers are left to fend for themselves. ""Atmanirbhar"" is taken to a whole new level by Amazon!!! Utterly DisgustingPlease sort this out Amazon before your customers shift to other online apps.Samsung, Where has your quality gone? Do you only focus on expensive phones? One Plus & other brands have already started eating up your market share.. please act wisely if you don't want to share your fate with Nokia.

"
"

  The mobile is a typical Samsung phone nothing special. The only attraction is quad camera and that too is not good, picture quality is like 8 MP camera. I exchanged my Vivo V9 with it and now i'm regretting it. Vivo V9 was far better than M31. If you are going by smart look and quad camera than i am sure this phone will disappoint you.

"
"

  Totally flop phone,worst experience of my life to buy this mobile.After 15 days of purchase camera fail,always hanging problem.Now service center tell mother board and camera of this phone require to change.I feel cheated,I don't no whom to blame-AMAZON/SELLER/SAMSUNG.But my suggestion is never brought this M31.After spending a huge amount now I am running towards SERVICE CENTRE and there is a huge waiting during this pandemic and as usual server problems.Now today my phone is submitted and may be in 3-5days its problem solved.

"
"

  Bought this phone.  Received in time.  delivery is good.  Product is very very bad.  Plan to exchange it even for china mobiles.  I bought this mobile as my friend is happily using M30 for 2yrs.  I thought M 31 will be better than M30.1.  Audio quality is very very bad -  Not able to hear even when speaker is on with max volume and all equalizer settings.  All possible solutions available on line were tried in vain.2.  Frequently hangs even for a simple task like calling!  Then we have to press the power key to switch off and switch on -  this happened 4-5 times in 10 daysI dont feel like using a new mobile.  Not worth for 20,000.  I am planning to exchange it.

"
"

  I ordered the phone on June 1, which was delivered on June 5. I tried to start the phone. It didn't. I put it in the charger. No light. Nothing. Phone was completely dead. Same day I tried to put request Amazon replace/ refund section. Now here comes the worst part. It does not allow you to refund/ replace. Rather, it asks you to talk to customer service. However, there is no one in customer service to answer your phone. I tried to call directly at Amazon 1800 number. It does not connect.

"
"

  I bought this phone for my dad and Samsung is known for the durability plus 6000 mah battery is the highlight of this phone so it has long battery life also camera quality is good too. I bought this phone at freedom sale so I get a discount of 10 percent on the price so its a good deal.... If long battery life and durability is your purpose for phone then go for it without any thought.

"
"

  I never had a bad experience but this is the bad choice , I choosed to buy samsung m31 phone. Bad experience. Main problem is too badly got heat back camera part and when you will make a call same back portion will vibrant. And also company given 6gb ram when you play online games , games will lack too badly. Maybe companies fault . Lots friends said after samsung is not a. Good phone for roughly use. This is ladies phone. Really I am agry for this. I got lots of problems. Even I didn't go for return coz from the next day lockdown also started.

"

  I recently purchased m31 mobile set. I am very much frustrated with the net connection. In my area Airtel network is very strong. But the internet connection is automatically disconnected in this mobile. Do everything but could not solve the problem. In the past I had used same data. There was no problem. But after purchasing m31 set I  am fully dissatisfied with the data service. In the data symbol only  uploading arrow blinking. Downloading arrow stops blinking after sometime. I think this is a hardware problem. Please arrange to replace my mobile as early as a possible.Add tags

"
"

  Phone is good. Value for money, but sound quality is not good. While playing Facebook,Youtube and other MX Player or internal video's it's not getting sound. If I restart then phone then its sounding. I'm facing oftenly but it's not resolved yet. And Wifi hotspot is not working properly while connecting to desktop or Laptop. But its connecting to mobiles. I raised for exchange phone, let's see what will happen. But I never expects this type of problems by SAMSUNG. Really upset....!!

"
"

  Received my Samsung Galaxy M31 on 7th Mar. It cost me 15,999 rupees.Literally shocked to see the Indian sim card only labeled on box.Immediately called Amazon customer and their response is pathetic. They said they cannot write everything about product.Product description is based on what features they want to show to customer. As it is a electronic item so there is no return possible, only replacement option is available if there is any fault in the product and cannot do anything more.They are not ready to accept the fact that they are hiding such a important information that this phone cannot be used outside India.Learnt my lesson and will not be ordering any high value product from Amazon in future.They are only good enough for groceries and small items.

  I am a tech guy and this review is genuine. First of all Samsung is the baap of mobiles..coming to m31 I waited so long to buy and saw many reviews.lets start from positive..1. Camera is awesome both front and back. Picture clarity in zoom is good2. Very smooth finish of mobile which looks really great3. Touch is better than other mobiles compared to Oppo or MIComing to negative pointsall reviews almost fake regarding battery...they just really bluffed..6000 mah battery is not even coming for 2 full days..I used data for around 18 hrs but still it got drained fast.When charged the mobile it taking around 4 hrs to get complete charge from 0 to 100 percentage  but mobile is getting heated a lot..didn't expect this from Samsung at all.Loud speaker is not so efficient.Normal sound is goodAs its SAMOLED the picture or video quality is good..eyes r not strained

  I have used Redmi mobiles for the past 3 years. I just wanted to change to Samsung for a change of experience. And you know what, it's turned out to be a good decision. Samsung Galaxy is an absolute beast. It looks elegant and operates smoothly with quite a lot of good quality features. I am enjoying using this mobile.Pros:* camera: video and image quality and available modes are too good at this price. It's good to have a 64MP camera. It works well in night light also.* Battery life is good.* No heating issues found while using and charging, unlike redmi mobiles.* No need of unnecessary mandatory apps installation like in redmi.* I feel like this mobiles  GUI is amazing and better than Redmi mobiles GUI (maybe because I got bored using redmi mobiles??).* Dolby sound system is too good. You can feel the difference if you compare audio quality with other mobile phones audio.* Smart switch app from Samsung helps to copy all the data from your previous mobile to this one. It's a good feature.* This mobile operates so smoothly.*Amoled display is amazing.Cons:* Face unlock system sometimes fails in darkness. Samsung should have worked on this feature pre-release. But it works fine in daylight.Overall a good experience and recommended product.Just a suggestion, if you are buying this mobile please spend 500 more bucks and buy Spigen back cover, mobile looks elegant with it. You will love your mobile more. Dont go for cheap quality back covers. You will regret it later.Update: After using it for 1 month, I have found that the internet speed is bit low when compared to other mobiles and sometimes internet disconnects automatically for some seconds.

  The phone is overall good but have some problems such as camera doesn't  have autofocus. Battery has 6000mah capacity but get down very speedily phone gets hot when data is open and you are not using phone

"
"

  Rs 16999 for M31, It's worst product in this price segment.Camera quality is not better than vivo 21 mp, however Samsung is claiming 60 mp, which is Myth.Battery last in 1-9 hours. It takes around 3.5 hours to charge the battery fully (Samsung claim 2.5 hours)Its processor is quite slow, not getting required internet speed.I found 2 folds decrease in internet speed with this model.Touch is poor, you will find difficulty even in the slide to pick calls.Phone is getting hot even during calling and very very hot while on chargingIts buttons (power and volume) are getting pressed autonomously even without mobile coversI recommend you to never purchase such poor performance mobile phone. Please do not buy.

  Phone is good! But there is an issue of heating sometimes TOO MUCH HEATING!Front camera: 3* is not very realistic!!Main camera: 4* not very impressive!Display: 5*Battery: 3.5* it doesn't last as per 6k MaySpeed: 3* justifies the price but not impressive!!weight balance: 3* averagespeaker: 1.5* not loud at allcharging speed: 1*

  It's been only a few days of purchase.  So far the experience is good. My usage is minimal for basic emails, social media chats, picture sharing etc. Very less usage for voice/video calls as well. No gaming. Battery seems to last three days easily on one full charge.What makes me proud to own this device is that in all the years I have owned a cell phone, this is the first time I am holding a ""Made in India"" device. Proud of that . Will post an update later based on future experience

  I have very disgusting experience with samsung. Im totaly dissatisfied with samsung m 31 series. I could only use for 3 days with smoothly. I dont know how why the product fail to accept my finger print and security pattern.  On next morning when i tired my fingerprint pattern were functioning properly aftr few minutes the same problem arise out of nowher. I have given my phone to Samsung store for repairing i hope it will resolve the issue..

  Worst phone ever I bought. I ordered the phone in 1st day of lunch. I got timely delivery but  After using for 29 days phone got hang up while updating software. Now phone is locked for more than 2days in a screen showing AVB error . I tried to restart phone many time but still showing same . Even I let the phone to get switch off by itself after consumption of battery still showing same while charging.Now I can't return it because they say return period were till 27th march. Lockdown nation wide still on can't go to Samsung care centre. I'm giving those stars because I don't have any option for zero.I don't understand what should I do.

  I bought 2 phones 10 days back. Biggest problem is from day 1, in both mobiles every now and then signal drops completely and I need to restart the phone to get signal back. I can't even make calls forget internet.When I searched about this in net and samsung members app, it was shocking that many phones have this problem. Kindly know this before purchasing M31. I did all that was suggested by samsung but nothing worked. Now I have to waste time going to service center.Another shocking fact is non of the reviews have pointed this problem where on the internet there are many people affected.If this is not sorted, I will sue samsung!

  Received the phone 20 days back. After a long gap I am back to Samsung Brand and I must say the phone is awesome almost in all departments. The performance of 6GB/128 GB handset is definitely above the mark, ergonomically designed phone fits into the palm well , hence its a pleasure to hold the phone. The camera quality is good, ease of using, navigation is extremely user friendly and the  finger print sensor is good, not yet explored face recognition feature. Most of the important apps are pre-installed hence its again a plus point and more importantly Microsoft tools are re pre-installed, Just one draw back which I  found in the phone as of now is the app lock facility is not available need to install a separate app from the play store, this should have given as a preinstalled feature.My verdict is go for the phone its an awesome piece not from china so that's another satisfaction of holding this handset.

  Worst phone ever i purchased in my life. First Time I was fool,only by his camera I was buy this phone. But camera quality is very poor. There is problem in Network also some time internet will not work properly. But when insert sim on my other handset I net will gave the very decent speed. I'm using this phone from 6months. But trust me this phone is horrible. And now there is no any option if I buy other handset by exchanging this. When go to exchange of the phone but there not available this phone in list. I need my money take your phone 😭

  Phone is very slow because of the custom OS of Samsung, press lock button and it takes half a second to lock the screen, gets hanged too, not worth the price. Battery takes long to charge. Compared to other smartphone in the same price range, it's not worth buying unless you want phone with long battery life and the brand name.

"

  This is my first Samsung mobile i ever buy and worse product I ever buy. Plz don't be mislead by 64mp quad cameras and 6000amh battery. Fast charging literally doesn't work it took almost 2hours to get 100% charge with 15w charger . Front camera is worse camera but with update it get little better. we can't turn on flast while wide angle photo It is not even week since I bought , suddenly screen touch stop working , can't restart or do anything on it . Lying useless at moment . Shame on you Samsung .

  I will not recommend this product to anyone due to the following facts:1. Exynos 9611, which is a 10 nm processor, produces so much lagg.2. 6000 mah battery is just a gimmick. It is also not comparable with even 4000 mah battery of other brands. It does not even last for a single day with moderate usage i.e. surfing with wifi connectivity (no gaming or watching videos).3. 64 mega pixel camera is another gimmick. No detailing is there. Capture is very much grainy. Pixel is also visible.4. Build quality is just not bearable. It gives feel similar to 7-8k phone. Cheap plastic is used in the back.5. Charging time is horrible. Near about 2.5 hours for full charge. It gives feel of black and white time!!I tried several times to contact Amazon technical team but they are not responding. Hopeless!!

  I brought it on the first day(March 5) it was released and seems good but after software upgradation it went for error.You cannot switch on/off your mobile...Ot will show an error message if you put charge and it go off after the battery hot fully drained....I gave it samsung service center on 13th june 13 after the lockdown still they are working on it first week they said they are awaiting patches from Samsung second week they said mother board has to be changed and this week i dont know what they are going to say....I gave it for wife as a gift but she blames  that i haven't choosen a worthy one...I haven't used the mobile more than a month and it's surprise to hear a new mobile not even a Month old got mother board problem this shows the quality of the mobile...Most frustrating thing is none will your call they have land line and mobile number...If your fortunate they may answer you call after you continuously call them more than 50 times....If you want to put yourself in trouble by your hard earned money then you have to choose this mobile....

  Overall phone hardware is great. Amazing display, good camera features, awesome battery life and sturdy to hold.  The only downside is it doesn't support 4G+ aka carrier aggregation. Owing to this,  unless you have full tower,  the voice would break and data speed would go down! The hardware supports this feature but Samsung has not activated th CA feature. Even my two year old moto had this! This is turning out a dud for me especially for indoor coverage with work from home.  If I would have known this earlier I wouldn't have brought this phone :(  please do something about this!!

  I bought this mobile in last Friday , it is not working from 6th day. Unable to receive calls and if unexpectedly I received a call not getting sound and I can't here the opposite person voice or my voice to them. When I try to call someone automatically network is getting disconnected and it's reconnecting automatically in few minutes.I expect this might be software issue , I have gone through lot of reviews ,maximum number of people who buyed this mobile facing this issue.Unable to replace the mobile also as it is not showing any option to me. Plz no bay this mobile

"
"

  Please don't buy this phone. It has major heating issues. It gets drastically heated while watching videos, while taking photos, during calls and also while charging. 6000mah battery is just for name sake. It works for 1 to 1.25 days without heavy usage. Full charging takes upto 3hrs. Speaker quality is also bad.The only good thing about this phone is camera.

"

  Operating and dispaly is not goodNot user friendlyNot as per expexted quality

  Don't buy this product....1. There is no return option.2. No camera quality3. No battery back up4. Taking 5 hrs upto charging full5. Worst package ...They Don't care .6. Full Bugs. Applications are closing due to errors7. No headset , No Back Cover ( Only Charger &  Phone in the box )8. Go for Redmi note 9 pro...( Same Rate )  Quality better than this phone )

"
"

  This phone has mic problem...... Very inconvenient to use.... I regret buying this phone! So expensive... N yet below average performance.... I have to always hold the phone close to my mouth so that other person can hear well.... Forget about other features... Even if they are good, the mix performance masks it all!!!

"

  Changing my review after 3 months of usage. It is not getting on!!!!! Not working within 3 months????!!! Extremely dissapointed.. no option is there to call Amazon for this and no response from Amazon. Need to go to service centre. This third time i bought samsung phone. My phone is dead suddenly.

  Feedback:I Ordered Samsung Galaxy M31 within 1 minutes after-sale starts. This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag. I'm writing after a few days of usage and Again I re-order from this same model same colour and same configuration. price range very attractive and all requirement full fill. Really impressed by the quality of the camera. All 4 back cameras are working great. Wide-angle feature is great. Live focus, Macro and Slow-motion features are awesome. Front camera is very good. I may not require to carry my DSLR everywhere.Delivery was fast, packing was good,I share my experience with my friend they also buy this same product and also happy.Good:- Wi-Fi Calling Facility is to good.- The display is excellent with Blue light filter.- The performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.- 6000 Mah battery (More than 1.5 Days running with Internet)- 512 GB Memory card supported with dedicated external card slot.- Fast charging and 15W charger top with the phone.- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is goodBuild Quality:This phone is fully made of plastic but the build quality is good. The back of the phone looks like glass but it also made from plastic so it scratches easily. So, use a Back Cover.Overall Rating:- Camera 5/5- Performances 5/5- Display 5/5 - Super Amoled Display- Battery 5/5- 6000 Mah- Phone look 4/5 (This phone is fully made of plastic)- User interface 5/5 - New Samsung One UI 2 is awesome- Sound 5/5 - Dolby atmos Enhanced very much sound effect on Headset.Go for it without any doubt.

  I recently purchased an M21 for my father and was more than happy with its overall performance, be it the camera, battery or software performance. Hence, decided to upgrade my mother's phone as well and Samsung M series being Proudly Made in India and a non Chinese but a Korean brand, ordered the M31 128GB.To my surprise, I was even more amazed when the phone arrived. Everything the M21 was best at, was carried over and the Camera performance was even more improved in every aspect.The sharpness, AF, colours, and also video performance was improved over M21 which itself is good.No wonder the phone is selling like hot cakes all over India. My only regret now is, I didnt knew the M31s was launching. Else I would have waited for the M31s which going by the reviews, is a monster in Camera segment.Anyway, since my moms and dads phones have been set and purchased already, I think I need a phone upgrade for myself and it sure will be a Samsung. Probably the upcoming A71S 5G or an A51s 5G since i have read up about the about to be released Samsung phones.

  Writing this review after 10 days of usage.Pros:1. Samsung's Super AMOLED Screen2. Massive 6000 mAh battery3. 64 MP Quad Camera4. One UI 2.0 based on Android 10 out of the box5. Dolby Atmos SupportCons:1. Exynos 9611 is fair enough to handle the daily work but it's a little old processor, it would be better if it would come with any of the latest ones.2. Fingerprint sensor is adequately fast but it's a capacitive and back mounted. It would be better if it would have in display one.3. The phone has a massive 6000 mAh battery and it supports fast charging only upto 15 watt. It would be better if would support 25 watt because it takes quite a time to charge the battery fully.N.B. I am not a gamer. I haven't done any gaming. You will need to go to YouTube for gaming reviews.

  No quality in camera functions, battery is like normal phones only No change in it. Fingerprints accessible is not quick, phone is getting heat while in communication or using product. While using applications phone is getting hanged.

"

  I ordered this phone first time it came with a number of issues like overheating and damaged product. Second time when they replaced they again gave me a phone with poor battery performance which does not even lasts upto 12hrs.With similar usuage with other persons known to us it is lasting upto 24 hrs plus. We have deliberated checked this issue. Overall a unsatisfactory experience.

"
"

  1. Basic features is missing put in this phone like app lock etc.2. 64MP Camera quality is not up to the mark, it looks like an ordinary camera.3.  Phone is little bit slow.4.  Feels heavy in hand.5.  Took so long for charging.

"
"

  Very bad phone, not worth it. Even Amazon refused to to do the replacement. Feeling cheated by amazon. Next time no purchase any expensive item from Amazon.

"
"

  Don't buy. Not worth 15k. Worst camera. Phone is getting warm for normal usage(not even playing games). You cannot return this after buying. Amazon will tell stories instead of refunding.Amazon technician is not visiting on time and it's very frustrating after paying 15 k for this nonsense piece. Farid amazon.

  Updates after couple of weeks of usage!!‐----‐--‐---------‐-----Stay away from this! Biometrics is a joke! Never ever again will choose a Samsung product for mobile!Updates after couple of days usage...1. Battery power seems to be good!2. Fast charging is a let down!3. Finger print sensor doesn't work most of the times and required constant cleaning!! I would rather use face lock!!4. Memory (6GB) is not performing well. Recommend to go for 8GB.=====================================With lot of excitement, i bought this phone and to my disappointment it is an utter flop! Phone heated up like anything which i was setting it up and I could immediately feel that the phone had problems. May be for 16K this is what you get?? But might disappointed as I have used other low cost phones and have never faced such problems. Now, I thought Samsung as a brand was good, but I realized that it is not about the brand name always. Stay away from this model,5 star for shipping and delivery. However the product is a let down!!!

  I purchased Samsung NEW on the very day of its launch. Got delivery next day. Actually it arrived before estimated time.This I have been using the phone for about one week now. It's a fantastic phone.1. Design, slimness, weight is very impressive.2. Display sAMOLED is simply superb. Color production stunning.3. I have purchased M30s also a few months ago. M31's display is even better than M30s.4. Battery lasts for about 2 days on usual use time. I have Samsung On Max also. Which I have to charge twice a day. But NEW easily runs for 2 days.5. Camera is also very good, both rear and front. I have taken some night photos without using flash. They, beautifully captured the subjects with clear details. Front camera is equally good.6. It's lighter than M30s (which is also having 6000mah battery).7. Phone doesn't get heated up much even on continuous use.8. One good feature Samsung has added is caller identity. It detects spams automatically. No need to install Truecaller.9. It also has QR Code scanner. This is very helpful.Overall it's a fantastic phone at this price range. I am fully satisfied having purchased this phone10. Night mode photos are stunning. The first photo given above is of Hyderabad nightline, taken from my balcony.11. Next two photos are of clouds taken from an Indigo flight.12. Next snap is of cardamom flowers in my garden.13. The last one is pav baked by me at home. Snap taken with Food Mode. I found in food mode pictures coming alive.I especially impressed with night mode and food .Ode photos. They are si.ply superb.

  Phones battery life is good but it gets heated for example when you are on call for a long time for while booking cabs when location is on it takes a lot of battery No pop up notifications in WhatsApp phone needs work in accessibility I am a low vision person the phones keyboard gets too much expanded when using zoom gesture making it impossible to type I have to reboot the whole phone to get the keyboard to its normal size . Select to speak options hangs frequently and the phone becomes unaccessible.after my purchase there was a software update due to which my screen gets zoom automatically creating problem while using which is very irritating face recognition is not that good phone takes two and a half hour to charge completely.Camera is really nice beautiful pictures come out.

"
"

  Not worth it when you compare it with Xiaomi phonesIssues--Heavier than MI phones--Screenshot is not by scrolling  3 fingers as in MI phones. You need to press power button and volume button simultaneously--screen mirroring is very poor does not works-- Camera is also poor than MI phones-- while opening web link gives only one option to open using Samsung Browser.-- many other usability issues.--overall you will feel going back to MI due to issues in usability

"

  Missing app lock and secure folder, I hope software update will fix it in future.Headphone is missing 😩.Downloaded s secure from galaxy store for App lock.Removed unnecessary preloaded apps.Add restrictions for background data if you want to save data and battery.Great Camera tested in all moods(check in pictures).Night mood is superb.Anyone posting bad reviews about camera is personal intentions.Freefire or pubg consums 6% battery per hour. But remember it depends on your network speed.Fast charging is working perfectly,Still moving my apps from old galaxy J7 Pro, I will update my review after 1 month.Nice phone.

  1. Camera is not up to the expectation2. Battery doesn't seem to be 6000 Mah it hardly last 1 day further takes 2.5 to 3 hrs to get fully charged worried if this is huge battery life and fast charging, what will be the normal one from Samsung.Hope the company have test check the features, if not kindly do it to get the correct facts.Other brands which are way smaller than the samsung brand offer better performance.

"

  Good phone in mid range. Though the plastic back takes away the premium feel of using samsung brand. Function wise it's good. But looks wise the company could do better using glass or metal.Fingerprint reader is accurate and so is face recognition.Battery is powerful and long lasting. Keeps you going all day!Camera quality is awesome and comes with many cool features also! Pictures and videos are sharp and true to their color and high quality.Overall, it comes with many features and the brand Samsung adds to the value and trustworthiness of this phone!! Using it for three months now. Smooth and perfect.PA: no proper cover available. I wish samsung provided it.even if for extra cost with high quality for protection.Couldn't find any till date. Help me if someone has recommendations.:(

  Let’s start with the first strong point of the Samsung Galaxy M31, the design. The phone is quite lightweight in spite of sporting a huge 6,000mAh battery. The phone is quite comfortable to hold in your hand, though the one-handed operation is not that great. The sides are slightly curved, which provides a good grip and the power button is each to reach. The phone is available in two colour options, Ocean Blue and Space Black. We got the latter for review and it sure looks premium, though it picks up fingerprints and smudges, so putting in a case is the best option.Another area where the Galaxy M31 does a good job is the display. The smartphone is loaded with a 6.4-inch Full HD+ Infinity U display with a screen resolution of 2400 x 1080 pixels. The display is protected with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection. The display delivers some good results as the colours were bright and text looked sharp in our testing. Furthermore, the phone supports Widevine L1 support, meaning that you can stream HD content on Netflix and Amazon Prime Videos.Samsung Galaxy M31: Camera ReviewThe Galaxy M31 offers you improved performance in terms of the cameras. The phone is loaded with a 64-megapixel main camera with f/1.8 aperture, an 8-megapixel wide-angle camera with f/2.2 aperture, a 5-megapixel depth camera with f/2.2 aperture, and 5-megapixel macro lens with f/2.4 aperture. For the front, there will be a 32-megapixel selfie camera with f/2.0 aperture.Galaxy M31That said, the camera performance is quite decent in the daylight conditions. The photos came out to be punchy and well-detailed. The phone does a good job in taking macro shots, though you need to get used to it. The wide-angle lens offers you a better field of view, though detailing goes for a toss in this mode. The selfie performance is decent as well, though you might find some oversaturation in the photos.In low light conditions, the Samsung Galaxy M31 does an average job. In our testing, we found out the photo taken in low light conditions shows loss of quality. The details are not that impressive in nature and you will notice lots of grains and noises in the image. The wide-angle mode in the low light also performs quite average in our opinion as the results were not at all impressive. The Night mode comes to the rescue and the photos came out to be slightly better using Night Mode in the camera, though it automatically zooms in up to 2x when you switch to this mode. This some times spoils the whole composition, which can be frustrating at times. Moving on, the Live Focus mode is not that amazing as the edge detection still needs some improvements.Samsung Galaxy M31: Battery and Security ReviewGalaxy M31The smartphone is loaded with a 6,000mAh battery with 15W fast charging support. The major highlight of the Galaxy M31 is the battery backup. In our testing, we found out that the phone delivers up to 2 days of battery backup under normal to mixed usage. Even if you do lots of gaming or stream content, the battery life will not disappoint you. Coming to the charging speeds, the smartphone takes up to 2 hours to get from 3 per cent to 100 per cent.Coming to the security, the phone is loaded with a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor along with face unlock feature. The fingerprint sensor works just fine and you will not face any trouble while unlocking the smartphone. Furthermore, the face unlock feature works good in well-lit conditions, though it shimmers a bit in low-light areas.Samsung Galaxy M31: Performance ReviewGalaxy M31The Samsung Galaxy M31 is powered by a Samsung Exynos 9611 processor. This is the same chipset, which is found in Galaxy A51. The chipset provides some good results in day-to-day scenarios and you will not face any kind of lag or shutter. When it comes to multi-tasking or pushing the phone, it shows some sign of lag. In the gaming section, one can play casual games like Subway Surfers, Johnny Triggers and more without any lag, however, when it comes to high-end games like PUBG Mobile or Asphalt series, the phone does a decent job as well. That said, you will notice that the phone warms up quite a bit during extended gaming sessions.On the software front, the Galaxy M31 runs on Android 10 with company’s custom user interface OneUI 2.0 running on top of it. The user interface is refined as compared to the previous versions and you get new Dark Mode, which is a good thing. Apart from this, you get gesture-based navigation controls along with Focus Mode, Digital Wellbeing and Parental Controls. Apart from this, you get some standard features like double-tap to wake, gesture-based screenshot and more. On the downside, you still see a lot of bloatware in the phone including Google and Microsoft app suites along with other apps like Netflix, Facebook, Samsung Max and more. My Galaxy application is one annoying app that keeps sending you to push notifications throughout the day.

  First time I plugged in for charging. Phone displayed recovery mode screen though I haven't pressed any button. Totally disappointed by this experience.I have requested to return this item and refund me entire amount but amazon policy relaxed upto replacement.Bad experience.Display and look wise phone looks stunning but still I haven't used it so system performance might be well as expected. I hope so.Waiting for brand new replacement of M31. I hope it would work well

   Megamonster is Much Better than i expected after seeing negative reviews.But i trusted samsung n amazon and got the right thing . just getting little hanging problems some times even not using games or heavily space consuming apps.finger print reader, battery life and camera quality are good.My Budget drag me to buy this thing n ihope someday i will be able to purchase premium phones of samsung. 😊💐👍SAM+SUNG S = superiority A = added in M = monsterSung (singing the abv features)(संग) = together (In hindi)So together with samsung we sing n create peace .

  Samsung Galaxy M31 gives you a very high value for the price. Given my price range and the features I was looking for, it was hands-down the best smartphone in the market right now.At this price range, Samsung offers a lot of features in this smartphone that the other brands have not. For example -  AMOLED SCREEN, An enormous 6000 mAh battery and also a 64-megapixel quad-camera!!!This phone makes watching movies a pleasure due to the AMOLED screen for immersive viewing experience and the Dolby Sound as a cherry on the cake.I also, do recommend this product for novice photographers.Conclusion: I am freaking loving this smartphone

  Thanks a lot Amazon for this superb phone. After using the phone for one week I am writing down the reviews. Please go through the same it will help you.1:- Superb super amoled display you cannot get in this range. 5 stars2:-Battery - No words for battery simply awesome 5 stars3:- Camera :-If you have used oppo,vivo or realme then you will not like the camera quality of phone.But if you are using it for the first time then you will like. But camera quality can be better as per this price segment.If you are camera lover then you can go for other phones.Macro camera is worst.4 stars4:-Performance :- Not upto the mark. Sometimes there is a lag. 3.5 stars5:- Games :- If you are game lover then do go for this. 3 stars6:- Storage :- Go with 128 GB storage option don't go for 64 GB 4 starsSo now it's your choice which option you want to go.The charger cable which is received is of low quality and it's very loose. The packing of the phone was not that much good. Not expected from samsung. The phone was having a heavy dust on it when received.

  Wonderful phone for this budget. People talk about lot of specs in the phones like xiaomi  and poco in this price range. But Samsung has all that and longevity as well. Samsung phones don't die on you.The camera setup on this phone is wonderful, the detailing it captures, the colors, the selfies  every thing is perfect.The huge 6000mah battery, just wow. It will easily last for 2 days if not more. Even with high youtubeing and social networking it will last for 2 days.Signal receiving strength is excellent and to add to that it has wifi-calling option as well.Speakers are good, but real deal is listening the music through head phones, it supports Dolby atmos.The rear mounted finger print sensor is at the right place and super fast.The 6.4 inch AMOLED screen is next level. Its Samsung so you can't expect nothing less.With 6 GB RAM the multi tasking is really good.Overall wonderful phone with very decent pricing and its Samsung.  It can't get any better than this in this price range.So go for it and this phone will definitely surprise you.

  Guys don't become a fool and buy this phoneThe phone will start hanging and will switch off in between a call. Touch will not work , you have to end up pressing the touch multiple times to accept end calls or to do any work on phone.Battery life is ok okPhones started hanging in just 2 daysAnd more painful is that Amazon does not have return policy for this. They will send some technician to check it and ""if "" he finds issue phone will be replaced.If I would have known this I would never have purchased it from here.Now only god knows how my problem will be solved. I have came across such issue 1st time ever as I always preferred to buy such electronic items from physical store or not to go for any random low budget phone to avoid any complexity.Rethink before buying this phone from amazon ( if u faced any difficulty they won't return or refund the amount)

  I purchased a samsung M31 on 11 th mar 2020 ,it had heating issues on the upper part of the screen,I have talked to the  customer care regarding this issue,,they told download blancco app,but it is not working properly,I cannot get my money  ,waste of product ,do not buy again ,very disappointed  this kind of experience,mobile inspection  service technician did not came as per confirmation  customer  care,

  I thoroughly like this mobile.Very smooth to handle.The camera is very good in day light and medium to low light.The battery back up is awesome. It took 40 hours for the mobile battery to go from 100 % to 23 %. In this timeframe I had medium usage of the mobile also I used it with wats app live tracking with GPS on for my cycling trip for 8 hours. Also around 3 hours of Google map use.Though I cannot comment much on gaming experience as I don't play games on mobile, but just to experience played subway surfers for 10 minutes and it performed good.Overall a good buy for me as I was searching for a mobile with nice camera and battery.

  An awesome product.Value for money.The battery is so much good that it is unbelievable. About battery I want to say something that please do charge the phone for the first time to 100% fully charge and then use the phone or else the battery life reduces.The camera quality is awesome. Just remember to apply correct settings.Front camera photos looks awesome.Phone performance is also very good. Very smooth controls and the screen quality is also very good.Sound quality is also up to the markThe phone has an excellent sensor coordination for everything.It also has a virtual proximity sensor and an AR support from Google with an excellent gyro sensor.The fingerprint sensor is also very fast.The face unlock feature is above everything.It detects face automatically when your phone is kept upright even without turning screen on. It will detect your face and automatically turn on.The look of the phone is also very nice with a glassy look on back.This is a power packed phone which will always win over any phone in this price range.I think everyone should try this experience.I trust Samsung and still I think it is better to buy a Samsung phone than to buy other phones even if they are offering some more features.I am very happy to write this review.I think this review you make impact a bit.Just stop here and buy this product.After using it you would be feel that your decision was right.Thank you for reading my review till last.

  My review after 2 months usage..Finger print reader working great.Battery life, 1 full day if you use internet streaming. Otherwise u can count for  3 days.Camera Quality good. Long viewshotsworkinggood.Look wise , touch wise its good.It will take 3 hrs to full charge.Facial recognition also poor.Wifi working great.But Signal accessing from mobile Networks was too slow.I will give 0 rating for this Mobile Network Connection.Very very slow internet speed.I have to connect Wifi with others mobile data through Hotspot.Mobile at this price range with such a Horrible networking performance not acceptable.Its my personal view.  Do your own research before you buy.Thank you.

  Camera(VIDEO STABILIZATION dosent work) , battery are good . Phone heats up a little bit but that heating is acceptable .Screen is not as good as Nokia screens and others (IPS LCD ) , IPS LCD would have given a better performance .Screen doesn't give Natural colours.Performance is good . Fingerprint sensor is awsome , it works very Smoothly .The software has better options .Mirror link is not supported by this mobile . If they had provided Mirror screen option then it would have been great ,no 3rd party app supports mirror link .Charging cable is too short .Camera is not as good as Nokia 8.1 ,6 .If the mobile gets IPS LCD SCREEN , SONY IMX CAMERA then the mobile would be so awesome

  At 1st i want to say above all the images are shoot on the samsung m31. The camera quality is amazing just amazing in macro camera awesome the 64mp mood is very good, zooming quality also best, the battery life is very long 5000mah but some how you can't notice the 5000mah, fingerprints scaner is also good, And the PROCESSOR in good but it is not good for gaming, if you use this phone as daily use as other uses then go for it blindly, and overall  its comes in very good condition, thanks amazon for delivering this phone in good condition. Thanks you ARNAB BANERJEE.👍❤️📱

  I have been using this phone for more than 2 weeks and the battery feels like 3000mAh at best.I have used 5000mAh phones from Asus and Panasonic before and those phone easily gave 1.5 to 2 days usage. With the advertised capacity and with a below average processor this should last longer.I am an average user mostly on WiFi and rarely uses mobile data. Very difficult to use it on second day without charging.Charges very slowly and discharges fast. It should have been the other way around.Performance is average. Try to stay away from Exynos processors if you want a reasonably fast phone. But I knew this before buying, so no complaints hereCamera seems decent, but I rarely takes photos and don't think I have enough knowledge to comment on the camera quality

  I have been purchasing Samsung M series phones for self and family for years now and never regretted my choices. The M30s for my FiL and this lovely M31 for myself are both excellent phones at a very very competitive price. With the lastest Android 10 OS and access to both Google and Galaxy playstores, an incredible Amoled screen with excellent touch sensitivity etc., this is a beautiful choice. With a monster battery, even without aggressive conservation settings, you get good milage. The new USB connector is a joy, with the option of high power charging for those urgencies when traveling.. backed by Amazon's super logistics and accessories options, this is a great buy!

  It is a best budget phone with the amount of provided specs in it, having a massive battery of 6000mah gave me a decent backup of upto 2 days, if you are a average user then this is a phone you want, I played all types of games in it from ludo to asphalt 9 and pubg but it stood up to its name as not much of battery drain but minute lags were observed at the start but later on after few second everything got ok, adaptive brightness is very good but was not working some times had to manually set it but sometimes switching it off and on came as a solution, fingerprint sensor is quick but some times doesn't works if it is a bit dusty, also if you hands are wet it will take multiple attempts before giving access, most of the reviews I read about back panel color and material quality was negative as compared with other phones but personally i liked the color of back panel as I have the ocean blue you can call me old fashioned but there are many reasons like 1. It looks good,  2. Doesn't slips from you hand 3. Eventually you are going to use a back cover with it and etc, I have a transparent back cover over mine coz no other color would be that good as it's original, its display is one of the best as the picture quality and the color contrast and many other aspects cannot be compared with other phones in market, it also provided built in Dolby atmos when using earphone which totally changes the experience of audio while watching movies or listening songs its is just amazing, I was averagely satisfied with the camera as the night mode is not that good when compared with other phones, macro shots are very good but struggles a bit to focus, I did not find any much difference between slow mo and ultra slow mo, providing inbuilt custom stickers and emoji are good and enjoyable, speaker volume are good for a average noisy room conditions but not for listening songs outdoors, there are many gestures which takes time to get comfortable with but once you are life gets easier also there are many other features which proved helpful for day to day working environment, over all it is a best phone for average and heavy usage until and unless you are planning to play heavy games on it entire day long with heavy graphics requirementThank you 😁

  A very disappointing buy.I've been using this phone for about 3 days, which is enough to know how the phone performs, and this phone is sub-standard. Let me list the reasons why:1. To begin with the finger print scanner response is very slow. Very often it doesn't recognize the finger.2. With a big battery I was expecting it to.last a day. But with playing light games like Temple Run and Words wirh Friends the battery runs down very quickly. It also takes a little over 3 hours to charge fully.3. Camera performance is pathetic. The 64mp pics look like it's been shot with 8mph lens. And don't even try a pic at night, you won't be able to see anything with clarity.4. The phone feels heavy and cumbersome though it's hardly a few gms heavier than my previous phone.5. The volume buttons are stiff and don't respond to a normal touch.6. The swipe hand gesture to take a screenshot is useless as very often the screen moves along with the hand gesture of you're taking a screenshot on a webpage or Instagram or any other social media app.And though I have more to say, I think this is enough to dissuade you from buying this phone. I'd suggest you go for either the Realme 6 or the Note 9 Pro at the same price.

  First of All I am Not a Gamer I uses phone for calls n l,ill bit of surfing.1.Average Camera2.Phone heating like a bomb even with  normal use.3.Its shows Fast charging on screen but  actually charges slower than Normal  phones which do not have this feature  with same battery capacity.4.Battery last for one day with normal  uses.Final verdict : Lower than average Phone with Bogus and hyped advertisement.

"

  My review after using the phone after 4 months of continuous use as I have ordered it on the day of launch 5th March.Pros:1. The battery is humongous. it's 6000 Mah. It will last for at least 2 days for normal use. For extensive use like 12 hrs of video stream then it will last at least 24-30 hours.2. Exynos 9611 processor comes with Mali-G72 MP3 graphics which are able to handle gaming relatively well.3. It comes with Android 10.0 which is layered with Samsung's own OneUI.4. The camera can capture 4K videos too and the camera quality is really  very good both rear as well as front.5. It has an impressive 6.4-inch Super AMOLED display with minimal bezels.6. It has polycarbonate back which isn’t as premium as a glass-back construction but does seem solid.7. The finger scanner is quick. It supports face unlock as well but it isn't fastest (Still does its job).8. With 6 GB ram, the performance is smooth. No issues so far. 128 GB storage is quite enough.9. It comes with a triple-slot i.e. dual sim option (4g+4g) and a memory card (You can expand up to 512 GB if need be).10. Pixel density is 403 ppi and resolution is 1080 x 2340 pixels.Cons:-1. Night mode isn’t the best.2. It supports a single speaker at the bottom, the audio output on the Galaxy M31 is decent but not rich enough.3. It doesn't come with earphones.4. It comes with a 15W type-c charger. It goes from 10 to 100 percent levels in about two hours. As per same price rahge competitors they could have given at least 25W or so.Conclusion:-If you are looking for a phone with best battery backup, good camera quality, best SAmoled display available in price range and a decent processor to handle day to day use with Samsung brand value.Regards,Yash

  The phone is decent at this price point . I don't like the phone too much,as it has samsung branding so I expect more but at this price many phone available better than this but it's battery backup & display quality is best. But it's not a gaming phone, I don't like the Exynos processer for gaming. Overall good but not recommended for gaming & heavy usages. The main thing it's camera , it has 4 camera but don't think it's too good but I like the selfi camera which I mostly used. Best for old generation people.

  Decided to buy samsung phone after using all known chinese brands like vivo,oppo etc in last 5 years. But after using for 15 days realized why samsung lost market share rapidly to the chinese players. The phone has the same issues tht samsung used to have 5 years back like getting changed,features like adaptive brightness doesnt work and pictures with 64 megapixel camera  leaves white patches on the face.phone has a lag and not fast .samsung seriously needs to review its product quality otherwise customers will surely dump it and go for Chinese brands

"
"

  It's an upgrade to the M30s. The screen is good with a raindrop camera. The Super Amoled display is quite good to use even while at outdoors.The massive 6000 mah battery easily gives backup upto 1.5 days on moderate to heavy usage.It takes around 2 hours 40 mins to 3 hours on initial charging from zero to 100 percent.For Gamers there a Game Booster App.The camera is also quite good with lots of options to choose from.Cons:The phone has some bloatwares, some from samsung, and some third party like Helo app. Some apps like fb can only be disabled.Overall a Good Phone, and the massive 6000mah battery is really good for moderate to heavy users.

  All the features are  performing well""Fingerprint reader"" ,""Battery life"",""Camera qualityThe photos taken by phone are as same as taken from DSLR.Battery life is so good it just takes an hour to full charge my phone.And I am enjoying all the features of the phone

  Very good product. I read about the concerns on the camera but still decided to go ahead. The mobile is fantastic. Camera, OS everything is good. This was my first online purchase of this value and had concerns there. But was delighted as everything went smooth. There was a delivery OTP provided by Amazon hence the delivery person had to deliver to me in person which was good. I was worried that he shouldn't leave it with security in my absence. 2nd, the seller had packed it nicely, the primary pack seal by the manufacturer was intact hence a genuine new pack. Overall, had a great experience - product, delivery and the  seller.

  It has issue with proximity sensor. While calling screen keep on and off and you will face issue of call on hold, call recording, over heating, battery drainage etc.It is worst fon in my life.if you can use ear phone while call, then only you should buy it.When you keep your phone on ear while calling, screen should get off so that there should not be any accidental touch . But while talking most of the time screen turns back on... SO then your ear will touch the screen and the postion of menu and then call hold or recording option clicked.I checked with service center and also share video but they could not fix it. I submitted my phone to service center 2 times but issue is still there. They are saying it is due to location of proximity sensor in this model.Now I have no option.

  Its almost 3 months now. Giving review about this phone:PROS:1) Made In India, in Noida factory.2) Very good touch screen. You don't require screen guard, as its scratch resistant/scratch free.3) Superb battery life.4) Doesn't get heated after prolonged use.CONS:1) It doesn't have block number feature with prefix pattern. You have to add individual numbers. E.g. you know call starting with 140 are all advertisement calls. You can't ignore them simply by adding 140*, you have to individually add. Trucaller has this feature, but you require to install this 3rd party APP.2) SAMSUNG claims its a 15W charger. But if you know Wattage is Volt X Current. Its 5V, 2A charger, that is 10W. In short its weaker charger than what company claims.3) Its touch screen is very sensitive. If soap water etc gets on to the screen then even after cleaning by cloth, screen doesn't respond for long time. ""Accidental touch feature"" if you put ON then especially you get into this issue.Overall:Overall for this range with brand like SAMSUNG, its definately a good BUY. Much better than Chinese phones.

  Having used the best Galaxy devices till date, thought of checking this out too. Clearly a slow to respond, with glitches inapp and feels much inferior in quality than my C9 Pro which i used until recently. Those on a budget, can definitely try though... waiting for the S20...

  √√√√ I LOVE --Wide viewing angles-Excellent in the segment-Awesome battery backup-Good display-Far better than redmi and realme-A 6000 mah battery 128gb external memory & quad camera-Worth every single penny of your hard earning-Best part is the u display &round corners of m31-The large screen improves movie experience, gallery display and pics collection. Very impressive, i love it.-A night mode camera is there to improve your photography experience.

  I purchased this mobile based on previous Samsung galaxy mobile experience. Now i've mixed feelings on it.These are my observations after single day use.1. Rear camera quality is extraordinary unless you zoom it.2. Front camera isn't that great. Beauty mode is always on and photos are patchy.3. Samsung KNOX isn't preinstalled. So, you can't use ""Secure Folder"". Need to install ""S Secure"" app for app lock.4. Guesture screenshot didn't work.5. Phone is slightly heated while updating and installing apps.6. OS is so smooth.7. Fingerprint reader unlocks the mobile swiftly.Update: after multiple days of regular use1. So far battery lasts almost 2 days with regular usage. Like YouTube, Facebook and etc.,2. Though it's of 6GB ram, I noticed lag and phone stuck frequently.3. Front cam needs a lot of improvement4. Call quality isn't that great5. You can hear full voice only when tye voulme is completely up or almost full. Same applies to earphones as well.Verdict: Go with this mobile if you're expecting a good rear camera and better battery performance.

  Pathetic product delivered, phone set delivered on 16th March & i have gifted it on 23rd March, when the phone is switched on, phone touch not working, keypad not working, so many time requested for replacement, Amazon least bothered to acknowledge it, nor I have got confirmation for replacement, when we call customer care they say lock down, understand , my question is why amazon not accepting requests for replacement, I have requested for replacement( on 23r March 2020 )  before return window closed ( I e on 26th March 2020)

  Edit: The third pic shows you what I had to go through, to get the phone repaired from Samsung service centre!! No social distancing, and many were not wearing masks properly! Read on...I wondered how Samsung is able to sell these mobiles (M series) at such an affordable prices competing with Mi, Oppo, and Vivo! Now I know the secret, it is done by lowering the “quality”! The M31 I bought for my sister did not last even a couple of months! It started as a small blue “dot” at the left corner and grown to an “inch wide” blue patch on the screen! Boom, within a week, you can not see anything on the screen except for that bluish patch that spread across. See the images.When we visited the Samsung service centre, traveling for about 80kms, the reception was extremely poor and rude! The person standing at the store entrance said “this is not covered under warranty” without even having a technician checking what is the problem! Basically looks like they are all trained to say that line. When we insisted to check what is the problem, the technician checked and told that there is a leak of the display liquid inside the screen and is due to a damage caused by a small pin (apparently it is a very minor one, that can be seen only with the technician magnifying glasses), that we never understood. Another thing I noticed is, most of the people at the service centre are with their “Samsung M series” mobiles in hand, which confirmed that this series is manufactured with low quality hardware and people have a lot of complaints about them!!We had to give the phone for display replacement, that costed us another ~6K on top of the 17K we spent for this! I could have bought Oneplus Nord by spending another 5K on top!! Waste of money and time 😑😑😑It’s a clear no to buy Samsung M Series!!!

  if you are purchasing forCamera - you can do better than this.Games - you can do much better.Battery life - even this will do , please do not expect miracles from 6000 figure.Phone , map , whats app or lots of apps ( productive apps not entertainment types ) at this cost with nice to touch feel - yes this is the phone you should consider.Screen - please buy this , screen image quality is so good , even a dull photo looks good.Phone looks - nothing jazzy , plain and simple15W charging is okay not fast types and when charging 6000 battery is like back to old school.Sound - a bit weak but its okay if you become DJ just once in two months.Software or bloatware - Samsung have better and useful products which all are not provided with this model as its a mid range but what all is given in not sufficient but with that kind of RAM and storage , go get how many do you like.Charger is not small but charging cable isGorilla glass is effectivePhone is not slim but far from uncomfortable.

  I have been using this phone for quite some time now and I consider myself eligible to review it. Initially, I was very confused if I should be going for M21 or M31 but glad that I chose the latter.Pros:Excellent quad camera and front cameraThe battery lasts for 1.5 days with minimal gamingUI is really cool compared to other Chinese brandsMade in India & most importantly the majority of the parts are not from ChinaCons:Charging takes time (approx 2.5 - 3hrs) considering it is 6000 mah batteryBuild quality could have been better (all plastic)Charger wire is shorter compared to all the other brands which I used earlierTips:Charge your phone in airplane mode and it will be quickerBuy tempered glass on Amazon only as offline tempered glasses from the roadside are not good and will hamper the clarity of the screenBack case is recommended as the phone is prone to scratchesPurchased Boxxo tempered glass from Amazon along with Valueactive carbon filter back case. Both are good and protect your phone to a great extent and also enhances its looks

  Samsung Galaxy M31 did resonate to me, with another ‘M31’ - Andromeda Galaxy.In the universe of mobile-phones, Samsung M31 is a star in the galaxy of its kind.Why Samsung?Intrinsically, I am a fan of Samsung products.Excellent product design and manufacturing. Highly reliable. It was time to change my old 3G Samsung mobile. Finally I settled for this one.Why M31?In my professional life, I worked on R&D, and fabrication of VLSIs. That made me a perfectionist in the field of photography. So  I was looking for an affordable mobile phone as an aid to my DSLRs. This M31 met all my expectations.The Samsung M31.The high-resolution front and quad-camera system at the rear. Excellent exposure sytem. Brilliant colour rendition. All these through world class Samsung display.The hardware is perfectly matched with its operating syste. I was amazed using its never-used-before features. I found, there's more than one way to peel an apple. With its 6000 mAh battery the phone is very thin and light. Finally, true value for money.

  It has Only two minus point....1st is its thickness is high....and second is poor build quality...looks like 10K phones....overall performance is good

  I have upgraded my mobile from m30s to m31.Yesterday i got this mobile.after being use for 32 hrs .I have noticed many flaws in this mobile1.Very poor network.Internet speed is dead slow .no constant network .I checked my sim with my old m30s.pretty decent coverge and good net speed .But with m31 very poor unsustained network.2.Battery is 6000 Mah but doest seems like 6000mah.M30s has better battery capacity discharge than m31.in m31 after a full charge when internet is used continuously it last for just 5 to 6 hrs .I never faced this problem with m30s .In m30s battery will remain for atleast 12 to 16hrs on usage.But in M31 very disappointed3.It has better Ram but doest seems to be that worth.6gm ram but i got hanged 4 times while using and  5 times my app crashed(app stopped working).Till now in M30s i never faced this issue.One the 1st day of usage itself im veryyy veryyy disappointed.Replacement requested,need to wait for 10 more days to get it replaced as they are out of stock.My request is go for m30s it is cheaper than m31 and also better than m31 .

  Amazing phone..Knock knock knock Sabka baap aaya... ♥️♥️🇮🇳🇮🇳

  This review is for users who mostly use mobile for calls, watching videos, some social media and photography!!Looks: This phone is Huge! For watching videos it is fun but handling it can be tricky... Plastic back is fingerprint magnet so cover is recommended.Screen: stunner! Big screen + amoled is great combination! Display is bright and Sunlight visibility also fine. Ambient light sensor works as expected.Always on display and double tap to wake up are handy features.Battery: it works as it should be! Typically lasts for 2 days with moderate usage.Few hours of youtube, long calls and even video calls(no gameplays)I am using it for a week now with 2 simcards.Charging is fast but due to huge battery takes long time if battery goes below 20%(Generally avoid draining phone to lower levels to maintain battery health and also to shorten charging time.)Performance: Everything works fine. animations are buttery smooth. RAM managements looks good. It's been only one week so i will update later if anything changes.Camera: Lovely! The main 64MP clicks only in 3:4 aspect ration but it is really crisp.Attached some sample shots.Macro lens surprised me! It is actually pretty useful and captures minute details, viole reproduction is also apt.Wide angle camera: This one i felt just ok! It should be minimum 13MP to give justice to details.Selfie cam: 32MP is more than sufficient! Clicks beautiful images. There are many things which selfie lovers might like.Video recording: stability is good. In low light it struggled little bit but overall no complaints. Hyperlapse and super slow modes are fun!Summary: If you want a mobile for your multimedia needs with long lasting battery, great display, fantastic cameras and Non China Brand you can trust this device!(Interestingly device came with Helo app preinstalled which is banned by govt. Had to uninstall it manually)

  2 STAR TO 4 STARDEAR ALLIM writing the review after usage of Samsang M31 after one month. The below review was written after 2-3 days of usage of same. But after 1 month I chage my mind and believe it's one of good phone cader. Not bad as wat I have written below( my early review)Battery back up is too good and performance wise to its a MONSTER. Camera too good. The only area in which the phone lage is loud speaker. That they have to improve.👍👍👍👍🤳Thx allMy early review👇Very much Disappointed  with the product M31 I was previously  using MI A2. I bought this after so much research from review from Amazon.  The major disappointment was with speakers both loud speakers & phone speakers  quality  is not at all acceptable. Very cheap sounds never ever I used it before in my entire life time.I play free fire ( only game I have in my mobile)In MIA2 (6GB Ram ,128 storage ) I never got up hang my mobile. But in case of M31 (8GB RAM 128 STORAGE) I got hang every time 🤣🤣🤣If you have other options plz go for it. I will never come back to Samsung in my life time.I hesitate to go for redmi before I  buy MiA2. This time too I thought to for Mi. Still gone for Samsung. But it proved me wrong.

  Hello All..I'm writing this review after few months of usage, but this should not be different as per my experience. I feel this instrument is having all necessary features in this price range for those who believe in smart work and nice user interface.I liked the most..- Android 10! Latest looks & works Beautiful...ahead of all- One UI is the superb experience as compared to other ones which are cheap. Feel the REAL look and damn useful features required for what is called as SMART WORK- Dark Mode is the best feature I wish for- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.- Performance is good. No heating or lagging.- 6000 mh battery is BIG- Both dedicated sim slots support VoLTE...i really appreciate this- The Mobile Mic and speaker is good and clear- Camera is really good.  Video stabilization option is excellent- Face unlock, figure-print sensor response is quickAdditional requirement- I wish Samsung should provide a screen guard and back cover along with the handset. This is very good business trend and customer convenience. This will also help to protect the instrument from Day1 of usage.Finally the icing on the cake is..If you are thinking to buy a new phone, you can always consider this on priority being proudly Made In India. The day is not so away...MONSTER will surely beat the DRAGON

  ** Good or bad, Bot tells the truth **+ Good phone in this budget. There is no significant advantage to spend 10K extra on the M51+ Good camera in day light.+ Ok performance for apps. Display is sharp and responsive.+ Fast fingerprint reader. Lets you switch on the display without pressing any button. This increases the life of the power button.+ Good grip and round edges, feels good to hold the phone.+ Fast shipping, got it within 3 days.- Average camera in low light.- Display is too long and less wide, so youtube experience is compromised for full screen.- Default wallpapers have very low resolution, makes you fee the display is not good.- Battery is 6000 mAH but the backup time is only marginally higher than my 3000 mAH Samsung J7.- When I opened the packaging, the phone was already in switched on position and some extra apps were already installed. There was a small single scratch on the display as well. So do not expect a fresh piece when you order.- Annoying UI that will take time to get used to. Samsung should have opted for stock Android.

  I ordered the phone on 5th March'20 and got on 8th March'20 as promised by Amazon I had been using this phone for past 3 days. Kindly find my review below.Pros:Amazing battery. Single charge for 2 days minimum.Screen clarity is good. SAMOLED displayProcessor speed is ok.Played PUBG for continous 3 hours. Battery drained by 10% only.Phone is light weight.Wifi calling.5G wifi support.Loved this dark mode.Samsung VPN.Cons:Heating up issues as in all Galaxy M series.Camera quality is average.Full charge requires 2 hrs.Finally 15,999 for Samsung is ok to buy.

"

  I orderded 8 GB ram with 128 GB storage. Seriously, samsung is doing remarkable in this segment. I was Iphone user and seriously I purchased this phone to get more handy with android OS.Camera: Too good. Many options and works in almost all condition.Sound: Dolby supports to Bluetooth and wired headphones. AmazingDisplay: No competition.. sAMOLED is doing its best. The contrast is such black even you cant make difference between the body black color and the screen black color. Phone looks very nice when I use dark mode.Battery: Monster battery, full usage will give you 1 and half day life. if average use then it will last for 2 days.Charging Cable: it is only 0.5 Meter, Samsung why why are you giving such small length wire? how much are you saving 50 INR? Also i found the charging cable is with poor quality.No Case: Generally silicon case we get by 150 INR outside, samsung would have given it then it was good. but its not there in box.Overall this product is superb choise if you have budget under 20K (for this variant of 8GB RAM 128 GN Storage)

"
"

   Everything is okey except below:1) Camera is getting blurry when you fully zoom for long distance images. It should not happen if its 64MP and one of its USP2) Speaker volume is very Low3) Can not split display while you are already on another app4) Can not connect internet through WPS5) Poor in facelock sensor6) Palm swipe to capture screen shot is not working always.. It should be 100% accurate then only it works..Rest all superb with this price

"
"

  It's really good device. Battery is a freaking beast, amoled display is beautiful and UI is very slick and simple. I got nothing to complaint considering what I paid for it. I would never buy crappy Xiaomi phones with its obscene notifications. Go for samsung phones, they don't push anything vulgar with their phones.

  I had been waiting to buy this smartphone since its launch. It has been a couple of days using it and I am very satisfied with the experience. The fingerprint reader unlocks the phone in a jiffy. The battery lasted over a day with moderate to high usage, including surfing, watching YouTube videos, using Spotify and making two long calls. It took me 2 hours to charge the phone from 20 to 100%, which is decent considering that the charger is a 15W one. The camera quality is really good, and although I have only taken photos of my answer scripts so far, I am looking forward to taking more photos with it. The processor is also great and it has been able to handle moderate levels of multitasking with ease. The display is bright and vibrant, and the sound quality is really good. Overall, it checks all the boxes, and makes it a true tool for the user.I would definitely recommend this phone to anyone who is looking for a decent budget phone. In this range it is definitely the mega monster that it claims to be.

  Camera: 3.8/5Battery: 5/5UI: 5/5Fingerprint reader: 4/5Screen: 5/5The first and foremost reason to buy it is that its not a China brand. Had a Mi phone which stopped working after 7 months had to visit service centre to replace battery which has warranty of 6 months. Charged me Rs.1880 for it. After raise issue to Mi CS atleast they refunded my Rs. 524.Now, about M31 if you looking for decent phone with Amoled screen and bigger battery this the phone for you.For some people not having glass body may feel like a deal breaker but for me whi has used a glass body phone with back cover doesn't feel like much difference, phone is 90% of time in back cover.Camera id descent for thus price range, won't  say the best but gives satisfactory results and quad camera setup many more options to play with.Samsung needs to upgrade from 9611 processor but still for a user like me it doesn't  make any difference.Any body looking to buy a new phone can wait and buy M31s which has a better charging and screen.

  I am using my new phone for almost a month now. The phone looks great and value for money to me. The delivery of Amazon was perfect. I will list down the pros and cons below:Pros1. Battery life of the phone is awesome. On medium usage it lasts for 2 days. The charging time is 2.5 hours though, which a bit high for charging 6000mAh battery.2. Screen, colors and resolution all are a masterclass.  Samsung and its screen are the best thing to have. There is some bezel in the screen and I didn't like the idea of curving screen at the corners. It is manageable though.3. Touch and keypad are good and responsive.Cons1. Processor on the slower side. Good for its category but definitely not the best.2. I didn't like the build quality of the phone.  While the shape is sharp and finish is good, I find the phone little bit bulky.3. The menu and options are not the most user friendly. I used an Oxygen os before and believe me it was much smooth in sorting things.

  Best smartphone in this budget.It has 4 rear camera with 64 mp main features.Selfies had good impressions due to 32 mp front camera. No need to press buttons for selfy.Very smooth display.Sound quality ok.But in headphones very good quality.Only one issue is NFC connectivity is not available.Rest every thing super.

  Got SG M31 more than a week ago. Ran into issues. Got in touch with CC and Tech support. They arranged a tech visit. Tech visit confirmed issues with the phone -- a replacement was done. Got a smooth working phone now and I have no complaints. Infact I want to thank all those involved in getting me  a replacement.Now for the phone itself. Big display--good display--but not HDR enabled though Vivid color setting does a pretty good job. I am not the Cheapo kind who takes selfies and uses a lot of Tik Tok so camera is not a big deal for me But the camera  is real good HDR pics are nice and slow mo and time lapse are amazing. Live focus is a amazing feature in camera. Sound quality is awesome and better than redmi note 6 pro which i was using earlier. Good snappy phone for daily app usage. I don't waste my time on games so no comments. UI is good with ease of use all around. Love the AOD display.Bought a sandisk type C usb otg but it didnt show in storage. Maybe I dont know how to use it. Overall a good phone and highly recommended. Happy bought a made in India phone will sell my old redmi note 6 pro to some anti-national.

  Many people have written a lot about this phone. So let me give you my quick observation:1. Screen is good, but has yellow tint. People used to super bright screens will not like it.2. The max brightness is also not as much as other good quality phones.3. Battery life is ok at best. But that is because of Samsung os. You can enable it to kill more apps to preserve battery.4. Samsung one os is ok ok. Lacks many things in 2020! Scrollable wallpapers missing on home screen. Sms and calling app look outdated. App launcher is also ok ok. No issues have installed nova launcher. Can also recommend lawnchair.5. Sar value is low, so range is not max always. Some basic issues with wifi tooHope samsung will fix color tint issue and other os issues.So at almost 20k not worth it. But hey I bought it because it is not a Chinese phone. So extra money spent on nationalism. Jai Hind!

  Yes, the phone turns out to be knocking in terms of battery and other functionalities are also fine except wifi. Whenever i switch the phone on i have to manually open the wifi settings to connect it to the auto-connected wifi which had already saved. I don't know this is an issue with my handset or everyone, haven't contacted CC in this regard as not a huge issue. The main thing processor and ram management is also fine as mated with 8gb, but it's not meant for heavy gaming. As i play pubg and all.. fame do drop sometimes as i've noticed, which was not the story with my asus 5z 8gb variant, i miss that phone.But in terms of battery it's surely a deal breaker! It's only bout 2 weeks with me.. will update here if find out something new. Uptill now thanks to amazon and samsung!

  Samsung Shut them all by this ..The true smartphone...it is even learning by my habits & deliver the expected results day by day.. Samsung One UI helps you in almost each & everything (AI Factor)Don't believe so called Reviewers in YouTube. They don't tell you all Truths..they are only there to Promote China..just have faith in Samsung it will never disappoint you in any aspect.My Experience:-Finger Print -Absolutely FastFace Unlock -FastBattery- Never DiesCamera- Exactly like one should be like 64MPProcessing Power -Easly Beating Snapdragon 712What else one should need.Heavy Gaming :- Spend atleast 32,000 & go somewhere else.Yes Delivery- Hassel Free, Amazon Shows it is a ""Brand"".

  This mobile has 6000mah battery but it last only one day.camera is not so good according to it megapixels.fingerprint some times not working but almost good.display and touch is good. The major problem is it's hanging. I am using this phone for last 45 days and it hangs 3 to 4 times and it takes 5 to 10 minutes and some times more to start working after hanging.i have Faith on Samsung but this hanging problem annoying me badly.Samsung needs to improve this issues.All other things are good.

  This is a short review after the first 24 hours of the M31 6GB 128GB black color phone I have bought. I had shortlisted Redmi9 pro max and this one as my top 2 choices for a 17000 or less phone. I opted for M31 for its 6000mah battery, oled screen and great camera. I am not a high end gamer but I do create a lot of memes, videos and posts for my social media. First 24 hours, this phone rocks  (my last phone is a Moto G4 plus). No heating issues. Screen is too good. Battery after 24 hours of hectic usage is still 40% remaining. 15w charger is not ultra fast but quite decent. Overall a great purchase decision. I will replace my other MotoG5 plus with this soon. Instead of spending 30k on one phone,  buy two at 15-16k each. This strategy has worked for me very well. What's most fascinating part about the last 24 hours is the Samsung app that moved some 28 GB of data files from my Moto in no time, effortlessly.  This is huge.So should you buy M31? Unless you are a high end gamer the answer is YES.

  worthless phone excessive heating the phone heats up like iron. the radiations level of the phone are above standard planning to launch a complaint against Samsung under product liability 2019 and cpa 1986....Amazon for supporting this kind of crappy product for sale.... you all the dealer Samsung and importer who is also liable for not declaring information required under law....

  Worst ever phone any one can buy ...really shameful that these type of third grade products are being sold on Amazon. I ordered a Samsung phone on 14th March it was defective so a replacement was sought on 20 th march but due to lockdown andreturn pickups not happening it could not happen finally Amazon person came in JUNE but refused to replace it as its outer cover was not there I pleaded but he refused to budge I was left with a defective piece so went to service center my phones camera ,Jack, battery have been replaced but still issues are there , a brand new phone turned out to be a dud...really shocking even now battery drains too quickly...in this price range many phones are available please dont go for it ..worst ever purchase with zero service from both amazon and samsung .P.s - there service  center will keep on saying that no parts are available and will keep your phone for around a week. So have another phone ready with you as you will need it.My honest advice dont buy this phone.

  Battery: 10/10Display: 10/10Sound: 10/10 (Don't expect stereo effect sound at this price. The Dolby Atmos effect that you get through the earphones is however appreciable.)Look & Feel: 9/10 (It has a plastic back, but at this price, a plastic back is justifiable).Camera: 9/10 (I am not a big fan of cellphone camera, but intial impression is 9/10.)User Experience: 9/10 (The phone does not lag as of 5 days of usage. I have disabled most of the Samsung apps, but still few Samsung apps can't be uninstalled or disabled.)

  This phone is a winner. Absolutely stunning camera @64 MP. Excellent battery life, still running after extensive excitement use by my daughter. Biometric scans both face and fingerprint work well. Video quality is excellentAwesome cost.The only drawback Galaxy store works well, the play store doesn’t.

"
"

  Too much bloat ware (useless and forced apps by Samsung)  is shipped along with the phone, if you are not expert at playing with the settings it would be tough to remove it’s forced live screen wallpapers and disable other blot ware.Video recording from front camera will be flipped, there is a toggle switch to record without flipped but it doesn’t work always. 8GB RAM etc are I think just for the specs, it just feels like a  2GB phone when using it.I bought this phone to do away with Chinese brands but disappointed finally.Chinese brands do perform a lot better for the same price range. It could be because they use Qualcomm SoCs (System on Chip). Samsung uses its own SoC for most of its entry level and economical phones.

"
"

   I feel to stop buying products from amazon & I decided never to buy any Samsung mobile( View the Video I've attached )Just used the mobile for 15 days facing so many issues, this is the worst phone I ever used in my life. This mobile deserves all negative feedback.M31 Mega Fraud, Mega Useless & Mega Waste of Money.I'LL BE THANKFUL TO AMAZON IF THEY REFUND MY MONEY OR REPLACE THIS USELESS MOBILE.Note:- I gave 1 star just because of amazon's marketing trick, they not allowing to proceed the feedback with Zero star rating. THIS MOBILE PURELY DESERVES ""ZERO STAR RATING"".

  Using this mobile for  almost 2 months now. Just before lockdown i bought it and it started hanging within a week so i wasn't able to place an exchange or return order complaint. The battery life is also very less as compared to other mobile phones I've used. Plus it mentions 6000mah which it definitely not at all acceptable. Also it starts to heat up pretty quickly and then you'll not be able to use your phone for another 30 mins. Not at all satisfied with the product.

"
"

  An average phone with decent features that are usually available with any Samsung Mobile.What i didn't like -1. High battery charging time of over 2hrs for 100%2. Phone heats up quite quickly. Upgraded OS and right on day 1, it got heated up during the upgrade3. Poor quality camera - but can't expect more from a 18k mobile4. Large and bulky - poor design- again, can't expect more at that price5. Performance isn't greatOnly good things1. Display - good for that price and size2. It is Samsung!What am I comparing with? Oppo, Poco & Samsung A series.Have always been using Flagship mobiles and this one was just a secondary mobile for home, yet it is not quite exciting.

"
"

  I bought the mobile in the first day of its release and writing this review after almost 3 months.For a normal user without gaming and all..,Pros:1.  Good battery backup2.  Good display and hence we can watch movies and series also in this.Cons:1. Very dangeruos to use without screen guard or case. Display got broke on the second day and when I went to Samsung service centre.., they said the charge for changing display is Rs. 5500. which is very costly.2.  Cant use it in one hand and the sensitivity is so high that even before pressing BACK button.., when typing something automatically that gets executed and it goes to a different screen. We get irritated all the time that happens3. Face unlock is not up to the mark.In a sentence, I am not a satisfied customer because of the above issues.

  Editing after using few days. Don't trust samsung. I have used so far 2 models. All flop.Lot many issues in this model - Camera shots coming blank.Bluetooth not working smoothly. Its braking in just 2 mtr away speaker. Other phone I had it was super fantastic iPhone old though. It was working if its 10mtrs also.Facebook watch videos flickering. Need to close all n open again to view from scratch.Buggy and  bulky model.Dislike same old UI icons. Bulky design like old mobiles. Camera is fantastic. Got screen glitch while playing preinstalled games. That shows some issue in software.Also Samsung fircebly adding few unneccessary games app in build which is not needed. Not able to figure out how to stop those popup alerts.

  I faced problems from day one. When I opened the box and was trying to charge the phone adapter was not working. 2nd day I went to service centre and they replaced the adapter. Battery is drying fast while it is 6000 mah. I thought there is some issue with the new phone but due to lockdown I did not went to service centre for battery problem. I am facing issue every time sometime it is restarting suddenly, due to lockdown will Amazon exchange my phone with the new one or Service Centre will replace my phone. I do not want this phone it will create lots of technical problem in future. So please replace the phone.

"
"

  After using the phone for 3 months, i am writing this review.Pros:- Battery backup- Dual 4G Dual WiFi calling- High Quality LED Display- Camera in HDR mode- Sleek design- SpeedCons:- initially had restarting issues, later resolved after software update- Heats up on long video calls and battery drains fast due to high quality video- Camera could have been better, zooms in digital mode, not optical- Security lock function for each app not availableOverall an excellent phone at this price range with an excellent battery backup. You cannot expect a DSLR clarity for this price even if you have a 128 pixel in Digital zoom.If you are willing to buy only for a high quality camera, not a good choice. I have attached some shots, you can have a look and decide. Otherwise i am happy with my purchase 6 GB RAM & 128 GB Storage with a pretty good speed of operations.Mangal S

  I chose to purchase this because of two things : The display, having already used the M30. And, the humongous 6000mAH Battery.As for the battery, I have received something even better. The m31 display is an upgrade over the M30. I don't know if I am wrong, but it is more crisp and has better contrast.But however I am disappointed with the battery. Even though it is 1000 mAh higher capacity, I have not noticed any significant difference over M30.But this is again compensated by a far better camera than the M30. The M30 camera was pathetic to say the least.This is however not as good as a realme or redmi. But, the display is light years better than the realmes or mis.

"
"

  Starting with display as its sAMOLED its great.Camera 64MP main shooter is awesome, great details and color reporduction , slefie is nice too, ultra wide depth and macro works as described but main highlght is 64 MP which actualy is great.Battery life is superb but takes 2:30+ to charge from 10 to 100.Perfomance of 9611 is very nice, it does not lag in daily uses. PUBG in HD and ultra or HD smooth works very good for long hours of play. HDR with ultra lags sometimes. But HD ultra is the best setting for 1 hour of gaming.Last is build quality, i have blue and i thought it might look cheap plastic as seen in pictures , but blue looks semi premium , its not thick or bulky, when u have in hand its great.it does not have NFC so if you are in use of it then go for A51 else M31 is actualy a good deal . Totaly worthit and plus  samsung brand. Also note samsung has improved  a lot in updates. Plus no advertisements.

  Dont comes with headphone,back case cover. Battery is not good enough,only if you dont use internet then only it goes correctly. But i have nokia smartphone which offers 3500mah battery, which runs pubg smoothly and last battery for one and half day. Love for nokia , hate for samsung.

"
"

  1. Price:The price for which the smartphone is available is much more affordable and more featureful than any other competitors.2. Battery:The battery really supprts the tagline monster battery which really helps the phone to last atleast 2 days of battery backup.3. Specifications :The price bracket for the smartphone offered the specs is more powerful than the others.4. Product Quality:The sturdiness of smartphone is really good and the case provided in the box really helps the phone to be more safe.5. Camera:The camera offers quad camera setup which is also more brighter in night and ultra wide features help me get all in one frame, and quality is also really very good.Overall Screen, Specifications, Build Quality is remarkable made by Samsung.

  Having owned a top range galaxy S8 which did not live upto its quality, I was pretty sure I did not want to spend a ruppee more than 15-16k of my hard earned money. Clearly did not want a Chinese brand so opted for this one and boy I am surprised by the specs, battery, screen resolution, camera, overall performance you name it. Speaker quality is okay but if you use headphone for music or watching your latest show this will be of your least concern. You will need a phone cover coz the polycarbonate is definitely a fingerprint magnet.When phone like these can address all your needs then why to spend crazy amount of money ? Usse accha Sensex mein daalo appreciation hoga:) Be prudent.

  With all the chinese non-chinese phones thing going on, I decided to go for SAMSUNG which is made in India and it sure has disappointed me.✘ Phones charging port has started acting up within 2 months. It's charging intermittently.✘ Have not exposed the phone to bad weather or anything. The person using this has been at home during these times✘ Tried different cable, plugpoint, charger, etc. Nothing seems to work. Seems like the phone's charging port has gone bad.Apart from the charging port issue, here are some more cons✘ The camera quality is very bad. Just increasing megapixels doesn't help.✘ Front camera feels like VGA camera

"

  VALUE BUYING **** (for me)Good NON-CHINESE mobileOverall performance is good but for INR 17500/- Processor chipset can be improved and didn't like the back design and builtin quality - can be metal. I got this mobile in the exchange for my old Redmi Note 3. So, for me value buying.But, if you see, in this pandemic situation (COVID19) and geopolitical scenario, when India is planning to ban Chinese Products, Samsung has a great opportunity to acquire Indian Market and can deliver flagship mobiles by reducing the price.Pros:1. Display2. Battery backup3. Wide-angle camera pictures4. Dolby Atmos is a good experienceCons: 1. BUILTIN QUALITY (made up of plastic) -->> could be metal built2. As per the price range, PROCESSOR CAN BE IMPROVED.3. AGGRESSIVE PRICING4. The back should be glass5. Camera performance can be improved in low light condition#ChinaKoJawaab #wallet_power

  I am using this phone almost for three months and it's performance is promising so far !Fingerprint sensor is very responsiveFace unlock knows how to do his job preety well !Gaming is upto the mark !Can play Asphalt 9 on highest level without any sweat!PUBG ? You know the rest (Fabulous preformance)Battery is massive and works almost 1 and a half days after using it heavyly (approx for 10 hrs straight!!)About the camera ,it has some cons in somePicture modes for example,In the mode of wide angle, when we capture photo in low light it has plenty of noise in it, when we use normal slow motion mode the recorded clip shows some lags, stuttering. But that's fixable by further software update so hope Samsung will fix that soon!Except that the device is Masterpiece in such a good price !

  Phone is ok.Battery is good enough, this is the only plus point.Face detection does not work very poor,OTG is very good, Doc. Files transferred open directly without going through any app.Keyboard features not good in comparison to Google.Camera quality is very bad, white light turns blue, good pictures turn out very deep coloured.Palm screen shot does not work so the time.Adaptive screen doesn't work.Phone is slow.Power on off is missing.Plastic back cover gets scratched very fast.Videos plays in 2 steps, one in off volume.Samsung phones are not good for gear S2 watches, it connects through Samsung galaxy store which which does not show all the faces as In other phones & it also does not show the purchased watch faces.There is a feature of Zip apps, which is of no use bcoz if you zip an app you can't use it, so what's the purpose of zipping? And after unzipping apps get lost.Photo editor is not good enough,,,

"
"

  Charging time of phone is more than 5-6 hours. But battery drains like a normal 3000 mah one. Nothing monster about it. And amazon support is worst, they are not returning the phone even within 4 days of purchase. Samsung customer care executives are telling me to come to service centre, why did I buy a phone if I had to go to service centre with 4 day of purchase.  Phone hangs even if you use Instagram for 30 min. Bad processor.

"
"

  Battery life is great as it easily lasts for over 48 hrs of usage in single charge. Vibrant colours - probably the best and refreshing colour combinations (especially in the dark mode) for menus and adaptive colour and brightness settings are top notch. Smart and smooth UI is simple to use and highly responsive, Samsung has added some of the new cool features to the UI which are very useful. Fast processor (I am not a gamer) functions without any lag. Camera quality is Fantastic in good light conditions including the front camera, the picture taken are very close to their natural colours. Overall an excellent value for money. Go for it. Highly recommended.

"
"

  Never expected such kind of cheap product from Samsung. Both  Cameras are not only below the standard but really really cheap in quality. Have used for few hours before throwing it back.

"
"

  Phone has a .massive battery as stated by Samsung 6000mah capacity.  But trust me it's useless. Battery backup in average moderate usage will not last even a complete full day by the end of the your battery percentage will be around 15 to 20. Which is really disappointing.  Trust me my honor 8x mobile with just 3450 mah battery gives a similar back up. What is the point of buying such a phone then. Camera is good. Low light capture is efficient enough at this price range. Finger print sensor is okay. Not great as my honor 8x has a lightning fast finger 3sensor when compared to Samsung. Also I found a sense of lag in the UI when going through the phone like pressing the back button for returning etc.  Samsung need to fix the bug for battery drain its drains like crazy. Disappointed with the battery.

  At first glance,this smartphone is having sport big 6.4-inch displays with waterdrop notches, which Samsung calls Infinity U displays,Galaxy M31 up and it feels comfortable to hold in the handSamsung Galaxy M31 specifications and featuresThe display on the Galaxy M31 is exactly the same size and resolution. You are getting a 6.4-inch Full HD Plus Super Infinity-U display. Even though both phones use the same screen technology, somehow the display on the Galaxy M31 is better than on the Galaxy M30s.Samsung Galaxy M31 performanceThe fingerprint scanner is quick to unlock the smartphone, and the selfie camera does a decent job with face recognition. We enjoyed watching content on the AMOLED display. There is Widevine L1 support which should let you stream full-HD contentSamsung Galaxy M31 camerasThe Galaxy M31 sports a quad-camera setup at the back and a single 32-megapixel selfie shooter. The primary camera on the Galaxy M31 has a 64-megapixel resolution and f/1.8 aperture. This camera takes 16-megapixel binned shots by default but you can switch to the full resolution. There's also an 8-megapixel ultra-wide-angle camera with a 123-degree field of view and an f/2.2 aperture. The other two are a 5-megapixel depth sensor and a 5-megapixel macro camera

  I am using Samsung Galaxy M31 last 10 days. I feel I made best choice this time.1. Android v10.0 OS with 2.3GHz + 1.7GHz Exynos 9611 Octa core processor really good performance. No lagging.2. Excellent Display. Blue ligth filter is cool.3. 6000 mah battery is very usefull for continuous user like me. Fast charging & no heating problem.4. Camera is good. Macro performance is very good. Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160.5. Both dedicated sim slots support LTE.6. Mobile speakers sound is good but when I use earphone I am not getting full clarity.7. Finger print sensor response is compartively very good.8. When I ordered phone I was thinking it is big size but it is very handy..!9. Storage expandable upto 512GB is really usefull.I feel phone is really worth for the price & you may like to use it. Without doubt you may order.

  A nice phone for Rs 16000. It also manages tonplay asphalt 9 on highest graphics settings. Yes i did face a bit of heating issue. To solve it, update the firmware to latest version, Reduce brightness to minimum , turn on battery saver and turn on dark mode. It wiil solve most of the heating problem. U would still get a little heat while steaming youtube video, whatsapp video call or playing games or doing a phone call for some time or simply charging the phone but that's quite normal for any android phone

  Bought this product when launched at its lowest price, had to wait quiet long for the product after intense surveying because I was avoiding high end phones because life of each phone is nearly same, and during the pandemic it was of utmost importance to save each penny instead of spending freely and also wanted to avoid phones manufactured by China.I had decided to buy a phone within 20K and this phone gave me all features which are in top end phones(30K-40K), off course there is difference in the quality.1.Camera picture quality- Though it has nice cameras(number wise e.g 64MP,32MP) clarity of picture is not so good,but worth it in this price range.2.Battery- 6000 mAh it says but it isn't actually its 5825 mAH and I use a third party battery application called accu battery which is especially for battery its charging speed,health,discharging,sleep time etc. and it shows around 5400 mAH, so can't be sure of battery, though they have got a certification regarding this but am not sure.3.RAM- I have 8GB ram version and its worth it in this price range. Sometimes it lags but that is acceptable.4.Internal memory- 128GB its satisfactory, what is even better that it has a dedicated slot for memory card and since  had onnem my previous device I was happy in it.Overall speaking it is a good range phone, especially it is MADE IN INDIA, of a South Korean company.

  I am writing this review after just 13 days of use and my screen has stopped responding to touch command. Never expected this from a high end Samsung Galaxy mobile and i have no option that i have lost my money. Now I have to run after Samsung service centre since i missed the return window by 3 days. Over and above this, amazon did not provide the tax invoice also so not sure how will i claim the warranty as well.

  The best thing about this phone is not its battery but the display. And the most acclaimed battery (and its charger) is a disappointment because it takes 3 hours to completely charge. Who has 3 hours to keep the phone for charging? Samsung should have provided a faster charger that could charge the phone in an hour and a half at the max, and a 15min dash to charge it 30 /35 percent. Apart from this the phone is great. Even now, Samsung can come up with a fast charger and people would buy it as per the recommendation instead of going for some other company charger which may damage the phone or its battery. Moreover the completely charged phone is good to go for one and half day for moderate use.A little more details after a couple of months usage. This phone needs to be little more rugged as it can crack at edges and screen very easily. An aluminum/any metal body would be much better. The battery after 2hrs 20 mins charge can easily take you through the day with above moderate usage. For heavy users, still a fast charging option may be required at the end of day. I mean who keeps phone to charge for 2+ hours? You cannot risk charge it whole night too. Samsung has produced a nice phone. It could be a game changer with some more changes.

  Hello everyoneI was looking for a Chinese  budget smartphone since last 2 months..but when this boycott Chinese thing started.. I changed my mind.. and started looking for a made in india device.. samsung m31 is the one you are looking for under 20000. I have the 128+6 gb version.. the battery is super cool.. camera is also decent even in the night time. The night mode captures decent photos at night. The processor is decent and handle the apps pretty good.. despite of having a huge battery the phone is comparatively lite.. and it feels comfortable because of the edge on the side.. it helps in the better grip. Super amoled display is just wow.. better colours..accurate sharpness. Overall the phone is very good.. go for it without any doubtI hope this review is helpful.

  White is not white. Screen is too warm in color. Video of human face has red tint. Selfie is totally horrible, it is beautifying fully and make clean face removing all the details. Signal quality is poor. Rs 8000/- phone redmi was connecting to internet without any issues and this phone was not. Also it was observed that voice will be heard after 5 seconds of call getting connected. This happens quite some times. Sound output is less both in speaker mode and in earpiece mode. I didn't expect so many issues with such reputed brand. Pl visit reviews with my above comments in google or GSM arena.com, many have brought out same points. But battery life is too good. Colors are punchy and vibrant but not natural  they are like over saturated.

  This is wrost phone of samsung brand. Because once a time samsung gives update a mobile. I am updating according to this after updating mobile screen looks blue and phone doesn't work. Any function of Mobile does not work it look like a dummy phone. I will call on customer service but he doesn't reply. So please customer don't buy this phone. If you're not believe please search on Google and YouTube also about this phone regarding update of this phone.

  Phone features are excellent, but customer service is worst..My phone fell down frm just 2ft and lcd disappeared, although screen guard or lcd haven't any scratch or broken. I've visited Samsung customer care, they stateted lcd will available after 15days n u you'll be charged 5500. I argued about the phone condition, display haven't broken.. He said, its company policy if you want to get it repaired, you've to pay, or else keep it with u.. They've kept phone for 15days and then informed Tht, lcd is not available, you can collect coupon worth 10000 n can purchase any Samsung product frm Samsung store..Maybe several customers had faced problem alike me.. Kindly, file a complaint against Samsung, result may be late but company have to compensate..

  We were cheated on this product. This mobile did not work properly even for a day. It lasted just three hours. After this there was a hang problem. It was restarting automatically. After this the speaker and microphone automatically stopped working in this mobile. I'm so sad to buy it. I bought something from Amazon for the first time. I did not know that I would regret buying from Amazon. Right now i'm so sad about it.

  Writing this review after two weeks of usage. The phone has some weight to it, which is something I was looking for and it really feels good to hold in hand just like the old rugged Motorola's.Display and the battery capacity are something which impressed me a alot and I can definitely vouch for it. Camera is also cool, but not that great, but it is good enough for the price you pay.The only thing I am little disappointed was it has some lag while browsing and if it is improved, the phone really rocks for the price.Overall when compared to chinese phones in the market, Samsung is really doing good in terms of service, trust and the value of the product.Also, would like to thank Amazon for fast delivery and awsome service.

  Bought this for my mum , who lives in a hill station , signal reception is very bad for this phone , Realme and Xiaomi phones have better signal than this one , also wife speeds are lower ,i dont know why samsung had to use inferior parts , spend 17k on a phone that doesnt give good call  experience , camera is decent , battery drains faster than expected , not satisfied .

  ProsAmazing display quality.Top notch clarity on Amazon Prime on par with OnePlus kind of phones.Camera quality is great in 64pixel mode back cam and 32 pixel mode front cam. Macro shot, food shot are good. Live bokeh on back cam is ok and front cam live bokeh will disappoint.Battery backup is definitely better than a 3000 to 4000 mAh with snapdragon SOC.General processing, speed and animations are seamless.if you are a fan of Samsung ui you would love it.Finger print sensor is good as the best ones , it's fast enough.ConsAudio quality with a Sony Bass headset is not so great, frequencies and noise cancellation is not soothing, cannot match a Nokia 6 Dolby, if you are music lover, this phone will disappoint you. Yet sound with a Bluetooth speaker was good. Surround effects on Dolby mode are good but audio quality needs some work.I am not a fan of custom ui and someone used to the stock android & miss it, still can manage with launchers like Nova to get the stock android feel.Has a lot of Samsung and third party apps which you have to disable. Some cannot be disabled as well. Of the 6GB, 1.5 GB is wasted on these apps. So you practically have only 3gb left after the OS and Samsung apps, which is not expected of 6gb ram device. A stock android phone will offer more RAM and processing power in reality, with the same hardware.Exynos is worthy for normal use and I am not sure about gaming as I have not tried.Extra memory and battery are in place because of the bloatware the phone ships in. These are not annoying like the ones on Micromax or cheaper phones. Most of these genuine ones, but one may not use them.Larger battery makes the phone heavier, plastic body gives a false feel like the phone is not sturdy, the phone actually is pretty solid, if you have a case and glass you don't find a difference.Over all a worthy smartphone and worth its money.

  Product is 100% genuine from the seller STPL exclusive. Phone is very good.Touch sensitivity, camera quality, phone looks everything is perfect. Phone is not heating while charging. Processor is very good.Dont go with the bad rating of the product here in reviews i think its fake and intended to defame M series and promote offline A series.Buy M series phone without doubt. Look for good offers as well. I got 1000 discount on icici card and bought this phone at 16499/- which is very good price for such a premium looking samsung phone.M31 doesn't have Samsung secure folder which is there in its rival A31 phone.

"
"

  People said to me in the past that Samsung phone hand but i didn't believe them till i bought M31 , last week my phone got stuck on Spotify app and then it didn't for move another 10 hours , and now again while i was getting a call from someone which i didn't answer , i went back to my device to see that the phone was switched off and  its been an hour that i am trying to switch it on . Now can i get a refund please

"
"

  From my experience of using M31 for the past one month-Pros:It is one of the best smartphones in this price range.Battery life is superb and also not heavy even if it's 6000 mah.As usual display is the best part of samsung phone.Cons:Design is not cool. Better use back cover.Don't expect much for camera, its just average only.Not at all a gaming phone, ita processor is not fast and the phone could not provide high frame rate.Can play pubg smoothly with medium frame rate and low graphics.

"
"

  Its been 10 days since i have started using the phone. There are certain things i'd like to mention.Pros: great camera, you get the best pictures even in dim light (YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED IF YOU COMPARE IT WITH REALME PICTURES BECAUSE IT DOES NOT USE FILTERS, IT GIVES HIGH QUALITY PICTURES, IF U NEED BEAUTIFICATION THEN THE FEATURES ARE AVAILABLE IN CAMERA SETTINGS), finger print reader is upto the mark, screen is very handy, it has got some great inbuilt features, speakers are good for one room echo,face detection is also one great feature in it. Battery  is one great perk. I charge it once in 1.5 days.Cons: hangs a lot while transferring file to another phone,occationally malfunctions and restarts without command, follows command with a little delay at some point, as compared to my MI A1 i find this phone a little not upto the mark in terms of performance. Super slow in charging. It looks like it takes for ever to charge.Apart from the camera i dont think it has anything super good to discuss. Its like a regular phone that one can buy. We as youngsters  are more obsessed with the camera thing and battery life, hence this phone is everything in terms of those. I haven't played games on it and hence i dont know how will that be.I am rating it 5 beacuse the cons i mentioned are temporary, it does not affect over all performance. I am satisfied i keep downloading files, use microsoft office on it, play youtube,click pictures and little stuffs so it works fine for me.

  Camera quality could have been upgraded. Evin though its 64MP, in low light  this is useless. Pic and video quality us bad in low light.Battery too doesn't last as for long. My Vivo U10 BATTERY performance is better compared to M 31 also the video and pic quality at night too is good if you compare it to M 31.The reason I purchased is because of the name Samsung. I somehow feel dissatisfied and disappointed.Price is ok and inbuilt memory is good.Have been using it from mid March 2020. Certain observations....a) twice the mobile restarted on it's own.b) heating issues when charging.c) on two occasions the mobile took around 6 hours to charge (100%).Now here is my review after the recent software update. I am giving it an additional star 🌟 from 3 to 4 .Major improvement are1. Cammera Single takes.2. Pic quality3. Video quality. Needs more improvement in stability and quality in night mode.4. No laging or hanging of phone. Automatic restart of the mobile has stopped.Overall the phone is great. I am now a satisfied owner of this mobile

  YOU SHOULD KNOW WHY THIS IS SUPER MONSTER. MUST-READ.Samsung has literally poured premium qualities in this phone.1)CAMERA - Quad Camera rich quality photos. Even after Zoom, details are very clear & No blurs at all. low light snaps are clear & stunning. Compared to under 20k Chini brands like (Viv/opp/Rme/Rmi) this is unmatchable.2)SENSORS - All sensors are quick, most importantly they're consistent & reliable (Which indicates its durability, Quality & long-lasting capacity).3)DISPLAY - Super AMOLED + Full HD = Baap of all displays. Glorifying video experience. Touch Response is quick & so far no single glitch.4)MUSIC QUALITY - Built-in DOLBY ATMOS technology. You'll experience the distinct Thump of bass. (also depends upon on the quality of your headphones like How much it supports to this technology)5)CALL QUALITY- Premium mic quality. Crisp & Clear voice calls. Supports almost all CODECS including Aptx6) RAM - Best RAM management, even after you play heavy graphics games along with complex tasks, you'll see approx 1.5gb still left. That means your phone is breathing easily even in heavy usage. NO HEATING.7) PROCESSOR - Many Reviewers are misleading on this by comparing snapdragon. but, few this months old Exynos 9611 chipset has mastered with 6GB ram to ensure thriving experience & to perform any task no matter what you doing on your phone. So far No complaint about the performance & during multitasking & Gameplay.8)GAMEPLAY - Heavy graphics GamePlay like Ark, pubg, Minecraft etc are fluent. So far No frame drop, even in high settings. Recommending to use Built-in Game Booster feature for Thriving Gaming experience along with AMOLED graphics. Just Imagine.9)BATTERY - 6000mAh juice will give you an output of approx 2 Days on avg use & 1 day(20hrs) on heavy usage.SUMMARY -  If you looking for a maintenance-free consistent device for 3-4 years then Go for It without hegitation.

  Moved from a Moto G5s Plus to Samsung .Pros :1. S-amoled display is just fluid , smooth and oh ghosh the deep blacks and the punchy colors . Undoubtedly the best display under 17K .2. 6000mah battery easily lasts for a day and half with heavy usage like 2hrs of Pubg , lots of social media stuff , photographs . The POWER MODE especially is phenomenal .3. 64Mp Camera is a beast when it comes to details but the 16MP ( pixel binning ) auto mode is the best where this device shines as the HDR and algorithms by samsung are just so perfect . No image over processing nothing . The Ultra Wide is the best as said by many top reviewers and it has distortion correction as well where as the Macro camera captures details and quality as it's a 5MP shooter .4. Exynos 9611 well its brilliant . Don't go for the benchmarks . Performance is superb bcz of the optimization . No lags and stutters . PUBG plays at HD and High frame rates by default and plays smoothly as well . That was a surprise to me also bcz I never thought of exynos handling games so good .5. The phone is not too heavy and looks pretty good overally and the Dolby atmos has its own magic when you're connected to bluetooth or wired headphones .6. The fingerprint scanner and the face unlock are supremely fast unlocks within a second and the Samsung UI over android 10 makes this phone the best midranger out there .Cons :1. The speakers of the phone naturally reduce while playing PUBG but it's not the case in playing other games .2. The back of the phone is plastic and thus it's a fingerprint magnet genuinely. Do buy a back cover for avoiding scratches.

  I received this pohne from Amazon yesterday. Let me start by saying that this phone is completely Made in India and the quality and finish is as good as any other imported phone that you will get.The specs of the phone are simply awesome and for the price it is an excellent buy. The Amoled screen is very good and has a Gorilla Glass hence there is no need for a screen protector, but no harm if you want to put one. It is advisable to have a back cover as the finish is shiny and could be a bit slippery.I have still not used the camera extensively but from the few pictures that I took during the daytime, they are very good.Took early for me to comment on the battery life but it comes with an awesome 6000 mAh which lasts for a very long time. Of course this will be dependent on what you use the phone for.It comes with a 15W fast charger. It charged the phone from 65% battery to full in little over one hour.Transferring all your stuff from your old phone to the Samsung M30 was a simple straight forward affair using the Samsung Smart Switch. You will need to download this on your old phone from Google Play Store. I did the transfer using the wireless mode.The specs of this phone are unbeatable for the price.

  Awesome Phone... No problem at all.... Simply mind blowing.... I would like to appreciate more that customer care executive to whom i talked the very first time. She was so polite and friendly and after understanding my problem she made this delivery on priority basis and it got delivered on time. The second representative was also good and i would like to appreciate him also. Please call me back tomorrow so that i can appreciate both of them on live call. It's a humble request from my end.

  I have been using M31 from last 3 months here are some pros and cons...Cons•Fingerprint sensor Dose not recognise sometimes, i tried to setup it again but had same issue. But since I updated my phone to latest firmware it seems to work fine.• The rare of this phone is made out of plastic which fells cheap and it scratches easily I recommend getting a Good case.•The font camera takes poor pictures indoors. Trust me it's nothing like 32mp it's just number.• Performance is not that good if compare it with Realme or Redmi devices. But here is the thing performance seems to be improved with last update. I’m noticing less lag. Just don’t get this phone for gaming the chipset isn’t good enough.Pros•Samsung is known for their Super AmoledScreen, this is one of the best display you can get under 20k. You will love watching HDR content on Netflix, YouTube etc.•On rear there are 4 cameras but i think you will only going to use ultra wide and wide. The depth camera is for portrait mode, And there is micro one for close up subject but quality isn’t good. The main 64mp camera is decent, quality is pretty great in day light but in low light it’s average. night mode dose it job in low light but use tripod if you can. Ultra wide sensor is great in bright day light.•LDAC support over Bluetooth is pretty sweet you will enjoy music on this phone if you have Hi-Res supported headphones.•This phone has 6000mah battery which is insane you can easily get throughout the day without charging your phone even if you’re heavy user you will be able to use this phone all day.So overall i think this phone best for media consumption. Watching Netflix, youtube, playing basic games, using  social media...If you’re heavy gamer who plays PUBG, COD like game this device isn’t for you. So if you don’t play graphics demanding games on your phone you will like this phone....

  Almost every call gets dropped after 20 to 30 seconds. On same SIM , other phones are working fine. So , its device problem.Expected more on other side but not up to expectations. Over all rating a B- if calls drop issue is resolved, else its worthless.

"
"

  This is a all rounder -1. Battery life is good, Though it would have made a little more sense if they had provided a better wattage charger then 15W. Plus side the battery life would last longer so.2. Camera quality is good. Though some reviews say not up to the mark - as the issue is there a separate option to use 4:3 64 MP which needs to be selected. Out of the box the default settings is 4:3 16 MP. This should help differentiate. This is in a way ok as 64 MP will use a lot of space for each picture as the size ratio is high.3. Display is the best as always.4. RAM any thing from 4 GB works well - Moderate use not talking about heavy gaming.5. Overall happy with the product and price is the best for such spec.

  Horrible camera. Kept fluctuating and shaking. Took it to Samsung service center. No one listened till I insisted and then they still said nothing wrong - that will happen. Finally, sold it in 12,000 as it was unusable and bought another company. Samsung should be ashamed making such bad cameras which have 0 stability and focus. Be warned before buying.

  I use my phone for almost around 18 hrs in 24hrs!! I don't know if the heating issue is due to that or not. But its getting heated up after using it for few mins. If you have your phone idle for sometime it cools down but then the instant you start to use it, it gets heated up. Can't have it over ear to speak on a call.PERFORMANCE : 4 starsCAMERA : 5 stars, too cool!!! Jus as promised!!BATTERY: 3 stars, cuz once its below 30, it starts to drain too quickly.SPEAKER: When playing COD/PUBG in landscape mode, the fingers goes over speaker and restricts the audio... Which is really annoying. If you switch to the other way, the notch takes up space and hides game controls like firing button.AUDIO JACK : Could've been on top. Being in bottom is so annoying that i couldn't place my phone over ground while on vid call.SCREEN CAST : Works perfectly. I tried with my Mi smart tv and its cool.Everything else is fine.Would be perfect if heating issue is fixed.

  The Box Contents :The Phone, Charger(15W), C-Type Charging-cum-usb Cable, Some Related PapersFirst Impressions :The Package was packed well and the Samsung  Box was compact.The phone has a impresive design and the weight was well distributed.After a week usuge:1. Display: As the Specification refers, it is sAMOLED. The brightness is well maintained  even in bright sunlight  you see the display  pretty  well. The viewing  angles  are also good. No color  changes  when views angles  gets changed. No queries  from my side.2. Body: The body is Plastic Back built with Gorilla  Glass 3 protection  at the front, the body felt a bit heavy as compared  to other phones  of this budget  section( of course thanks to massive battery).3. SIM Tray: The sim tray has the 2+1 Sim and MicroSD slot.4. Front Camera: Performed  well in Natural as well artificial lighting. Can see the detailed  texture  on the face(just turn off the Beauty  effect) and the one of the main function  is that during  calls, front camera  is used as ambient  light sensor  to turn off the screen. Some may find this not helpful it's  all about the habbit  that is to be developed with time.5. Speakers: Single speaker at the bottom right. I played  musics of high  frequency  and bass, at high sound it losses  it quality a bit but yes at 70-80% volume the sound was good and satisfying.The ear piece sound quality  is exceptionally  great.6. Rear Cameras:  The design  of Quad Cameras  impressed me, on the top left it got a 5MP sensor and below that we got a 64MP main camera module and below that we have a 8MP wide-camera and on top right corner we got a 8MP wide angle-lens and below it we got a single LED flash.The 64MP images are out the box. But you will notice  the overall  quality  of normal 16MP photos  are a bit rich as compared  to 64MP photos as capturing  image in 64MP and rendering  it to 16MP increases  it's  quality.The Live Focus  is impressive and the blurring  edge of the photos  is great in natural light but found a bit low in artificial  lighting.  I am satisfied very well.The wide camera Performed  pretty  well and got satisfactory  results.I am bit disappointed  with the Macro Lens that didn't  performed well, however  in multiple  shots I got a good quality  macro photo. But using main camera  for macro photos gives great results.The LED was pretty  good but it can be a bit more brighter but who cares, when it has a 64MP camera with night mode. Yes the night mode is exceptionally  well.7. Battery:  Yes the massive  6000mAH battery  is worth  called massive. I got the screen-on period  of 10hours in a single  charge.  On using it in a average way gave me around  30 hours of backup.8. Performance:  I experienced  buttery smooth  performance in using  it in above average usage.  But I will say that you can get  a bit lags in heavy task like playing heavy games. Yeah, you will not get that performance  as it doesn't  got a gaming  processor.But in daily routine jobs you can depend on it always you will never get a lag.The only visible  difference  between  M30s and M31 is that the Camera Module area is 2MM wider in M31 and the placement  of secondary  mic. is in top left in case of M31 and which  is on the right in M30sAs a average user 60Hz display  is okay for me, I didn't  experienced  any frame  drops.Overall the phone is pretty impressive and will never let you down in day to day task but for gaming you will face some issues like a bit heating, frame drops at high settings.I will reccomend  this product  for average  users. This phone performed well in medium setting in gaming and has a good AI in camera. It is good for photography and this 6GB/128GB black version is just out of the box.

  I mainly got samsung for its battery life.. usually I'm comfortable with Nokia for its battery life and rough handling..and previously I had Nokia sirocco..  this time I was considering poco and samsung m 31.. it's a good budget phone with very good battery life.. I use it for watching videos and it comes for 2 days.. camera quality is good for me, though not like nokia 8 ,but good enough for the price..I don't take selfies.. I've put the phone down from hip level 3 times accidentally and it has not broken so far.. better to have a flip cover for protection.. so my overall experience is very good as I got it after reading a lot of specifications.. I don't play games so I don't know about that.. why I didn't choose poco or redme was coz of the ads and battery life..hope it helps..

  After using the Samsung Galaxy M31 with 6 GB ram and 128 GB storage for more than 2 months, I list following pros and cons:A. Pros1. Very good display quality. Watching videos is a delightful experience2. Quad camera and selfie camera are very good. Low light photos in night mode are excellent with the 64MP main camera3. Fingerprint sensor is very accurate and fast4. Apps load quickly as expecteB. Cons1. Battery life is not as expected from 6000 mAH massive battery. Lasts about one and half days with normal use. Few phones with smaller batteries last for same time.2.charging the battery fully takes a very long time (about 2 hrs 15 mins from 15% to 100%) inspite of ""fast charging"", which is very disappointing.Overall the phone is very good and highly recommended.

"
"

  For camera:Change lens to 64 mp in camera setting. Change camera resolution to fhd or uhd.Using macro requires a little bit of understanding.Battery has 3 modes always keep on medium amd check the optimised button. While sleeping keep it on maximum.These are the issues people are facing because they have not fully set their phones.Now,The camera is genuinely amazing. Night shot are extremely well colored and aren't dull.Processor - the exynos 9611Simply put it resembles 675AIE in performance than the 722 AIE. So, that's one factor you need to consider.What does it mean?It means playing  PubG in ultra graphics will be a problem. Just that, at the extreme frame rate the phone will not be able to do it.Note:only at extreme frame rate dies the phone sort of fails.For everything else the maximum RAM usage is 4.2 and then under device care ckean your RAM. Also set the time to automatically clean your phone.Samsung UI is extremely good. It resembles stock android and the bloat ware is not annoying.Screen is next level. sAMOLED screen does its job.

"
"

  I am not sure what but I feel something is missing. The finger print sensor is not good. Sometimes it does not read finger print and we have to enter the pass code or pattern. Camera and battery is good. For medium usage it gives backup for almost two full days. With 2 hours of browsing Facebook and other websites, and about 2 hours of calls...using Bluetooth almost 7-8 hours a day. Battery still lasts for almost full 2 days.

"

  What can I say! When the phone arrived I really loved it, it looked a little heavier than my last phone, but otherwise it was good.But then why this one star review!Few days later, the phone was accidentally dropped from a height of around 1 foot and the display broke. The phone would not turn on no matter what I would do. I decided to take it to the service center thinking that this would be covered under warranty, but they clearly said this would not be covered. The display panel would cost more than 5k and I would need to wait at least 7 days. Fine, I thought. Then I received a call letting me know that the part is not available, so they will give me a refund coupon after deducting the cost of the part thats not in stock. Okay. I got the coupon. The coupon by the way can only be redeemed at designated samsung stores and not everywhere. It is also not redeemable online. So, I went ahead and got the lesser mortal M21 deciding not to invest much in any other Samsung mobile phone. But seriously I have used Lenovo and Honor and Vivo in the past. Why would a mobile handset be so fragile in 2020! It reminds me of the time when first these kinds of smartphones were introduced and one had to be really careful. Not only that, I saw many people with M31 queuing up outside the service center. I don't think the present mega review online justifies the experience of many users.Parting questions -1. Why create such a fragile phone?2. Why no spare parts available? Does it mean there are huge complaints already?Dear Samsung, honestly I expected better.

  Before zeroing in on the Samsung Galaxy M31, I researched the smartphone market in India and tabulated the data in terms of specs. For those looking to not give their money to the Chinese who are using the money to attack our country, among the Non-Chinese smartphones, the M31 presented the most bang-for-buck on paper.The M31 really good in every department, including in its massive 6k mAh battety, its AMOLED display, Android 10 OS, 6GB of RAM, 128GB ROM, Samsung's slick UI.At the sub 20K price range, the phone is an excellent buy.For photographers though not so much since it does not fully support CAM2API. Photographers can snag the Asus 6z, for its throw away price of 28k. The 6z supports shooting in RAW as well, unlike the Samsung M31.For the regular Joe though, the Samsung Galaxy M31 is a pocket friendly Non-Chinese phone option that is compelling.Amazon's delivered 1 day ahead of schedule.

  No Regret Mobile Phone. Samsung has improved a Lot. I have used till Note 10 & shifted to iPhone. I bought this M31 to gift to my wife. I am amazed to see the wow 😮 Performance of this M31. Stunning 64MP Quad camera to document your life, immersive viewing with 16.21cm (6.4"") Infinity-U Display, 6,000mAh battery and 15W Fast Charging. Superb Battery Life. Camera is little disappointing if you enlarge . But overall at this price range this is a wonderful phone you should buy. I will mark it 9/10. Go for it in this budget. Made in India 🇮🇳 Love it 😍

  It is the best phone for the budget from a brand lik samsung all though there is small flaws lik the main 64mp cam is a wide angle lens which looks a bit odd wit a slight fish eye effect and in low lighting it produces lot of noise but u get good detailing and the colour reproduction is amazing and lastly the processor could hv been even better i feel its not that its bad now but still could hv been better overall i rate an 8/10 for the mobile and s 1 more thing u should be aware of is that it doesn't support Samsung pay and Knox. Thank you for your time in taking time reading my comment hv fun peace ✌️ continuing my review after 3 days of usage i could find that charging time takes almost 2 and half hrs and sometimes 3 even though it supports fast charging upto 3hrs

  I have a good working phone -samsung A8 plus.. still purchased this phone as I  was excited with its features of 64 MP camera and 6000 mAmp battery-- both these features are a huge disappointment in this phoneno differnce from A8+ - or even worseno back cover/screen guard; purchased them online, before they come and start using this phone -return window expired..No fast charging as claimed, infact very very slow charging.......atleast no heating issues like other cheaper brandsscreen, touch sensitivity, fast processor -- are goodsound is again a disappointmentslow motion video and live focus on both cameras, both sim Volte enabling  - are the good features

  Excellent product..the specifications of this phone are truly amazing and not just on paper , the performance  of the phone doesn't let you down at any instant. The fingerprint reader is quick to respond and has no delay in unlocking the phone.  The camera is the highlight of this phone which allows users to capture splendid pictures (64MP) I myself have clicked numerous  pictures and haven't  faced any issues with the camera. The battery  life of this phone is more than adequate  for daily usage as well as gaming(performs well while running heavy games also). I'm extremely  pleased with the product and would recommend  this phone to anyone  looking for a smooth and hassle free experience.

  Phone speed - goodCamera - Very GoodBattery - Huge but device consumption is perhaps highTouch - Smooth (Better than Xiaomi and Realme)Cons - Person on other side while on call complains of a bit low voice. (Remember to turn off wifi calling for better voice. But even than voice on other side is not good)Back is plastic and not glass like other modern phone of this segment.Samsung launched it at cheaper price. Perhaps revised rates after some time.Overall - Good mobile. Will give you better feel than Xiaomi or Realme.

  Overall a good package at this price point. A brilliant phone what a below average software.Review update :My initial views were based on out of the box device. But I am happy to complete change my view to - a brilliant phir at this price point.Why this change of heart?The out of the box phone was a very powerful device only limited by its software. However in last few months Samsung has surpassed my expectations with its software release. Now this phone can stand head to head in functionality with ant high end phone.Kudos to Samsung.

  Okay so writing the review after using the product for 23 days..the product is good overall but there are many things i would like to mention here...first of all if u r a xiomi mobile user don't go for this one because it is not at all easy to use devices when it comes to its features compared to xiomi ..you have to install music player,app lock separately and in the applock of samsung u cannot hide notifications of particular apps...camera quality is really not satisfying as it says it is 64 mp camera...coming to battery life i would say it is good ..if phone is 100% charged then it survies for 8 to 9 hours of use...and if you use phone moderately it can survive for 12 hours max..i don't know phone has screen recording feature or not as i am unable to find it till now...it has a bit of heating issue i must say..my phone got hang for 5 to 7 minutes today itself and not even power button was working..setting is quite confusing or i may say not easy to use...i hope in next update they will make it better..Now coming to pros of the phone...even being 6000mah battery it gets charged comparitavely to other phones..speakers are awesome...fingerprint sensor works too quickly...camera captures good pictures in dim light also..processor is fantastic as it works without taking any time even if u are working on many apps at a time...

  I had ordered this phone for my mother's birthday to make her happy but guess what it ruined it rather  because the phone is defective, major issue with charging - 20% charging in one hour!! I have complained to seller on amazon, hopefully if they are genuine, responsible and honest seller, they should respond and exchange this defective product! And if they don't, i will post that too so that all amazon users can be careful and don't order from this seller and don't waste their hard earned money and spoil special days!!

  Samsung M31Reviewing this after one and half month of using this mobile.Pros1. Display is excellent2. Light weight ( though having 6000MAh battery)3. Battery life is good can use for 9 hours continuously with single charging4. No heating, No lagging overall performance is good5. Dual SIM slot ( both supporting LTE) and dedicated memory Card slot is given6. Camera performance is really good specially the Macro feature.Cons1. Charging takes lot of time about 3hrs to get fully charged.2. Mobile Speaker sound quality is not that goodFeedbackI think with this price range Samsung is providing decent features and this is the best mid range mobile phone available in the market. Samsung is actually improving it's performance.

  After around 50 days of using it, I will describe you my experience.Firstly, kudos to Amazon for such a quick delivery and excellent packaging.Coming to the mobile, the first impression is just amazing. Its smooth, fast and you can't come out of it.The display is stunning and camera is amazing. Battery backup is also too good. And it took me 40 min to charge from 2% to 100%.PROS:CAMERA - 4.8/5BATTERY- 5/5Display - 4.7/5Performance - 4.8/5Speed - 5/5Gaming experience- 4.8/5CONSNo screen guard or phone cover (As it is provided with Chinese phones)Camera design could have been made better (But I feel better compared to Apple 11 pro)Overall: 4.7/5 Samsung proves again why its the BEST MOBILE right now. Go for it.Made In India Made By Indians and Made For Indians.

  The phone is generally OK. Good Camera..Long battery Charge.Incoming SMS blocking is one of the important provisions in any smart  phone.But in M31, this is partially missing.SMS coming with a phone number only can be blocked. SMS coming without a phone number and coming with names of the business group can not be blocked. This is a great shortfall.Informed to the Help center through WhatsApp chat. They assured that this shortfall will be corrected in their next update. Till the next update we have to live with the disturbance of unwanted SMSs.

  Well 5 stars to Amazon delivery and service team.The phone I received had some issues with voice quality. It had a weird vibration and echo that use to come while talking. And calls did go blank in between. Not a network issue as I tried using multiple sim.They scheduled a replacement after a technician visit. Same issue persisted. So may be its defect in the make.Camera quality was pretty average. Pictures in day light were decent. Under low light the quality is horrible.Battery life of the 1st model I received was good. Charged pretty fast too. The second one had issues of heating up and battery hardly lasted for 12 hoursWell here it took longer for the refund but have to give starsto the support team at Amazon who kept up the follow up till we got a resolution. Really happy with both the customer service agents who helped in the process.

  Camera is good, call quality is good but the other person's voice can be heard outside even though the volume is low, when you are on call, which is a flaw in samsung phones.Speaker quality when you are speaking from a distance, in WhatsApp video calls is not good. I tried this with MI and they are much better.The major drawback is the claim made by Samsung about fast charging. Only 35-40% gets charged in one hour. So it takes almost 3 hours for full charge. I had Motorola G5 Plus which charged 60-65% in one hour, which means full charge in 1.5 hours.

  Update: 03Jun2020Visited Airtel store today and the customer care exec told me that all new phones autimatically switch to WiFi calling for better call quality.But I disagree.  Given the fact that WiFi calling is disabled in system settings, how can it be automatically switched to Wi-Fi calling?Still stuck. Samsung... Please help... Honour the phones system settings.-----First Review:The phone is very good in everyday usage.The only problem faced is that the phone automatically switches to WiFi calling while making or receiving a call despite turning off WiFi calling. The network is Airtel.This results in a situation where once the call starts, data gets switched off. No internet connectivity. So cannot talk and connect to internet simultaneously.Am writing this after a lot of googling to find a fix for this.The phone has April 1 2020 patch applied.Can Samsung or anyone out there help fix this problem?Also let me know if it is an Operator related issue (please mention what the operator needs to fix) so I can talk to the concerned.

  I will say excellent phone overall. Amazing camera quality and battery life. Phone speed is perfect and screen touch and navigation  is awesome. Over all for people who have issues with Samsung this phone, i do not agree as i am experiencing  best mobile phone. Camera quality is perfect and features  are so easily accessible. Under 20 k if someone is looking for  perfect and durable mo ile phone, then bilndedly go for this without hesitation. Amazon too delivered very fast and there was no issie in transferring  previous phone data to this one. Thank you Samsung  and thank you Amazon.

  Samsung galaxy m31 is excellant phone and reasonable price. Battery life is very good as if we charge for 2 hours it's more than enough for two days.Its had very pixel and great clarity images.videos are amazing.Fingerprint reader is working .

  Bought this phone instead of an iPhone SE 2020 as I was seriously looking to get rid of the crappy Chinese junk that I had been using do far. Done basic online research and I realised that both the M31 & A51 run the same processor. However M31 comes with a much bigger battery and a better camera both important features in my decision making. It's been a little over a month and I have no regrets. The phone is butter smooth in operation while I get a proper two day battery break up. The camera is sharp and produces amazing results. This is a phone for people who want a phone for basic day to day working. Emails calls browsing and reading selling with social media and watching videos all of it the phone does masterfully well. Gamers may not like this handset but they are a different segment altogether and this phone is not for that segment. I would recommend this to anyone with my eyes closed.

  Positives:Great battery lifeNice screen, thank you amoledConvenient features, fast connectivity (Bluetooth, wifi)Has not frozen once. No software issues yetNegatives:Face recognition and finger print recognition are iffy.Front facing camera is not sharp at all. Looks like my 2008 computer built in webcamSamsung apps that can't be removed. (Why add bloatware that no one uses anyways?)Plastic body while Redmi has metal bodies at the same price pointStill, a great phone at this price. I keep hearing rumors about how Samsung phones slow down after a few years, I'll see if that's the case and update this review accordingly. But right now, I do recommend buying it.

  Camera clarity is same as 48mp in Redmi note 8. There is no difference. 5MP macro is very waste comparing with 2MP macro in Redmi note 8 (better) and I am Very much upset that in this price range samsung is not providing the clarity  and IR blaster which is not included.  One more thing I don't know why Samsung is not providing headphones now, there is no back case or screen guard.  Please try to include.Not satisfied with CAMERA @ 64MP rear and 34MP Front..  these figures are just for mentioning only but not providing actual clarity.And one more thing..This product is not a scratch proof glass/ Corning gorilla glass. Scratches has happening continuous while putting in the pocket.

"
"

  Soo this phone is good to buy. It has a decent processor. It has great battery life. Its camera quality is a little bit low in low light or medium light but great in daylight. Selfie camera is great better than most of the phones in this budget range. I have seen some lags in this phones.....not much but still. Best thing is that i can move my apps from internal storage to sd card as most phones not allows this thing. It doesn't heat much even at games like Fortnite or pubg. Speakers are good but in headphone u got dolby atmos support which makes experience of listening music games in headphones great.

  This mobile is featured with 64MP rear camera and 32MP front..But after taking few snaps with both rear and front cameras ... The pictures of both are very poor and resolutions are not exact as given to this mobile....At present I am using Oppo F5 6GB mobile.. which has 16MP Rear and 20 Front.. after comparision with pictures taken with phone are far better than Samsung M31(64MP) (32MP).What to do today only i did received my wished Samsung M31 phone.. but bitter experience... Not satisfied... I hoped better resolution pictures but finally ended with disappointment.

  Booked on 9 th August and Got delivery on 10 th August.From very starting seen the battery charging issue. Even for charging for more than 6-7 hours never charged to full capacity. After 30 days situation worsened. So it landed to service centre. Another story can be written on  experience with Samsung service centre. ( to mention one thing --Not single employee wears mask at service centre .. seems all are superhuman) .So  after using hardly for 30 days  it's gone to service centre and found issue with charging port. Brand new equipment with charging port issue??? What's next awaiting God knows.Now can't return it, as return period is only 10 days after purchase. So stuck with this now.Think well before investing hard earned money in this.Dikhave pe mat jaao ....

   I have ordered 3 mobiles from this seller.1) Samsung Galaxy M312) Samsung Galaxy M21 (4GB 64gb)3) Samsung Galaxy M21 (6GB 128gb)In first order I received the mobile, which I feel was refurbished item. I placed replacement order and I got replacement.After receiving replacement, I ordered M21 (4GB 64gb) and accordingly I received the mobile. But now both the mobiles are showing one problem and i.e. apps are flickering (i mean apps mobile screen become black and while suddenly while running apps)This problem arose for M31 after replacement period ended. I had to place replacement order for M21. But it is on the way. Few days before I had ordered another mobile to gift someone. Order is delivered today but I am worried about.I this seller has problem. Because I have regular customer for samsung mobiles and first time I am facing so many problems with Samsung mobile.

  One serious issue i got after using it for a month, and i also read many similar comments in samsung community that is the restart issue. The phone sometimes restarts suddenly when we are still using it. And I really dont get any clue why this happens. No warnings, no reasons displayed. It just restarts suddenly..It has happens approx 6-7times during the last month.Overall it's good. But there features which are different from what I expected.The charger is not that slow. It's good enough.The battery doesn't last that long as I expected. Its above average.The position is of earphone jack is at the bottom, which is not convenient for me personally. Especially during video calls, it better to have at the top.The RAM is 6GB but 2-3gb is pre occupied. So I suggest only go for 6GB RAM.The loud speaker could be better in terms of quality as well as intensity of loudness.Overall it's a very good phone.

  Fingerprint reader : perfectly fast enough.Battery life: Awesome.Camera quality: Best in this price range.Ram: 6gb so will do the job perfectly.Gamers: Not the best but can play wellOverall rating in 9/10

  Its been over 3 months now with this phone. Some highlights :1. super amoled screen- probably the best display in the 11 to 20 k rupees segment, hands down. Much needed if are like me and you read alot on kindle etc. Having used an amoled once, won't go opt for other screens ever!2. Free VPN with Samsung max, so better privacy3. Its Made in India, and the ultimate profits go to South Korea, where samsung is headquartered (not China).4. A pretty low Sar value. So a much safer phone than its competitors, especially Chinese brands, in terms of the amount of radiation u are exposed to.5. Battery life is not that great as they proclaim to be, but it's still good.6. The camera is pretty good in this price range, and the front camera also does its job pretty well. (Tip- you need to change snge the default resolution of the camera to 64 mp to utilize the full power of the lens. Many people don't do this, and then they write bad about the camera)7. A fast charger- thought not as fast as other high end phones, the charger is a good improvement from standard chargers in this price range.8. Much more reliable than Chinese brands, and rest assured, they won't steal your data and won't snoop on you.What it doesn't have - an IR blaster, But that's not a big deal.

"

  You will get handset, charger , usb cable, and ejector pin in the pack.Fingerprinted reader fast.Battery life good.Screen color good.Camera good. You need to select 64mp to use camera in 64mp mode by default it set to lower resolution.Top side of Phone getting too much heated while in video call , or while using camera video recording.I called amazon support , they asked to do factory reset but no change.Playing YouTube video at 480p phone temp reaaches 42 degree.Wifi very weak, not receiving signal from my v380 CCTV.

  The first strong point of the Samsung Galaxy M31 is its design. The phone is quite comfortable to hold in your hand, though the one-handed operation is good. The battery 6,000mAh battery with 15W fast charging support, 64-megapixel main camera with f/1.8 aperture, 6.4-inch Full HD+ Infinity U display with an AMOLED screen resolution of 2400 x 1080 pixels and Samsung Exynos 9611 processor, are some excellent feature of the Samsung Galaxy M31 Smartphone, which no other competitor is offering right now at this price point.after 7 days of uses:Phone design & look - 5/5Camera  - 5/5Performances  -5/5Display  - 5/5Battery  -5/5User interface  -5/5Sound  -5/5awesome phone

  I got a 8Gb 128Gb variant. The phone is great value for money. I'm sure everyone's read the specs and are looking for more user experience insights, so here goes mine. I wanted to buy a phone which gets latest security patch updates at least for the next 2-3 years (else my office mail doesn't work). I also wanted one that was made in India and owned by an Indian entity. A phone meeting both requirements doesn't exist. So the next best option is a good phone (security  patch) made in India by an entity that does not have a Chinese owning entity. Options were Panasonic (Jap) and Samsung (Kor). I've used Samsung phones before so went for this which had the following pros:1. Made in India2. 6Gb/8GB RAM3. 64/128 Gb ROM4. Fast processor (handles heavy apps with ease)5. Smart finger print sensor with notification scroll feature6. Awesome battery backup7. Nice pics for this price8. Amazing display9. Great sound quality, enhances the music experience on external speakers too.10. Auto disable screen timeout when face detectedThere may be many more features I don't use.. but I'm a typical person mostly using for work and some web surfing. I don't play games so don't know.On cons (explaining why I gave 3 stars) is only one.. the first phone delivered started shutting down on its own after a day. I quickly raised a replacement request and I got a new one and that's working great but the hassle of having to do all that is not nice.  I also read that this issue is there a lot. So Samsung needs to take note and fix this.Otherwise awesome phone guys 15-20k range, this is by far the best phone. And it's made in India!! :) go for it guys!

  I had high expectations on Samsung M31, but after  using  for about  one Month, I found it not very impressive. I'm writing  this honest  review as per my observations.Pros -1. Display is very good.Cons -1. Charging takes too long, from 30% to 100% charging, it took more than 2 hours.2. In regard to battery lasting, I don't  find much differencebetween my old realme 3 pro which has 4045 mah and this phone which is claimed to have 6000 mah battery. I have to charge everyday.3. Most irritating is while attending calls in our ears it automatically goes to onhold mode and also call recording  starts automatically while placing the phone in our ear though automatic recording is off. Samsung should really work with these issues and correct the software options during calls.4. Finger and eyes sensor is also not so swift like my old realme 3 pro.5. Main Camera is also not very impressive upon comparing  my old phone but yes front camera  for Samsung M31 is better.I hope Samsung  will soon correct all these issues.

  The Galaxy M31 is comfortable to hold in the hand but is a little heavy at 191g. The weight of the smartphone is mainly because of the big 6,000mAh battery that it packs. Samsung has equipped the Galaxy M31 with an Exynos 9611 SoC and gets 6GB of RAM. It has two storage variants to choose from, 64GB and 128GB.64MP + 8MP + 5MP + 5MP rear camera | 32MP front facing camera 16.21 centimeters (6.4-inch) FHD+ capacitive touchscreen with 2340 x 1080 pixels resolution, 404 ppi pixel density and 16M color support Memory, Storage & SIM: 6GB RAM | 64GB storage expandable up to 512GB | Dual SIM with dual standby (4G+4G) Android v10.0 operating system with 2.3GHz + 1.7GHz Exynos 9611 Octa core processor 6000mAH lithium-ion battery 1 year manufacturer warranty for device and 6 months manufacturer warranty for in-box accessories including batteries from the date of purchase Box also includes: Travel Adapter, USB Cable, Ejection Pin, User Manual Fast face unlock and fingerprint sensor | Dual SIM (nano+nano) with dual standby and dual VoLTE , Dedicated Sim slot;Widevine L1 certification for HD streamingSamsung is my unprecedented favorite brand and I never used any other brand.

  Premium phone for a great price.The Samsung Galaxy M31 features a 6.4-inch full HD+ AMOLED display with 2340x1080 pixel resolution. The display is protected with a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass 3 on top.Samsung Galaxy M31 runs Android 10 operating system topped with the company’s own layer of One UI 2.0. The user interface is quite clean and the large app icons give a nice look to the device. There is also an app drawer where users can hide all the apps and can keep the home screen clutter-free. Like other Samsung smartphones, this one also comes preloaded with all the usual Samsung apps along with some third-party apps such as Facebook, Amazon, Snapchat, and others. Samsung has not included Bixby in the Galaxy M31 and along with this the Bixby Vision app is also missing from the device. The device also comes with Digital Wellbeing and Parental Control options which array of usual gestures. For instance, users can double-tap to wake the device and users also have an option to hide the three-button navigation layout and use full-screen gestures to control the smartphone.The camera is one of the major updates which comes with the Galaxy M31. The Galaxy M30s has a triple rear camera, while the Galaxy M31 sports a quad-camera setup. The rear camera of the device comprises 64MP main sensor, 5MP macro camera, 8MP ultra-wide lens, and a 5MP depth sensor. On the front, you will find a 32MP selfie camera. The company claims that both the cameras are capable of recording 4K video. Samsung has also added Night Mode in the camera for better photography experience. Like always the Samsung camera app is pretty clean and easy to use and users can find different modes to shoot within the app. Along with this, the app also offers a toggle that allows users to switch between the primary and wide-angle lens cameras. There is also a Scene Optimiser present in the app, which quickly detects the scene and set up the camera accordingly. We were quite satisfied with the camera results of Samsung Galaxy M31. The device was quick to focus and also offered an ample amount of detailing in the images captured. Swinging on the wide-angle lens camera offers a wider field of view along with some really good images. However, we personally loved the macro camera which offered really detailed images. The images captured in daylight were better as compared to the ones taken indoors. The Night Mode incorporated in the device also does a reasonably good job and it reduces noise from the images taken during the night. The 32MP selfie camera does a satisfactory job as both the selfies taken indoor and outdoor turned out to be good.6000 mAh battery with 15W fast charging support. Unlike other smartphone makers, Samsung has included a fast charger within the box. We were able to get through the day of mixed usage with a single charge, courtesy the powerful battery Samsung has packed in.The Samsung Galaxy M31 is a good option if you are looking for a device under Rs 20,000. It offers some really good specifications such as a quad-camera setup and a 6000mAh battery and that too with fast charging support. In terms of performance also the smartphone will not disappoint you. The smartphone comes under the budget segment but it doesn’t look like one.

  Overall  nice mobile! But charging speed is little bit slow minimum it requires 3 hrs for full charge from 0 to 100% . Except that I can't even find out any issues! No heating problems unlike other mobiles . mobile case is not provided  by Samsung . Camera quality is awesome. Fingerprint sensor speed and  recognition is fine. Minimum 1.5 day you can use this mobile with out any worries about charging even heavy usage. Overall One of the best mobile from Samsung in this price range. So surely I will  recommend this mobile to my friends.after five month of usage till now I won't change my opinion one of the best mobile in this segment. But now Samsung  m31 s is the best competition but SAR value is very low in this mobile. Samsung is best one.

  This was bought for my father. He was v skeptic buying this. We got this for 20,500 on emi. The phone reached in proper condition. The phone comes only with a charger & a pin to open the sim slot. What surprised me is that, no screenguard is already on it and we have to purchase one seperately. I already bought a flip cover for the phone which is doesn't actually do the guarding of screen for minor scratches. Samsung should pre apply a screenguard to smartphones, 20,500 phone and is not a small amount too. We checked the phone everything was good. The camera quality is sub-par. I am not impressed with the can quality. The music is playing well. All ok. Nothing wow about this phone.. just glad it will serve the purpose for my father. Will edit this review once I find out how is the phone working actually.

  Sometimes finger sensor doesn't work like A series.. means if ur finger r little wet it doesn't work properly . But I love this mobile , after many search I choose it and it is best as per my choice. Camera is good for orginal photography, samsung always captures the original picture not like realme or MI type extra brightness.

  Improved a lot...I bought Samsung M30 while an year ago and very disappointed with the product especially from mob gaint SAMSUNG. Now with M31 model Samsung improved a lot comparing to the M30  In terms of performance and design and External Speaker( Above Avg than Avg). Camera segment  as well.After usage of 1 month here are pros and cons.Pros -Display Quality 4.5 / 5Performance - 4 / 5Heating  - 4.5/ 5Battery - 4 / 5Weight 4.5 / 5Network Coverage - 4 / 5Cons -Majorly, External Speaker ( Above Avg) in short not bad or not good.. ( Samsung have to focus on speakersstill on these models) 3 / 5No Fast charging support ( it takes 2.5 - 3 hours for full charge) 3 / 5Design/Build - 3.5 / 5Overall, have to say tremendous improvement in their SAMSUNG products and giving very tough competition to other flagship models.Of course great thanks to Seller and amazon as usual for sending this..hassle free process.

  Disappointing. Can't get worst than this. Firstly received a faulty phone which never got switched on. I did not have option to return, only replacement was available. It took additional 9 days for the replacement to reach me that too after multiple conversations and ""so called"" inspection and all. After all this when I got the phone which was fortunately in working condition, I'm not at all happy with the output1- finger recognition is not very good, you have to tap hard.2- Face direction doesn't work on multiple accounts.3- phone takes forever for charging. How can they not provide fast charging in the phone of today's generation?4- phone is extremely slippery. Impossible to use without cover.5- speaker volume is pathetic.6- camera quality is okay okay.7- picture quality is pretty good.I will not at all recommend this phone. I'm sure samsung was able to sell huge number of handsets but they are only trying to ride on anti-china notion going on currently. Since there are very less option if you do not want to buy Chinese phone, many would buy m31. However, this phone more look like ""something built in hurry in an effort to deliver at comparatively lower price but without much R&D"". Dear Samsung, I was not expecting this from you. We deserve better, you owe us better.

  All are good but I don't think that 6000mah battery works like 6000mah ...battery life not up to the mark what I have desired ...samsung engineers must work on it .otherwise all things are perfect..compared to the price but those who say that 6000 mah battery goes for two days they are wrong  it works max 12 hrs on screen continuously but if u are not a hardcore user it works 1 day full. Those gyz who says in you tube that it works 1 and half day or two days ..that does not perfectly match with the reality.One more think charging time is very high u need 3 hrs to recharge it from zero to 100%. I don't have problem with the charging time but those who have problem with the charging time they may shift to a better option.

"
"

  The phone is amazing it supports all the games and handling is amazing.The battery life is toooo good after charging 100% which takes almost 2 hours the battery last for more than 36 hours even after using for long time.The camera quality is amazing the quality is pure gold .Super amoled display is very handy and smooth which allows very enjoyable gaming.The processor doesn't heat up even after long gaming hours. The game doesn't lacks at all it have a very smooth performance.I just have one complain regarding the fingerprint sensor which could be more sensitive as it doesn't accept the fingerprint in one go.

"
"

  Complete package at the price point.Amazing camera and great battery life. Plays games like PUBG without any issues at all, didn't feel excessive heat after half hour play either. 128 GB memory should last for everyone.Dolby is a great addition.

  This mobile have network connectivity problem at it's peak..i was using many other brand mobiles and i didn't face any network issue..this is my first samsung mobile, and for the first time i faced the network for both browsing and calling..even i have the fast network providing sim in my area.. i posted this issue on Samsung member community application.and i came to know thwt Many Samsung galaxy M31 phone users are facing this problem..still no update or reply for this..iam still frustrated about this issue

"
"

  To be frank!! I didn't find any usefull thing in M31 but we want to spend the money only for brand the only reason to buy this is for superamloed display finger print reader is slow when we are receiving calls it display after 10sec call reception is also slow samsung  must be concentrate on UI camera is good battery life is excellent but I didn't test how many minutes it will take to charge the full battery  The worst thing is charger other brands are providing best cable and adapter when we touch the other brand chargers we feel like premium but samsung chargers are worst like 100 rs road side chargers and also back panel attracts the fingers easily samsung should concentrate on lot of improvements in UI  Apart this the mobile is good one who are not students if you are a student to buy this you are must be a normal users not heavy users

"
"

  Hardwarw is good for normal use.Software is pathetic. Half the apps installed are bloatware and i am sure Samsung gets hefty profit.  Not only this, every update comes loaded with same bloatware. You have to uninstall the same useless apps again and again. Moreover, random advertisements creep up unexpectedly. This amount advertisement greed is unparalleled in the 6 Samsung phones i have bought over time including Note. Basically you end up paying for a higher end cpu to process meaningless advertisemnt information abd battery life suffers. All this is packaged under AI name.  I will not buy samsung anymore, however attractive their display. Choose ASUS or worst case iphone. Or google phone.

  I used moto g 5 plus for 3 years before this. After having extensively used Samsung m31 for two days I am in love with the software as well as its hardware. There's tonnes of features in this OS optimised by Samsung. There's redmi note 8 users in my house and I can tell you that those phones are absolute Sh!t in front of m31. This phone may not come with features like punch hole display, in screen fingerprint sensor but after having used this I don't miss those features. I hate notches on phones but the one on this is great and doesn't disturb the functionality of display. Great phone to buy overall. And bonus : this is not a Chinese spy phone.

  I was one of those guys who ordered this 6/128 gb phone on day one. One of the bad phones Samsung ever made. Even after few software updates, it still restarts on its own, mostly while into a browser and sometimes in other apps. Sometimes, instead of restarting, it turns into a SAMSUNG brick, ie phone will not boot and only Samsung logo keeps on displaying for long. In this condition, you can not restart the phone with power button, you have to use RESET method.  Fortunately, in this case, it only restarts and doesn't get hard reset. Battery lasts for only 4 hours of video, otherwise it's pretty good and lasts for 14-16 hours easily with normal use. Voice from earpiece had started getting deteriorate and I found that the earpiece mesh collects lot of dirt because it sits in a groove, thus vitiating voice quality. It's not waterproof (not claimed too) so if you splash water onto it expect touch to not respond and speaker volume to be extremely low for an hour or two. Though it worked perfectly after three hours of drying after I dropped it once in the water and it got submerged fully for a second or two. Samsung Swipe keyboard is little weird, many times typing wrong words. I can't say more about camera as I don't use it much. Single speaker is not bad for listening music. Fingerprint scanner is not so good, most of the time doesn't recognize. Face recognition is better than that. Still, except for the bricking part, it's a good phone for its look, screen/ resolution and hardware for this price.

  After using 1 month, 6GB-64GB varient, Black colourPros:●Good Battery. I am a bit heavy user, still end of the day (6am to11am)40% Remains. I chatted for 3 hours and it sucks 5%battery only. Thats damm cool.●UI is very smooth and handy.●Screen quality is just awsome.●No heating issue in normal Usage. I have tried 13 apps running in background.(no gaming apps)●Fingerprint reader is fast but face detection is not so fast though its good.Cons:●Cam quality is not up to the mark. It has 64MP, still edge detection is not that perfect. My earlier mobile was Nokia 6.1Plus which has 16MP cam, still I find that better. Hope a soft update can fix this.●I prefer stock android, ANDROID ONE...anyway This UI is also good.● Mobile heats while gamming. This is not a gamming phone. Though I didn't play PUBG or Freefire or CALLofDUTY. Still it heats.. so no question of playing those games.●Charging time is too long and it don't support fast charging. 15w charger in the box and it takes nearly 2 to 3 hrs to charge this phone 0 to 100... I even tried it with Dash Charger(1plus).. still the result is same.. it has long battery so I will not complain about this as I charge it at night.

  Samsung M31 is wow for its battery. Fingureprint reader is very nice it recognized very quickly, someime I found it's  unresponsive (3times in a 2 month) so used face recognition  or have to use PIN. Camera I like to use 64mp main camera at 3:4. It is amazing in revealing details of close up picture (you can see clearly and  detail of these tiny roof moss/algae, 3.5mm headphone jack was used for size comparison. When I use for scenery photos are good too. Only problem I found is sharpness of photo at highest zoom ( zooming photo to its highest) I think sharpness is good but not best. Samsung should improve processing of photo for excellent shrpness otherwise what  is benefit of giving better lens. I usually use  Adobe lightroom. Last 2 pics were processed in lightroom.  All other camera are  good too. Video quality is very good. All I'm very satisfied for having Samsung M31 phone.

  This is the first time i owned a samsung product....and to be honest it is one of the best phones i have owned till date....the screen quality is top notch and battery is just insane...and as i am not a gamer i have not faced any issues with the performance..but i can assure you that if you are a casual gamer than this phone can handle everything thrown to it...it is quite a capable processor, but i have seen so many negative reviews about the processor on youtube...i don't know why??? It is a processor more capable than sd 665 and equivalent to sd 710....but still people are complaining on youtube and reviews.....

"
"

  Not the best phone on the market. can never come close to their flagship phones. So many features are not there. Its like it's made to feel midrange. The camera is horrible. Just take my word for it. When I bought this phone, I read these reviews, and I was like wow these people probably don't know what they're talking about, but yeah it was a late realisation. And of you're a serious photographer, then forgot about this phone. The camera has no pro mode features. It doesn't have manual focus, or shutter speed . Night mode is so gross you're never going to want to use it. The battery was supposed to be amazing, its not. Its just good. Like a 4500 mah battery. If you're looking for a great UI, then I'll have to get your hopes down again. This is not one UI, it on UI core. Which is basically one UI stripped of all it's cool features. Some great alternatives are : Samsung m31s (if you really want Samsung) realme 6, redmi not 9, Poco x2, and Motorola one fusion. You can trust me here I have a lot of smartphone experience...

  I'm reviewing this phone after using it for nearly two months. I bought this phone as a temporary replacement to my flagship. I'm actually very impressed by the price to perfomance ratio of this device. The biggest USP of this phone is its OS. Samsung's OneUI 2.0 has improved tremendously in reducing bloatware and managing RAM efficiently.  It multitasks with ease. The battery life is fantastic. I'm putting my device to charge every alternate day, the screen on time is at least 9-11 hours depending on the intensity of the usage. The Camera quality is great, not outstanding. The speaker is loud and clear. It has Dolby Atmos audio drivers for external audio devices. The call clarity is excellent from both ends. The rear camera does a great job but the front camera doesn't live up to the expectations. It smoothens the images taken from the front cam, not sure if it's because of the sensor or if its in the software. Since it's a budget phone I don't think it would be fair to expect a lot.  I'm not much of a mobile gamer so I never actually tested it in that aspect. The overall build quality is good, looks premium but the entire body is made of plastic. It nearly takes 150 mins to charge to a 100% with the 15W factory charger. The speed doesn't change even if you use a charger of higher capacity. Coming to the conclusion,  I feel this is the best budget phone considering the price and brand value of Samsung. It does its job perfectly and I'll definitely recommend this phone.

  For the price this phone has really surprised me in the camera department! The shots come out really good n detailed..the only big disappointment is the processor..even with 6gb ram the phone still feels sluggish like a 3gb ram phone...lags time to time..typing slows down..if you are a really fast typer you might notice it..battery charging speed is decent it fits the price range..display is beautiful..another big plus point..vivid mode on the warmer side gives out nice vibrant colours..speaker is average..I'd suggest you put in a few extra bucks n go for the 8gb variant as more ram will help run the apps smoother and may cause less lag.4/5* for this!

"
"

  Simple and straight:Pros:- Battery- Display clarity, bcz it's Amoled and also the size- Enough speed according to it's configuration. Mine is of 6gb RAM- UI, i used Mi before and thought it was the best UI till i started using this. This ONE UI is too good but will let you know about Flaws in ""Cons""- This one for Amazon, i purchased it with exchange of my MI mobile bcz of the recent revolution, u know. The exchange value was very good, thanks to Amazon.Cons:- Fingerprint scanner sometimes is non-responsive, have to use power button to awake screen- There is no multi tasking windows available in this UI- Media volume is not loud enough, Bass lovers can't have enough loudness when playing music- No IR blaster, which is very useful, Samsung should provide atleast in future- No LED indicator for notificationThese are what i observed and mentioned as per my experience, may be useful especially for anyone going purchase or Samsung and for Amazon. Basing on these, you can consider your priority. Cons aren't that big and few can be changed or updated. Finally I recommend for buy. It is a Good Mobile.

  Good phone but BEWARE....(1) The front facing does not look like it's 32 MP.(2)The BATTERY is NOT NOT NOT good. It drains off in 12 hrs flat heavy use. But even if you use it with ease it doesnt seem to stretch to 24 hrs.SAMSUNG's claims seem to be not correct about battery.

"
"

  Wonderful product!!Glad I bought this.It is more than 3 months now since I bought this phone!Battery life is excellent! I use my phone with wifi and data on with multiple apps running together. Even after 8hrs of use it consumes only  50 to 60 percent of the charge.Camera quality is also good.captures fine details well. The live focus is also quite good. For regular use and daily photography it is beyond sufficient.  I had seen few poor reviews about the camera, but it turned out good.The finger print reader is quick and responsive.Overall good value for money! With a sturdy back cover and a tempered glass it Is good to go.

  This is my 4th Samsung mobile device having used different models over the years starting from Wave series.M31 is a definite buy if you are a heavy mobile user where battery, call quality and connectivity is priority.+ Battery has lasted me for more than a complete work day with approx 4hrs of talktime over 50 audio calls over mobile network, 5hrs mix of Microsoft audio call, Google meet audio call, atleast 30-40mins of what's app chatting throughout the day and almost an hr of social media including audio & videos with GPS always ON.Charging is pretty fast.Battery: 10/10+ speed of device which has been brilliant in multi tasking and switching between appsPerformance: 8/10+ support for airtel wifi callingConnectivity: 9/10Camera was never a priority for me however is pretty decent.Camera: 8/10What I didn't like is the bloatware that gets installed from Samsung Galaxy store. That's bit of a pain.OS Software: 5/10

  To all the user who are seeking a mid range phone do not absolutely not buy any Samsung phone. For the first time I bought this M31 Samsung product. And within a month the phone stopped working and I had to visit service centre which took 1 and a half month to rectify my issue that too when I lost my patient and decided to move to Consumer Forum. The most drastic experience I ever had.Now talking about the phone it is simply not worth the dont be fascinated by the add it is not anything like the advertisement.Battery is not fast charging.You take 6 GB or 8 GB after a while you will experience slang and hang up.Camera for name 64 but more equivalent to 12 or 16.Support worst nor the service centre or customer care will do it in time. All you will be getting is harassment . This is my experiences and I will urge and advice all my friends and family do not buy not only this but any Samsung product .

"
"

  After 29 days phone stopped working. Phone is not getting switched on, tried every possible way. Amazon is refusing to replace as the 7 days replacement period is over.I took it to a service center and after few days I received a call from service center that please come and collect your coupon and return all the original box contents to us. I thought they will replace my phone but I was given a SERVICE REFUND COUPON of ₹17499 which can be redeemed only at a Samsung Store (Not Online). But they catch is no samsung store has samsung m31 or m31s. I don't like the A series phones. Don't know what will I do with this useless coupon. I have no other choice other than buying overpriced A series phones and S series phones

"

  Camera is something personally wanted to be better. Otherwise it's a complete package for an indian user. Rough usage and regular users will love this phone.. under this budget u may get many options but not the stunning display quality like samsung. If u are looking something that feels best for videos and pocket too..  Here it is. Go for it. Samsung delivers the best in class display quality. I have 4 samsung smart phones. And its a trust worthy review. Might not be a gaming phone but a perfect regular user's companion.

  Good thing is that I got the phone delivered withing just 4 hours on the launch date in March 2020.As per suggestion I updated phone immediatelyThe look and feel is nice. Phone quality is good. Also it has AI features in the camera. E.g I can point the phone camera to Text and it can translate, I can point phone to pics, cars etc, and I can information about it.Phone charging is good. It has fast charging, but since battery is 6000 mAH, it takes long time to charge, no complaint about it.However I have experience the phone hanging on the usual applications such as Google Chrome, Internet explorer. The Text box does not open up. I need to close the application and reopen it so that I can type the URL, search criteria of my choice.Once this phone restarted on its own.Also I have experienced that the Mobile data turns off automatically and it does not get on even though in the settings the Mobile data is turned on.Like most of the people I am using Data from JIO which is inserted in SIM1. Today I set the data for SIM 1, no idea how it got selected for SIM2. Please note that I have not opted for Data in the SIM 2 and hence whenever the data from SIM2 is used then heavy charges are applied.Because of these issues I faced giving 3 stars.After 3 months, I experience the hanging once every week.Gets heat up a lot on video calls of WhatsApp, Zoom and Duo calls and restarts automatically.So overall, not recommended.

  Firstly I want to describe the phone's external structure :->the phone is very slim .>Holding the 6000mah battery still it is very light.>but for the people with the short fingers it is hard to access the finger print scanner.The security of the phone:->It gives you the access of finger print scanner. It recognizes and the finger opens the lock very fast.>there is also face scaneer which opens the phone preety fast.>no one can access the phone with out the access of phone passwords.Specs of the camera are the following👇>64 mp rear cam is very good compared relatively to the phones at this price.the pics just awesome you can enjoy them.>the 8 mp ultra wide camera is very good.>the clarity of 5 mp macro camera is very good compared to top end phones.>32 mp front face is so clear that your friends would be jealous of you during the video calls.talking about the display:->the screen is 6.4-inch(16.21 centimeters) Super Amoled - Infinity U Cut Display.>it supports colours over 16 millon.Gaming specs:->while playing the games like pubg ,COD and fortnite it is not the best .>The battery is so good that u could play upto 20 long pubg games in the phone.>You can download fortnite in this this by the help of samsung galaxy store.so it stil good for fortnite users.In this budget this is the best phone over all the phones.

  Hello everyone,I am sharing my personal  feedback on m31 after using more then 15 days.1. Battery backup is very bad.  Not. working for full day. Its take 3-4 hours for full charge. No fast charging  available  with this phone.2. Camera quality is not up to mark  as per 64 mp . Selfie  camera is good. File size for single file is showing 25 mb but quality  of picture is not good.3. Face lock sensor  is also  not working  properly.  Some time it works or some time you have to use finger lock.4. Phone processor  is slow as compared to SD series.Total  waste  of money. Please consider  other phone in this price range.Regards,BSB

  Yeah after 15 days of usage..heres my review about samsung galaxy m31PROS1.Amoled display of course the (best in midrange smartphones.)2.camera quality is awesome u must know fully about it and use.(I have attached a couple of shots.)3.Mega battery (lasts one day even if u do 5 hrs of gaming and 2 hrs of watching videos).4.Brand resale value of Samsung.5.Processor is fantastic for everyday usage and good for gaming.6.unexpectedly fingerprint  sensor works so good.CONS1.Stereo speakers are not so loud..they are just aaudible.2.Not a glass back just a polycarbonate body.3.Its an internet model and back covers are not available though im nt a backcover user but i tried finding some in the local market.4.Only two colour options.5.charging takes 2 and half hours to completely charge the device.6.some heating issue when using wifi.FINAL VERDICTThis is an awesome mobile from samsung that competetes with the likes of poco x2 and newly launched moto fusion plus.If u love an perfect brand to buy which gives  regular updates to keep the phone upto date then defintely go for it.😁

  I am using this phone from 7 days and in the seven days I have reviewed it and below are my observations:Unlock speed-Unlock speed using face recognition and fingerprint sensor is really super fast. you will not feel any lag while unlocking the phone it will open it up with just in fraction of a secondCamera -Having 64 MP camera in a budget of this phone is really unexpected you can click eye catching pictures using front and back camera the back camera has 4 sensors which allows you to click macros, depth , Wide Angle and normal pictures in high definition quality.the front camera which is 32 MP allows you to click steady pictures with wide angle for group selfies as wellBattery life and charging -Well, with the battery life I am not that much satisfied as I expected it to be. Having 6000mAh, it lasts for 1 complete day which is good, I liked it. But I thought it will last more longer, but since it has sampled display and 6GB Ram and super fast processor, it takes probably more power. But battery performance will not disappoint you, I used this mobile for Internet surfing, video calls, Netflix and YouTube and it was pretty good. Charging takes time because it has a huge battery in it, so it will take around 3 hours to fully charge it.Performance -Over all, the mobile's performance is really fast with Samsung's own processor and 6gb Ram you will not feel any lag while using this phone and it has latest Android and security patch level so you will always enjoy while using so many apps in the background.Overall summary -In this budget you are getting the features of a 20 to 25 k mobile and Samsung is a reliable brand you can trust on. It's made in India mobile so you can definitely use this mobile without any hassle so go to amazon Amazon Samsung website, buy your mobile, start using it and enjoy!

  Initially, when I got the phone, I encountered the problem during startup, refer to the attached picture but after getting the technical assistance from the Amazon team, I was able to successfully launch my phone and i am not facing any problem after that.Pros:1. The processor is really awesome. I did not see any lag and games like asphalt9, catapult, mortal Kombat, shadow fights are running perfectly fine without any heating issue.2. Battery life is super and working two days in a single charge with heavy usage.3. Camera quality as compared to OnePlus 7 is comparable but OnePlus7 is the winner but considers the cost of OnePlus 7. Overall pictures quality is good.4. Call quality is also good but the speakers are at the bottom so if you're watching videos without headphones, you will struggle with sound as you're fingers might cover the speakers.Cons:1. Battery charging is slow and i think this is due to the fact that battery is 6000 MAH. It takes 4 hours to charge fully.2. It's not coming with a default screen protector so you need to buy it separately and i did not find the good screen protector so far for this phone.Overall this is a fantastic phone with all the good things about it so go for it. I am using 6GB RAM and 128 Gb storage phone.

"
"

  I'm satisfied with the overall performance of the mobile. Battery life is excellent. Camera is fine enough and keeps good and clear pictures, provided you hold the phone for a while. Though it is not up to the mark of 64MP. At highest resolution you cannot use the zoom to take the pictures. Sound quality is clear but could be louder. Not a heavy device. Wifi connectivity is fine. Display is superb. Speed is fine but sometimes lagging make you feel that for 8GB RAM it could be better. I connected my 1TB hard drive to it and it had no problems to read it. Transfer of files can be done with OTG pendrive or external Hard drive. Fingerprint reader works fine but face reader is not that sensitive.At the end I would say that with its pros and cons, you may go for it.

"
"

  Update from my end after 2+ months of use: heat issues has been sorted out after few updates. You can confidently buy this phone at this price range (15-18K).Call Quality - 10/10, crystal clear voiceNetwork quality - 10/10Camera - 6/10 (64mp or 48mp is just numbers now a days, doesn't work like expected). But one thing, Photos in night is really awesome, better than even high end phones I can confidently say.Previous feedback was:______________Heating issue. I have requested return. Heating very much near ear speaker/camera area/top area of mobile (even without charge or apps open). I'll  keep you posted regarding status after 10 days too.

"
"

  Obverall performance is best. Samsung is Samsung.  Even better than socalled redmi series. Its display and dolby atmos sound is awesome. Main is speaking clarity over call which is supab. Battery life goes upto 2 days even after using it as hotspot device for my smart TV for more than 6 hrs. primary 32 mp camera takes gr8 pics. I won't say rear camera is not good. It is also gr8. But u can't use flash in 64 mp setting.  Fingerprint sensor and face unlock do its job well. Fast charge takes 2 and half hr to full charge from 10%. But I prefer more slow charger as that will increase battery life. And remember it has non removable battery. So why to worry if it takes 4 hrs to full charge. Overall go for it without thinking for alternate.But one problem, seller didn't supply ejection pin with the mobile. I don't want to return as mobile is superb. But seller must check such mistakes before delivery. For someone he may forget to send charger or even mobile. I would expect that delar to send the ejection pin seperately as I won't get it from market.

"
"

  I will divide the review between pros and cons so as one can make informed choicePros:1. Camera creates stunning images.2. performance is good, though not checked any games.3. UI is really well designed, lot of customization available, need to skim through the settings.Cons:1. The battery lasts 1o hours with continuous hotspot ussage OR One and half day with normal internet and mobile usage.2.  Supplied 15W charger takes approx 2.30 to 3 hour to fully charge the phone.3. Camera Video artificial light performance is not good and get worse if slow motion mode is used.

   I have been using galaxy M31 for about 2 months now.Pros:Battery life is really good.Display quality is excellent.Noise cancellation effect is good.Camera quality is suprb in daylight.Fingerprint reader is moderate.Face detection is good.Build quality is good. Once i dropped the phone and thought it would have damaged the screen, but nothing happened. Had it been my previous so claimed metallic Chinese phones it would have definitely caused a body dent and screen crack.Cons:Charging time is high.Night light pictures are not good.For ergonomic use phone would have been a little wider and shorter. This is my personal preference.Overall a gòod quality product from Samsung.

  Fingerprint reader is good unless you have sweat on your fingers..... face lock is very accurate.The battery life is awesome and long lasting. It comes with McAfee antivirus preinstalled as inbuilt part of phone settings. The camera quality is somewhat controversial....... the quality of pictures clicked is very good.... the AI of camera is also nice ... only problem faced by me is it doesn't look like its 64 MP..... my mother has one plus 6 and it has 20 MP which I compared and found has equal zoom..... otherwise the quality of capture is far greater than even my sisters one plus 7. I recommend this phone and in this segment ..... samsung has just got everything boosted. The ram us also good..... I have not played very heavy games on it except once I played a 3.5gb role playing game and it was still working fluid. Front camera is also very good and captures really clear pics. Macro camera is also nice. I charge this phone once and use for almost one and a half day without trouble. It's a bit heavy than recent smartphone but it's because its battery is jumbo but the weight is evenly distributed and once in use..... you will never find it a problem. The Dolby sound AI works really great and is only applicable when using earphones or headset. The inbuilt speaker is also loud and clear. The screen has very diverse, bright and clear display.Totally recommend it ...... I purchased is within a month of its arrival on Amazon

  Among the range of below 20K, this is the Smartphone, everyone should blindly go with buying without any second thought.It has the needed Elegant look, amazing screen display, camera, battery, Classy feel, etc. JUST GO FOR IT!! This phone has everything that I expected. Battery lasts for 2 days with normal use, listening to music for couple of hours a day including watching a whole movie on prime.Check the detailing of the camera took in the dark in the pic uploadedI have also recommended to my friends and families, and post me I have made them buy too :)

  Battery takes nearly 5 hours to charge completly.... Wen compared to other phones with fast chargers which can complete 100% in 1 hour ...so in 5 hours we can chargr 5 times  completly other phonez....in this genration waiting for 5 hours to complete for battery to charge is really big mistake by samsung..... Touch sensitivity  is Also poor and performanece is also not good

  It is about 3 months since I got samsung M31 and must say this is best phone in this price range..Good 64mp camera, and good selfie 32Mp camera..Best Amoled display in class,6000MAh battery will last long about to 1-2 days with normal usage,Impressive samsung UI 2.0,The phone is really worthy

  Really great phone at a great price. I have been using since two months..runs smoothly without any lag. The best thing is the display. Amazing amoled display with true black which dramatically enhances the user experience and the infinite display is a plus.The camera is quite good. amazing picture quality with a good resolution. Front camera is quite good and convenient for video calls. 64 mp camera, along with wide angled camera are some cool featuresBut it becomes little bad when you zoom.. like water coloring... image processing can be improved. But is acceptable at this price. Dont expect picture quality like that of an iphone or a 30000 plus phone.Battery is good enough for me. As i use it only for calls and browsing and normal regular use like watching movies, YouTube...it gives a decent battery support and lasts upto 1 and  a half day. Not suitable for gaming purpose. Doesn't feel like 6000 mAh. Might be because of the Amoled display as each pixel actively consumes power. Although, black screen uses no power as compared to LCD, still Amoled consumes more power than an average LCD or LED display. Again, battery performance acceptable at this price when compared to the other cool features at this price.Fingerprint sensor works smoothly.And at last, amazing looks and i really like the ocean blue color and the sides are gradually blackened! Stunning looks.

  I really disappointed with this choice I made,I am writing this feedback after using 21 days ,Pros:1)Light weight2) Android 10.03)User interface is good4)Asthetic5) quick finger print readerCons:1) build quality is not good2) camera really sucks3)I don't know when samuang will stop using Exynos processor n start using Snapdragon,4) Ram manangament is not that good comapre to other mid range phones5) 15W is not enough6) Simple, just Auto Rotate option has not givenWhen you drop down the menu7) though it is 6000mAh, batery life comes  just 1 day though not heavy user

"
"

  I purchased a Black 6/64 varient on 4th May and in 3 weeks I can confirm that I regret purchasing an iphone 7plus worth 62 thousand that too 3 years ago.I am not a user who will zoom a picture and compare the pixals, honestly, is that needed? You dont really zoom pictures more than your phone's size so why make the hype.About the security, I was concerned previously but as I was already using Google apps so I dont really think this scares me at all.The performance of the phone is really amazing and the reason why is got this phone out of a number of product makes me happy everyday: 2 days battery life on good use.Somewhere I also feel that this phone provides me more features than ios 13. I don't really miss charging my iphone twice a day lol

  I received this on 20 March 2020.I have used Redmi note3 , Redmi note4 and micromax yurekha before coming to One Plus 7T. My experience so far with this:1. Display: It's amazing. Sharpness, brightness and 90Hz displays makes it one of the most beautiful displays.2. Camera: All of my previous mobiles had great cameras. But this one is Mind blowing and amazing. If you are a professional photographer, you might find differences. Amazing Camera3. Battery: One of the best from Samsung mobiles. I am getting a very good battery backup. When I go to bed, it's 30%. 30T Warp charger is a booom.4. Performance: Blazing and Lightning fast.5. After using my previous mobiles, I can tell you that it's the best. Lots of gestures, shortcuts and very lightweight.6. i don't have any Complaints on this phone. Finally I love Samsung Galaxy M31.Go for it guys !! You won't regret. My rating 4.5/5.. :)

  Best alternative for chinese phones by samsung . Not some major flaws but it would have been more great if there was a glass back than a plastic one but it's not that major flaw just put a good cover and  you are good to go. It has an good battery of 6000 mah and goes for 2 days straight . Camera is excellent . The combination of four cameras make the photo look awesome . The fingerprint reader is also good and fast . Samsung has given a seamless experience with stock android and no pre installed apps . I will recommend this phone to buy with closed eyes . Best phone under 20000 rs just go for it without further thoughts .

  Gifted this to my Bhabhi and she finds it really nice. Been a month and she is happy with the performance.I personally want that camera in any phone has to be nice. I really love the camera and inbuilt filters as well.Very easy to operate. No rocket science. Anyone can easily access. Even my 2 years old niece also opens YouTube and photos easily. 🤣😜Very good buy for the price you gave. Prefer it over other brands because of its features and reviews I read before buying.

  I am writing this with my experience of 10 days usage.Battery::I have used many models. Battery wise this is the best mobile I ever used. I use my mobile heavily (personal use, office use, video streaming, net browsing, gaming). For me it is giving 1 full day.Finger Print Scanner::Working accurately but little slow compare to Lenovo and honor mobiles.Camera::Camera is good but not up to the mark. Infact I have a disappointment on this section. Taking too much time to sharpen the picture. Difficult to take children photos. But overall is OKAY... It's camera is good in daylight but in low light conditions picture quality not good.Performance::I give you 5/5 in this section. All previous apps are being saved in memory while your phone put in rest aside. Fast and memory recollection is awesome.

"
"

  Amoled display very Sharp and vivid.Battery life excellent ...hardly 30 to 40 percent battery down if you are moderate user and not playing continuous game.OS is smooth.CAMERA need to improve , need to check software upgrades but it's not too bad ,only we need to search for better software.Finger print reader is fast.Go for 6 GB and 128 GB option so no need to worry about space issue.9611 samsung equinox processor works well no lagging observed ( i am also using 1st time this processor ...otherwise I prefer SD processor).Charging require 3 hours to full charge..it is just 15 watts charger but dont worry battery performance is great so hardly need to charge.Samsung really pack monster under 20k ( Best price offered.)Best phone offered by Samsung....go for it👌

  The box wasnt tampered at all, received in good condition. Initially it worked great and works even now, but later found some pretty signifcant heating issues with the device, especially at the top area of the screen, near front camera. Don't know the reason. Also now since last two months I am experiencing some serious screen glicthes which is irritating me now. If you all want a phone of this range, well then i suggest you to put in 2 - 3 k more and buy M51 now.CAMERA works good, wide angle photos are also good, but some details are lost at the borders of the image, the image is automatically colour corrected after each click which is okay but sometimes gets a bit too much, stabilisation isn't really what you would actually like to expect, Just fine, for vloggers any stabilizer or monopod is a must. Selfie camera is also great so heyyaa all selfie geeks, have a good timePROCESSOR is also capable of performing various tasks at same time but I would prefer you to go with SnapDragon processors in the first place.DISPLAY is something Samsung never fails to meet our expectations. AMOLED screen is truly nice, colours are vivid.FINGERPRINT sensor in this mid range phone in my opinion is good. No issues with it, good timing and speed.OVERALL, ok product to be bought at this price but then M51 is  better version of it, so i would prefer you to go with it.

  One of the best mobiles I have purchased.Pros: Amazing battery life as it has 6000 mAH battery.Awesome camera. Set it to highest quality if you dont mind space occupied 🙂.Capacity is 64GB which is pretty good.  However you have the option of having a 512 GB microsd Card. I intend to have 128GB card installed so that I can use it as an external drive of sorts 😀. Call quality is good and so is the internet speed handling. All in all very good mobile and I am quite happy using it.

  Pro:1) day battery for heavy use2) big decent screen and weight well distributed3) latest OSCons:1) very slow auto brightness2) no front proximity and light sensor, instead front camera is used for all purpose3) phone gets extra warm while charging4) cell signal not up to the mark5) wifi and mobile data switching is not seamless6) lot of bloatware,. Sometimes u will not know whether ur controlling or Samsung controlling the phone.

  I have purchased this phone in June 2020. Its the best phone in the buget. Having good camera quality, battery life is awesome. Battery lasts upto 2 days. If anyone is thinking of buying a new phone. I suggest to go with this one. I was so impressed by the phone so I have gifted this to my wife and I have purchased another one M21. M21 and M31 both the phones are excellent in budget. I like the themes and wallpaper customization of this phone. Sound is great. From my point I can fully satisfied with the phone and I can rate it full.

  I share some Tech Details.In First Photo, You see Ram in GB.(5.43 + 2.50)(Ram + Swap Memory)Swap memory work same as Ram and its good to see in Samsung. Also it provide you 7.93 GB instead of 6GB.(Maybe Swap memory use for Game boost)In Second Photo, You see the home with 5x6 grid layout.In third Photo, You see Software Details.In fourth, You see black and white photo.(idk what you call)Samsung Camera is good. Samsung also told you which look is good for shot(AI).Samsung M31 is good for gaming + work + Learning(like I learn Reverse Engineering, So need Video tutorials.. instead using pendrive i use my internal storage and super awesome, when your device comes with sAMOLED display.Battery backup is too good(6000 mAh), It something like (kab battery ktam hogi..) i use 52 hrs without puting on charging.Samsung with 6 with 128GB it's really a #MegaMonster.🤪😈

"

  Overall the phone quality is good ,but I got very much disappointed with the face recognition feature, the phone took plenty of time to unlock the phone. If the light condition in surrounding is good then it unlocks the phone other wise face could not be detected it says. Previously i had lenovo k8 whose camera quality was bad than samsun m31 still even though i tilt my mobile still it could unlock the phone an bad light also it could unlock quickly. So I am thinking that getting a better quality camera phone whichi works worst than less camera quality phone phone.

  Its been like more then 2 weeks since i am usig this phone with my primary sim.I have been testing all the features and usability this phone offers till this time and now i feel i can give my thoughts about this device.So lets make pointers:-Built: I feel the phone has amazing built Quality. Whereas Yes, the Plastic back won't feel much premium but it is actually much more practical then glass back phones. Yes it can scratch easily but who uses a phone without a cover as i would suggest to get a premium cover to get that premium feeling.Talking about Glass back phones it would be very costly to replace but the plastic shell of m31 would be much more cheaper.-Display: As you already knew its best under 20k segment. Better then other Amoled screen and No Crazy 120hz refresh rate but yeah it feels much better to use.-Software: I was using a stock android device previously and the experience of oneui is actually not bad its smooth and even fun to use. There are some hiccups here and there which is acceptable but one thing is that recent app menu lags alot while switching between apps ruining all the experience.It can be fixed via some software updates.Hardware: Phone is not heavy. The buttons are placed right, good quality buttons gives premium and positive feedback. Fingerprint sensor is fast and accurate too.-Camera: The camera quality is actually very good. All the cameras are quite usefull if you know how to use them. The Wide angle and macro camera is also good but implementation is not that great a software update can fix that too.For the night i can say that the shots are blur and grainy if you can use the camera properly then you can take some amazing shots like i do so for me the night camera is also good not great. Whereas some updates can do improvements to it.-Battery: Best battery life of any phone i have used till now. Yes the charging speed could have been better but the battery life is soo good that you will hardly rush for a charge.Note* first charge heats the device bad but after 2-3 days of usage it gets back to normal nothing to worry about. My device doesn't heatup now.My usage includes all day 2active sims, 50% brightness all day, wifi/data ON 24/7. 2hrs Gaming,1hr youtube,  Some calls, and all day social media.With a usage like this, my phone starting from 100% in the morning to 2nd day evening dropping to 25-30%. I never let my device go below that. Even the stand-by time of the phone is great.-Performance: Its fast and fluid. Whereas the ram management could be Better which can be fixed. No heating issue. Good for normal to heavy gaming. Overall the performance is Very Good of the device.This device is not specified for a single use. Its practically a straight forward device which allows the user to use it as a phone should be used. The phone doesn't offer any hanky panky Stuff for attention making anyone mad for games nor for tiktok.Verdict: If you are a rough user or you travel alot, if you are not a mad gamer then you can go for this device.It offers best practicality and usability thats how a phone should be.

  After 1 month usage, here is my review.I had been using Moto for years now but got fed up with not up to date build quality and poor performance. I am also not comfortable with UI that is far from stock android, so didnt give the chinese phones a look. So M31 was my best option.Samsung One UI with Android 10 is an absolute pleasure to navigate.6GB RAM is more than enough with 3.5 GB always available without any apps open.It multi tasks with ease.Screen is AMOLED Full HD and it completely blew your mind as a first time AMOLED user. The difference between AMOLED and normal screen is astounding. Once you get used to it, you won't be able to go back to normal screen. Best Display on a budget phone hands down.I was discouraged by other reviews saying Exynos processor is not good. However I have had no problems with it. Ofcourse if you compare its benchmarks with Snapdragon, it falls behind but that does not make it a bad processor. But trust me, looking at it alone, it is good with no problems. I haven't encountered any stutter or lag till now. Even gaming like Call of Duty and PUBG is perfect with medium settings. Ultra high drops some frames but that is expected of a budget phone. And anyway, gaming experience is perfectly fine on medium settings.Haven't yet tested camera with the lockdown going on but for normal user like me, I found it to be of good quality.Battery is a behemoth and easily lasts 1.5 days with normal usage. with 1-2 hours gaming, I need to charge it only once every morning.Because of battery its slightly on the heavy side but you wont notice because weight distribution is excellent. Feels extremely nice to hold. I strongly recommend getting a cover as the back is glossy and picks up a ton of smudges. That's the only con I experienced.Having used Moto G series and Moto X series in the past, I can safely say this is the best budget smartphone I have brought till date. Phones with specs like this used to cost 30-40k 2 years back. Absolute steal.

"
"

  First of all, I consider this phone to be excellent value for money due to high storage capacity, security functions and the quality of the camera. For me, the specs are as good I would expect from much more expensive phones. Another reason is that it is small enough to carry in a pocket. I'm not keen the large screen phones.

"
"

  This is my first attempt with Samsung as my alternative phone number. I am a dedicated & loyal iPhone user since beginning but I can confidently say that it was definitely a very good buy. Excellent features, no way behind Apple, great look, back side finger sensor is of great help to easy opening of screen lock. I took some photos , same frames both with my iPhone 11 & Samsung M31. I can definitely say Samsung captured much better snaps in terms of depth, vividness, colour & clarity. Last but not the least , value for money. I must highly recommend.

"
"

  It takes more time to charge and mobile gets heated up easily . One of the worst products the samsung has manufactured so far. Really upset with the processor and battery life.  More than 3 hours of time it takes to charge up.one day battery. please dont purchase this product guys . Go for A series in samsung. Camera quality  is not as good as A series in Samsung & oppo. Fingerprint reader nice.

"

  Best features, Ergonomics: The two best things about the phone are its 6000 mah battery and its weight balance which makes it feel way lighter than its 192 grams. The polycarbonate back means you don't need a case and can use this phone bareback which is nice(just rub down with a damp cloth from time to time to get rid of the fingerprints) A faux leather back would have been better but nothing much to complain about. Battery: On the battery front, the performance is exceptional(7.5 hours on lte and medium brightness, and 13 hours on wifi) and if you switch off the phone and charge, it can charge up from 20% in under 2 hours. Camera: The camera was really bad out of the box but got a massive upgrade in especially low light images after the February patch. Samsung are likely to further improve the camera with updates. One irritation currently is that you can't use the flash and the wide angle at the same time which makes no sense. Performance: Performance is good for day to day tasks especially if you go to the settings and ""reduce animations"" You can also use ram and cache cleaning apps on the playstore to clean your ram and cache with a single click from time to time. Hardware: Gyroscope and compass are there. Samsung used to skimp on these in the past. A macro lens is also available along with the ultrawide. Unfortunately no IR blaster and no zoom lens(depth sensor instead) Also no Samsung Pay or Knox securityDisplay: The display gets better if you tweak it. Out of the box, you get somewhat warm colors. You can also hide the notch the same way as the M30s(look it up on YouTube) Because it is an amoled screen, this works perfectly and you get an uninterrupted display. Overall good experienceSound: The sound of the earphone jack is not punchy but there is no distortion or noise either so good for soft music. You can probably improve the output further with a third party equalizer. The single speaker is clear and reasonably loud. No distortion and good for speech. But not punchy or good for playing music(but then that's what Bluetooth speakers are for)Software: You get Android 10 out of the box. I had heard that some people had trouble with using vpn apps after an Android 10 update but fortunately that's not true. Only software con so far is that a native screen recorder is not a available out of the box(so there may be no way of recording internal audio) Further you can't sideload apps from a third party file explorer. You have to use the built in one. We have to see if it improves with updates. Also you have a screen flash and camera flash feature you can turn on for notifications in the absence of a led notification light Who should buy: People who want the sharpest data capture on their camera and the best gaming performance may look elsewhere, but if you want a reliable rom(I have had files corrupted, especially those on the micro sd card on multiple occasions with MIUI especially during updates), top class battery life, good customer service, and a good quality amoled screen with perfect notch hiding, this is a really good phone. The lack of Samsung Pay is annoying and the main reason for cutting a star. Other things like the older processor were already on the table

  Pros:Amazing Screen QualityOne UISamsung branding and serviceMacro PhotographyCons:Despite 6000mAh, I did not find it to be great. It was just good.Coming from an iPhone, I felt android phones' are way behind in Image processing techniques. Realized that pixel MP values are just to lure people and the real power of a camera lies in the Image processing.Rest everything is normal like every other phone.If you want to buy a Samsung 4GB RAM phone and macro photography doesn't matter for you, go for the M21. But If you are going for a 6GB phone, I would recommend you to spend those extra Rupees and get this M31.

"
"

  Overall saying, Samsung M31 works goodPros1. Amazing camera2. Nice screen size and coverage3. Fingerprint sensor is good4. No heating issues5. Speed is quite amazing (you can quickly jump from one app to other, without worrying about hanging issues).6. Soft touch screen which I like mostCons1. Battery life is not as good as expected (you can pull off one day without charge if you spend 60% time of your work hours on phone)2. Face recognizer is extremely poor3. The phone is bit heavy as compared to others I have used so farIn overall terms, i will give 4.5 stars to M31 and I guess it will be a great phone for anyone who wants to try Samsung phone.

"

  I have been using this phone for over a month now. I need to charge once every two days, which is a major time saver. COnnectivity is good. I used to have connectivity issues with my previous phone, which was a big botheration. There are only areas that I have a bit of a concern. 1. the width of the phone is a bit narrow which, because of my thick fingers creates some typing challenges. 2. I wish the charging cable was 0.5 meter longer.Overall a good phone.

  M31 is one of the best mid tier, made in India, ""budget smartphone"" out there right now for people looking for an upgrade from their entry level smartphones. The super AMOLED display, 6000mAh battery, 128 GB storage and a Samsung Exynos processor, that's a little better from the top of the line 600 series Qualcomm Snapdragon line of processors are the strongest selling points. The UI occupies a lot of RAM, 1.8 GB on an average, and the battery performance isn't mind-blowing, it's great 1&1/2 days of usage easily (playing some games, watching YouTube for 3-5 hours), which you'd expect from a 6000mAh battery (I expected a little more). The camera is great, macro shots are well lit and crisp, 64MP main sensor senses colour pretty well, and the wide angle isn't all that great, but it gets the job done, hyperlapse, slomo features are a great addition. Front facing camera is ""okayish"". The phone feels heafty and sturdy to the touch, and feels responsive overall, transitions to background apps are a bit jittery, but I believe it's a UI issue, and not a performance issue. PUBG runs well, if you plan to play casually. Overall, I've been using this phone for over a month now, and I have no major complain. Totally recommend it.

  Really a good budget phone with big battery. Camera performance also awesome, but in pro mode there no control for shutter speed and while changing the iso i don't feel any differences. I need more update on camera modes. Phone performance and charging speed is good. Except camera modes i love this phoneThe battery life is very very good .fingerprint reader is rear fingerprint reader and is very fast and aslo to be screen capture spped .camera quality is very good and pictures takenAre very sharp and neat charger is 15w so it takes morebthan 2 hours to charge the battery full mobile is not much weight the weight management is very good The display is s amoled display and is very good.face unlock takes clear in morning and at night time it is not working. AND the overall I will give 9/10 To samsung M31

"
"

  I love its simple design,one ui 2 and the sAmoled display,battery life is also good.But the camera quality is not that good as it has a 64 MP shooter... Its images are blurred and there's too much noise in it when using night mode...there's a lot of difference between normal vdo taking and with Steady mode on( vdo quality is not that good and there's noise)I bought this phone and after day 4..it started hanging while opening Amazon app..the menu hangs sometimes..so i replaced it..When opening.. the replaced phone has some software issues like the data disconnect randomly on its own for some time and while this happens i cant connect calls to anyone..first it doesn't ring..then even if the call is picked up on the other side..i didn't get to hear the voice..and when the hand up the call it still shows call on progress...and i have no network problem in my area..and all my other phones are working perfectly. I am very much irritated by this..so I'm returning the M31..

"
"

  Honestly I Like Samsung M31 so much that one by one I buyed total 3 Mobiles and two of my friends also buyed after getting a good feedback from my end, Camera quality is so awesome, shared few clicks above clicked by my samsung M31, main screen have a full coverage,  battery back is just just awesome I mean it has a very good battery backups, mobile processing, camera quality, multiprocessoring and internet make up feel like not to apart from your Samsang M31.

"
"

  First of all I would like to say stop using Chinese products.  Avoid chinese products. That's why I bought Samsung m31 and not Redmi Vivo OnePlus oppo realme xaomi. Best phone in this range. Better than all above. Wn u boycott chinese products u feel proud and u feel patriotic. Fingerprint reader is fast. Battery life is very long. Camera quality is best.

"
"

  amazing handset in price segment, great features, most and important is don't want to by MI as its origin from Virus country, I feel my contribution towards India and exchange MI with this device.I insist to all great Indians, never by from Virus country and replace or return if you own it.

"
"

  This phone is not as good as we expected. I bought it on 18 March 2020. So I am using it for more than 4 months. I was super excited while I saw the features like battery, camera, screen size all in my budget. But from past 1 month, I am facing an issue. Sometimes while I use the camera or watching a video and sometimes while I play the game into it, its screen gets completely black. If within 4 months I am facing this issue then I don't expect that it will work even for a year. Completely disappointed with Samsung. I won't go for Samsung in future.

"
"

  I purchased this phone for my dad. But i used it for 4-5 days. And on that basis i can say that:• The performance of the phone is very smooth. I don't find any hanging problem.• The battery life of this phone is amazing. If you are using your phone without internet then the battery life works for 3-5 days.• The camera quality of the rear is nice but front cam is not up to that point. It's like you are using front cam with an beauty editor.• As you all know about the screen, it's just awesome.• And other functions of the phone starts properly.Before purchasing this phone. I compared it to many of the smartphones. And trust me this tops at first in this range. So, if your budget is around 15000 u can go for it without any doubt.

"

  Purchsed one on launch. Had almost made up my mind to buy M30s but saw notification of this M31 being launched so kept my purchase on hold. The features were good at the price. The wait was worthy. Now using almost since 3 months.Truely monster battery. With my use easily lasts bit more than 2 days. Fast charging supported. 50% charged within about 40 min with the provided 9V charger. This is sufficient for a day if one is in hurry to leave for work. By the time one gets ready the phone can be charged 50% almost.Full charge takes about 2.30 hrs. Samsung should have provided a 15 V charger in box as they provide to all the YouTube reviewers. All reviewers spoke of inbox 15W charger.I would have given 5 star rating in all categories then.The finger print scanner occasionally fails to unlock with finger print. Have to press the lock button and unlock again with the finger then. Don't know the reason why this happens.Though I am not a selfie lover or one who keeps on clicking photos often, I found the camera quality good enough, both front and back.Sound quality is ok. Though feel the speaker could have been bit louder.No doubts about Samsung amoled display, it's the best. Samsung being pioneer in this. Very bright even with low settings.Signal reception has no problem.Expandable memory is a good feature we usually do not see now in flagship phones also.Overall good product at this price. Go for it.

  Very Good Features. You just can't compare with 2 yrs back Samsung mid range smartphones.  they were really not value for money. but now situation is different.  the screen is really superb. everything is good except face lock. and the best part is it's a very trustable brand. nowadays privacy is the biggest concern and after hearing about the Xiaomi's case i am not gonna trust any chinese brand. i have poco f1 too but now the situation is different and i will not trust any chinese brand again. It's a promise

"
"

  M31 is a very good option to purchase, very nice immersive S-Amoled screen, good camera, decent battery life all packaged in a pretty slim and light weight package.Pros:Whats are the features one should go for1) Immersive screen experience2) Decent battery life (lasts for approx. 1.5 days with normal usage)3) Dimensions and weight is just perfect so it doesn't feel too heavy neither its very difficult for one hand usage4) Camera quality is very good for day light5) Fingerprint reader is also very responsiveCons:1) Images in night light are not very sharp2) The silicon back cover is not included in the package (these days almost all mobile in this range have back cover included)

"
"

  Pros:1. Massive battery,2. Brilliant display as well as quality of display. Watching youtube videos or movie is fun in this phone.3. Camera is ok ok.Cons:1. Phone is heating up while charging and playing games.2. High charging time (20%-100% take more than 2 hours 40 minutes).3. Processor is not good. It could've been best phone if comes with Snapdragon medium range processor.I will update the review if I explore something new.

  Best thing about this Mobile is the BIG Battery & of course the Display is Top Notch.~ For Gaming also mobile fine, some say exynos is not that good vs Snapdragon chipsets but after using for 1st time i would say, not at all disappointed, because see if u can play Pubg in High settings and there not much heat then what else do you need, though there seems to be some lagging issue in higher settings for PUBG Graphics but basic & ultra settings works perfectly 👌.~ No issues with Sims (Airtel/ Jio)~ Best Display i have ever used (AMOLED)~ Sound quality also very good with speaker & also with earphones, atleast way better than my previous mobile (Moto X 4)~6000 Mah BATTERY ❤️ can't beat that with this price seriously 💯 easily works for whole day, on normal use u may get 30% on next day too,My location, Bluetooth, is always on for fitness band so with all these + fb, YouTube, insta , regular browsing, WhatsApp, pubg for 2-3 hours, i still get 25 - 35% at the night or next day morning, this is the best thing about this Mobile (Full Paisa wasoool hai 💯)~ 6gb Ram is quite good- nowadays u need atleast 6gb for smooth working, i haven't seen any hanging issues till now even after rough use believe me~ ONE UI 2.0 : I normally prefer clean stock android phones like Motorola, all my previous phones were from Motorola but u know it sucks now so wanted buy mid range with near clean stock android phone, so this my 1st Samsung Mobile, earlier i never liked Samsung because of there UI, but with ONEUI all is fine u get android 10 with all the Google features.~ Performance is also goodOverall i would definitely recommend this Mobile at this price range (i got this for 15,999)

  I'm using my Samsung Galaxy M31 for more than a month and now reviewing it.Below are the details that I feel and have have experienced during my usage.- sAmoled display: The best display one can get in the price range. It truely give flagship phone like experience in mid price range phone.- Bettery: Single charge works for me for more than 1.5 day almost with 3-4 hours daily calls, 2-3 hours daily live streaming, 24 hours net connected. It gets 15W fast charge which takes almost 3 hours to charge this power house from less than 10% to full charge.- Camera: quad camera setup does it job well. 64MP Primary camera takes decent photos in day light. Live focus also works great. Macro is fine too. Ultra wide mode is also good. Though it has night mode but shows noise. 32 MP front camera is best in this segment.Processor: Exynox 9611 works absolutely fine for day to day life. I'm not a gamer so not sure about gaming performance. Apps open without any issue and don't feel any lag.UI: One UI also gives the best experience. It is very smooth and easy to use.The other good thing about this phone is that Samsung is providing McAfee security in this phone which no one will find in Chinese phones.So if you have the budget of 17-18k for new smart phone and want to get smooth and best experience in this price range, please go ahead and buy this phone. But if you less budget around 14k the go for Galaxy M21 in which one will get tri camera setup instead of quad in M31 and have 64GB internal memory which should also be sufficient and rest of the features list are same as M31.

  worst experience from samsung i did not expect from samsung . after 25 days of use suddenly phone just off, and i went to service center and produced it they make lot of obligation for producing handset because of online product and worst experience for me . after all documents box provided the open a jobsheet for me it take 6hours for producing my set in line . after horrible experience started again after another 22 days they  said ur mobile is dead and board is not available , i was shocked and they gave a coupon cost of 17500 to purchase their product only in their main store. i went to their stores more than three terrible experience and one store dealer of samsung accepted, in one condition that they only sell on mrp , then i asked my same product but unfortun that not available . i have to gave extra 2500 FOR ANOTHE PURCHASE WORST SAMSUNG EXPERIENCE .IT IS BETTER TO PURCHASE ANOTHER BRANDS THEN SAMSUNG WORST SAMSUNG

  A big NO for gamers but simply awesome things are -1. of course the AMOLED Display.2. 6000mAh battery3. Main 64MP Samsung sensor with good image quality.4. wifi calling feature.5. dedicated SD Card slotBut some other facts to consider -1. in Pro mode camera 'shutter speed control' and 'focus control' is missing.2. Volume Rocker and power button are cheap plastic, although it gives good tactile feedback.3. have to very careful through the setup process, otherwise, you will get lots of unwanted notifications.4. you need a good protective cover to prevent scratches.5. Charger cable/Data cable, provided is short.6. u will feel Battery is taking so much juice to compare to snapdragon SoC, because of Exynos 9611 processor. but u 'll get 1.5-2 days of battery for normal usage.... I hope this will help u to decide before buying this phone.

  Writing this review after 1 week of use age:Did extensive research before picking this up on Amazon and felt this phone is value for money in this price segment when compared against other brands which have similar featuresPros:- Premium Design- Easy to handle- Good Cameras ( both front and rear)- Monster Battery- Good RAM/ Memory which helps you store moreCons:- Takes a long time to charge, other than I wasn’t able to come across anything as of now but looking forward to use this mobile for a long time.Thanks Amazon!

  Two times touch screen fully stuck up. I press volume button and switch off button 7 second for rebute as Samsung site instructions ,then only touch screen worked. I want to return the mobile. when I clicked on replace option in Amazon, there is no option to return. Then I called Amazon . Amazon fixed technician visit. August17 th delivered, 19 th fixed visit, I was waiting 19 th in my home. But a rescheduled technician visit after 20 days. So called Amazon , told about too late schedule, and informed mobile camera showing very dim pictures and videos are same condition and youtube videos are same condition.Again they fixed techinican visit 21 st. I was waiting 21 st in home. But again rescheduled message is came for September 09 , I called Amazon , Amazon offered replacement. New mobiles delivered 24th. Delevery boy told to check mobile. He was waiting 10 minutes to check mobiles. 64 mp camera performance as  32 mp camera in night. Day times its 64 mp camera performance better than mi 48 mp camera. 64 mp camera can use in 3:4 ratio only . A major drawback is 64 mp camera have no zoom facilitie.0therthan 64 mp camera In photo mode there have a 4 optios as 3:4, 9:16, 1:1, full. All have zoom facilitie .  Macro camera is working. Mobiles thickness is too heavy so feel size and weight too heavy. Normally I did not need finger print. So I didn't use it. After some days only I can told about battery performance.

  Nice display and battery backup. Don't expect perfomance. Good for candy crush level games. Processor is old. At this price today's competition you'll get better ones. Let's be honest. Camera is pathetic. No difference between 16 and 64 MP . I am not a 'mobile gamer' since this device can't do much in there. Also lots of bloatware by samsung. Unnecessary waste updates and apps. Only good things is the battery backup and display. Sound not so great. I don't know why they put a Dolby feature. No change in sound in headphones. Its a Dummy . Speaker an average performer.. Fanboys can suck it. No need to spend this much money for the crappy perfomance. I bought it for 17499 for 6 GB 128 GB variety. Body is cheap plastic. One of the worst kind .Glass breaks easily

  Unlike any other Samsung smartphone this smartphone is most value for money as it has many features while Samsung kept it's price within 20 k.Camera quality at this price is good. However it claims that it has 64 mega pixel what it does it it compile multiple shots to make it 64 mega pixel , let's not dive in technicality, it has good speaker sound, buy a cover as it is very slippery,  u will get only charger and mobile phone in the box.

  So, you decided to purchase the M31, based on its ratings and reviews? Then you must think about the following facts if you want to buy it:1. If you have more money, go for a higher priced phone like A70s. This phone has the features of other phones which are in the price bracket of 18k-22k.2. The battery backup is very good, my phone lasts 3 days on a single charge, with WiFi on all day, 2-3 hours of browsing throughout the day and moderate calling of 1-2 hours per day. However, if you want to exploit the phone by playing games all day long, you have to charge the phone everyday. Games run smooth, but this is not a gaming phone. You should target something in the price bracket of 35k+ for that purpose.3. Phone is sturdy and looks great. Drop it from a height of 2 feet and it will be okay. Spray water on it, and still it will be ok.4. Camera is really good for normal photography including slow mo, fast shutter speed, good colour reproduction, and daytime photography. Night time photography is decent, but don't expect it to perform like a 50k phone. It will produce photos like a 20k phone should.5. Charging time is around 2.5 hours if you are on 0% charge. But it charges very fast to 85%. So, if you start charging it from 40%, it will take around 30-45 minutes to get fully charged.6. Phone does not get hot under any circumstances, does not hand, does not restart.7. Phone display is very bright, even in bright sunlight.8. Phone UI is good, with some bloatware like NETFLIX.9. Headphone is not given with phone.

  After using 1week I am writing this.First, I would like to thanks Amazon for their service, I got the phone before estimated deliver date.Design of the phone is good.Battery is just awesome. With a moderate use it is giving fully two days service.Camera is also awesome in this price range in both day and night mode. But it can't say as 64MP.There is no heating and lagging problem till now.Charging is very fast. But one thing I found as cons, it's network capturing quality is little worse as compared to Vivo mobile phones.  Otherwise it is a quality product. I would like to suggest everybody to go with this phone.

  the samsung M31 -the finger print sensor works great and is sensitive enough .the display of the mobile is very good as compared to the price .i have been using this mobile for 9 days now .the camera  the picture quality is really not good.it comes with tons of preloaded applications and looks like a mess.battery dies in 9 hrs if used continuously.No fast charging as they claims.the length of the lead of the charger is too small .i would suggest to rather buy a Mi mobile which will come cheap from this and will have all the features that this has and 5k less.

"
"

  I wonder why a lot of negative comments are there in amazon regarding this phone. I took the risk to buy it even after reading all those negative reviews. And I'm completely satisfied with the device.M31 is a very nice phone with an amazing camera clarity, wonderful display and excellent battery life. I really love it.I've added some images(macro shots) that I'd taken with my M31. For me,  its the perfect one I ever had. I've been using samsung for almost 7 years. Had some hang issues with my old device which is Galaxy J5. But M31 is just wow. If you are in search of a phone with a good camera, lasting battery life, best performance with a well known branding,  don't think twice. Go for it. You can completely trust it, after all its SAMSUNG.❤️👌.

  Shameful performance from the Specs provided.. STAY AWAY FROM SAMSUNG!!!!! FOR AN EXAMPLE, Click the button and the camera and the latest Android version takes 3 seconds to capture a photo. Till then, the subject has moved on.Not to mention, the super subpar performance for everything else.Worst performer, the accellometer. Take 10 seconds, get frustrated, turn the phone aronud, then the vertical mode gets activated.Absolutely ashamed of my purchase. MY FAULT. Not SAMSUNGS. THEY ARE A BUNCH OF PROFITEERING KOREANS, who are looking to close in on the HATE CHINESE funda that has been brought on by the current admin.

  Believe me guys this is the best overall package u can get under 18k i have just brought a 64gb variant from amazon at 16k and trust me guys it exceeded my expectationsFirstly lets talk about the cons or negative points of the phone1. The polycarbonate back is a fingerprint magnet and is quite slippery applying a cover is  Highly reccomended2. The glass on the front is highly fragile and gets easily cracked. So applying a tampered glass is necessary.3. The front camera performs very poor in low light4. The fast charging is enabled by default but the battery backup is around 9hrs but if i disable fast charging i could get around 12 hrs of screen on time again that is a good thing because u can just charge it at night as it takes around 4 and half hours to charge completelyNow lets talk about pros:1. Guys the first u will notice is its display and its amazing its the best u can get under 20k 60hz amoled is  way better than 120 or 90 hz ips lcd panels in realme poco etc the display is equivalent to the one on oneplus 7 so it gives a flagship experience it looks better than punch hole ips lcd displays.2. Camera is just amazing dont look at the reviews on you tube cuz the 64 mp sensor is almost same on every device so u can just edit the images and adjust white bala ce exposure etc and get the same images on all the devicesIn the competition3. Software experience: Trust me guys the software experience on samsung is at next level and u will feel it only when u use it by yourself whether its the music application or even the alarm theme or its the themes collection or the user interface it gives u the flagship level experience and u wont feel u are using a midrange phone as one ui on samsung is highly customizable. Talking about the performance believe me u wont find a bit of difference in real life usage between the snapdragon and exynos 9611 it gives a lag free experience as the one ui 2 is highly optimized and pubg runs on highest setting which u can't run on snapdragon 720g equipped smartphones.If u are planning to buy this smartphone just go for it its better than the competition

  What a defective piece received from Amazon. Unable to return the defective product as the return window closed before returning it.Very inconvenient service from Amazon.I urge Amazon to take my defective mobile phone back and give me the full refund asap.

  Purchased this phone 6 weeks backPro's1. Elegant look2. Easy to handle3. Good cam4. Almost Nil noise in the pictures5. Display is good. Gorilla glass does its job well. No hassles as of now6. Battery life is good.Cons1. No back cover provided by the manufacturer. Redmi provides the same for such phones.2. The display developed problems. There was a blue patch developing in the right side of the screen. Informed the same to service centre. They say it will take more than a month.

"
"

  Pros:1. Good battery life, after one day of moderate usage with hotspot on I am getting about 24 hrs aming 8 hrs of hotspot2. Excellent display3. Cam better than china brands4. No heating issues while using5. Gud performance with 6gb ram6. Processor performance is satisfying7. Even for gamers it is gud mobileCons:1. Out of 6 gb Ram 4 gb to 4.3 gb of ram is used by system and u should clear it manually to free up2. Lil bit of heating while charging but lesser than china brands.3. Who wish a full screen water drop front cam is an obstacle4. Got marks at the edges when delivered which i tried cleaning but they are mocro dents. Which could be ignored.

  Very good phone in this range, I bought coz I don't want to buy chinese phones, I am not a fan of SS coz of its galaxy series OS, but now it appears they have updates UX quite bit.Battery Life: Superb I do charge once in two days.Screen size: very good.Camera: has good features and have good quality but sometimes it appears images are getting stretched at edges. Slow Mo option is superb to add your own song in video.Hardware is good I do play sniper 3D and other shooting games without hesitation.

  Cons,I had been using redmi phone before this , that phone had 4gb ram but it never hanged  (same apps and games). Processing was much better than this one. Inbuilt apps like compass , date and time on clicked picture was there . Fringer print sensor was much better on that phone.Camera quality,  3.5starsBuild quality. 3 starsBattery,5starDisplay 4starBluetooth Connectivity 4 starScree mirroring  4.5starSound without head phone or such device 2.5star.Sound with headphones. 3.5star.Fingertip sensor. 2 starSlow start and hanging  problem in 100 days of uses.

  This phone is truly fantastic in this price range.Am writing this review after using for a week.Pros:1. 6000 mah battery is really a monster.2. Camera is excellent.3. Touch sensitivity and fingerprint readers are very goodCons:1. Phone is hanging sometime while unlocking and sometimes while using apps. This might be due to software. I can this came be overcome through updates.2. Observed little heat, after using it for 45 minutes audio call

"
"

  First of all let me tell you that previously I have used Nokia Lumia &  iPhone 6.I'm writing this review after 7 days of usage, using the 128GB version.Wonderful delivery experience by Amazon.Battery backup(6000MAh) is just awesome.Very very smooth processor, as compared to other phones in this price range like Oppo and Mi. Works like a flash.Camera Quality is awesome.Display is greatNo problem of overheating while usage or charging.Overall, I would totally recommend you to go for Samsung Galaxy M31, as at this price range, with the specs & brand value of Samsung, this is the best buy. 👍

"
"

  Consider Other choices also.Quality 6.4 AMOLED Display in FHD, that is  very comfortable to hold inspite of the mega battery that lasts more than a full day with really heavy usage.Screen on time is easily 13-14 hrs after a full charge ,that takes around 2.5 hrs. So no more worries.Touch sensitivity is very good.speaker volume ,call volume, reception are all adequate.Core UI 2 performs well with android 10 out of box and prompt me to update to latest patch on initial setup.No visible lag in daily use with DDR4 ram and UFS 2.1 memory. Finger print reader is snappy with no delay. Gamers may not find the same level of performance in exynos processor as a snapdragon .Camera performance is good in the daylight.Night mode not good with little enhancements.Wide lens is OK,macro shots are average.Camera software has lot of options to explore. Video recording comes with EIS.selfie also poor.Build quality is not OK considering the plastic back while competitors are offering gorilla glass panel.No notification LED.Network signal is very poor compared to my old lenova.Think twice before buying since only replacement is offered by Amazon.

"
"

  Been 2 months using this phone. Overall performance is good. Went ahead and chose this product because didn't wanted to go for Chinese brands.Less rating because only after 2 month of use suddenly touch pad stopped working. Wend ahead forced power off/on it worked. But only to become unresponsive next morning. Immediately rushed to samsumg cerive center in Malleshwaram Bangalore. They checked and replaced entire touch and screen panel free of cost as it was under warranty.This might be one of rare case but it happened with my device only.All other features 5 star camera, battery and user experience.

  The Samsung galaxy M31 is the best phone to buy under Rs.20.000 I purchased the samsung brand after gap of 2 years. The phone is worth buying for following reasons.1.Camera quality.(both front and back camera are awesome)2.Fingerpoint reader and face reader works very fast.3.The 6000mah Monster battery works for two days easily even for heavy user4.The super amoled screen in this price range is great.I strongly recommend this phone to all the buyers.Thank you SAMSUNG

"
"

  I am using this for more than 6 months. Samsung has really upgraded the software glitches those used to create UI slowness.Pros:1. Camera is best2. Lightweight even after having 6000mAH battery3. Fingerprint sensor is very quick4. Display has wide color range and quite bright5. No software lag6. Best for multitasking7. Blue light filter is really helpful8. The motion stability is pretty useful. It is quite fascination to see that it never feels like the video has ever been shot with the phone holdin in the hands.9. The camera captures images with natural colors, not with punchy color like some other phones do.Cons:1. In Macro mode it is hard to focus on object, but it is rarely used2. Night mode could have been a bit better with grain reduction and with more brightness

"
"

  I've had the phone for 22days now. The finger print reader is fast, no inconsistencies at all. It's better than some indispaly print readers.I like the screen, initially wanted the Galaxy A71 for its 6.7"" screen, but once I had this delivered I realised a 6.4"" screen was more than I needed.The battery lasts for about 18hrs, after which I am left with about 24-28% charge (after heavy usage).Which light usage  I have gotten well over 24hrs on a single charge.One thing I can tell you though, is to slap a sturdy case on the phone immediately after purchase.

"
"

  No guest mode, the only major drawback.Galaxy store downloads application without permission from user.You can hide applicaton but it would be hidden without security. With big battery, one has to deal with weight also.Camera is superawesome. It even captures the sunlight without making dark pictures. But there is no focus available in slefie mode. If image is captured through whatsapp camera, it will automatically crop the image everytime.

"
"

  It is a very good product battery life is good it lasts two days camera is amazing it is very clear the ultra wide lens in awesome front camera is also good the fingerprint sensor is very good it is fast also and face unlock is also good game booster is anazing the games are very smooth the system does not have any bugs but inside the you usually get a transparent case but this doesn't have it and the screen guard also the system is really smooth and android 10 is also amazing this phone does not heat up like other phones and its display is amazing its sound quality is also good you can dolby with bt headset and with earphones i say it is  very good

"
"

  Hi All,Please don't buy this scrap from Samsung.I ordered it on the very first day of the launch and turned out to be a great mistake.The most important feature of any mobile  is making and receiving calls and this phone has problem with that only..All calls irrespective of dailed or received gets disconnected automatically within a minute.When I searched for this problem, found out that there are thousands of people who have the same problem.You can Google it yourself to see the harsh reality.Please don't but this.

"

  Best device around 16k-17k. Overall 4.2/5.Build quality not good. I mean just nice. If i rate it then 3/5. Actually the back of the device is made with polycarbonate so If it were glass, it would be the best all-rounder device in this budget.Screen just superb. 4.7/5.Camera quality also nice. 4/5.Performance also good. I used Samsung J7 prime for 2 and half years. So i know what is the problem with exynos processor. So there exynos 9611 also good processor for approx 2 years. But then this is behave just a 7k-8k budget device. If there was a Snapdragon 712 or 720G processor, it would definitely be rocking device from SAMSUNG under 20k budget. Okay  but the current performance is really smooth and cool. So 4/5.Fingerprint scanner good but also have face unlock option so no problem for device lock security. Both work fine. 4/5.Battery gives approx a day with medium usage. 4/5But charging time really slow. 6000 mAh battery takes time to getting full charge around 2.5 hours. 3/5. Ok let's talk. I think i covered all the pros and cons. Then you decide that what should you do, buy or not buy. If you ask me then definitely go for it if you watch movie and video with decent gaming. I don't think of any other mobile for watching movies or videos. The screen just AWESOME. That's all.

"
"

  Phone is okay type, only plus point is the battery life which is really good.The piece is slightly heavy piece.The antutu benchmark details are enclosed.Finger print reader is real quick. But face scanner is too shabby as it takes time to unlock.

"
"

  This device is best...super fast performance with oxygen OS. Super Amoled screen is awesome.you will enjoy watching video or browsing.Battery is awesome ..it gives 24 hours of battery backup with full usage once full charged otherwise with moderate usage it gives almost 2 days of battery backup.Charging is quite slow and it takes 3 hours to get fully charged but it is worth for usage of 24 to 36 hours. Camera is also superb with super video UHD recording. By default it comes with 32 Mpixel but user can change to 64Mpixel and click awesome pictures. MUST Buy if looking for stunning device in this particular budget. I have used almost for a week and then reviewing it.

"
"

  I wish I could give 6 stars to the battery life... Just amazing. I'm not a very heavy user so i get about 2 days backup. I switched on to power saver at 30% once and got one full day extra, can't imagine how long would it last on ultra power saver.The camera is really good and beautifully captures all colours.The screen is flawless. Amoleds, as you'd expect!The fingerprint is a bit slow sometimes but is quick to unlock. The responsiveness decreases for a short time if you've just turned the phone on.The software is awesome. The out-of-the-box software is a bit unstable but a recent update fixed it. Clean and shiny interface but with a few apps preinstalled, which can be uninstalled.I don't play much games but I played CoD and what a gameplay it gives... Smooth as butter. Overheats if you play for long although performance decrease is not too much.Thanks!

  Pros.1. Super display to watch movies, YouTube and web series.2. Excellent battery backup, min 2 days at moderate usage3. Excellent cameras at this price rangeboth front and rear camera perform very well in all lighting conditions.4. Portrait image with both front and rear very good and good edge detection5. Video quality also good and auto focus is also very fast6. Fast processor handles multitasking smoothly7. Gaming and graphics are manage very well, very smooth experience8. Touch sensitivity is nice Cons1. Build quality should have been better than this as no frame is used and cheap plastic is used at the back.2. Gorilla glass 5 should have been given instead of gorilla 3.3. Charging time is almost 2 to 3 hours from 0 to 100%4. Brightness lacks in sunlight5. Dual speakers should have been given instead of mono speakerOverall must buy product compared to other brands in market at this price point.All features are upto the mark as mentioned in the featues nothing lacks behind.

  Never buy phones from Amazon. They have sent me defective phone. It is switches off several times,  this phone is not even receiving network properly. Internet speef is like 2g and people on the other end always complain about my voice getting cut and low voice during the call. I was assuming that due to lockdown Network is weak. But its been two months I have been facing same problem and have realized the phone is defective. Amazon is not ready to replace the phone. This is my first and last phone from Amazon.

  Likes6 GB RAM128 GB internal storage6000 MAH batteryContinuous screenshotEditing screenshot is nice and easyMy battery lasts for 1.5 days in medium battery saver modeDislikesContinuous screenshot is limited uptown a particular screen length..it doesn't go through end..so only two pages screenshot of whatsapp chat message is possible..ideally this phone should allow screenshot till the endIf you have more apps then battery usage in background will drain the battery faster..the battery will not last for more than 20 hours so I keep my phone in moderate battery saver modeSometimes changing settings is more tedious so you can't change settings by pulling down settings screen while you are driving

  I was certain that I will not be buying any Chinese product and unfortunately most of the products within my price range of 15 - 20K are Chinese phones. After doing loads of reviews I bought Samsung M31.Verdict: Build quality is great except the back could be a little harder, Camera quality is good but please do not get misled with 64MP quadra camera as it will make your expectation damn high. Overall wonderful pictures with good clarity but with lower configuration, my S9+ takes better pics. The sound quality is awesome. The screen is super awesome. Games played so far is only Roblox, CoC, and 8-ball pool and they ran perfectly without any lag. The battery ran for straight 2 days with a 100% charge with medium usages. Wifi Connectivity is very good but like any other Samsung phone, the phone network and the internet is a little slaggy. didn't find any heating issues so far. Overall I will definitely recommed everyone to buy this with closed eyes if you want to buy a Non Chinese phone at this price range as it is perfect.

  I really hate Amazon For this..I have spent almost 17000 for my pocket money and thought that it's a trusted app to order mobile but I was wrong..Don't go to the best reviews of people , they are Just a 😤..I ordered my mobile from here after read the best reviews of people and Spent lots of money in this Pandemic situation but my decision was wrong as I receive the phone with 6000 mah.which never works for one day..Battery drains too fast as it's like 1000 mah battery .Earlier I had 5000 mah battery mobile but it almost runs 2 days as I have lots of work through phone that why I had choosen this long time 6000 mah battery mobile but they shows lots of functions In the mobile but it was totally fake and wastage..kindly help me or guide me what can I do now.?

"
"

  Though this mobile has scaled up very well with 6000 mah battery but still having the heating issues while charging.If you are looking for a multi tasking mobile which shouldn't get hang easily, then please don't go for this productOnly one positve thing is the camera which is really good in thia

  I give this Review after 15 days of purchase.I got this phone on Rs. 15999/- Thanks to SBI Credit card offer gave me 1500Rs discounts.Thanks to Amazon for very fast service when purchase this phone Delivery timing is 15 days but I got this phone in 5 days. Truly Amazing Amazon. When I was Purchasing this phone  I have not interested in camera features because I purchase this phone for professional use and ruff and stuff use. But I am surprise when I seen the camera clearity and features that was beyond my expectations.The best battery life I ever use. I am continuing watch study or entertainment Video in high brightness. No need to carry the charger with me in office.This is my second Samsung Phone I am giving Reviews from my My old phone Samsung galaxy J7Prime. I use this phone from last 4 year and this is also working properly. I purchase new phone just because of Internal storage full issue.We love the Samsung product and Amazing Amazon service.Highly Recommended Samsung M31.

"
"

  As my previous review was not posted now I'm reviewing this again as the battery backup as mentioned was not up to the mark and speakers are look cheap, don't know why I paid so much better to go for MI brand

"
"

  Firstly I was impressed by the delivery of the phone it was in my hand in just 10 hours after I book the phone in Amazon. Great job from Amazon.Coming to M31, Really it's a monster. Unfortunately It got slipped from my hand on day 1 itself from 3ft but there is no scratch in the screen and there is only a minor rash on side panel. The battery was a beast and gives pretty good enough time to use the phone for long time. Camera was nice and overall phone performance was awesome. Really good product  from SAMSUNG.

  6k battery is its usp.Not at all bulky considering it has a 6k batteryIt comes with latest android version 10 n Samsungs 1UI 2.0.Smooth performance. 128 gm memory is enough for an above average user same with 6gb ram.Nice camera with great options. Same with selfie camera. Pics in low light/night could be better but guess its a software thing that samsung would fix in the future updates.Would have loved a metal body and on screen fingerprint sensor but yes can't expect everything at this price. Fullyloaded mobile at this price and best thing is its made in India.

  This is my first Samsung phone after a very long gap. It has got simple and minimal design that looks good. Speed is good and phone works smoothly.However, within days of purchase I am finding that UI is functioning erratically sometimes. Certain apps may not start and phone is getting hanged. Sometimes it goes to some kind of sleep mode and after that it takes ages to be revived, sometimes even have to restart.Sorry Samsung. I am disappointed.

  I have purchased 6+128 blue variant model.Review given: After 27 days of usagePros:1) definitely the battery life (gives a time of 10hrs of battery per charge includes pubg usage upto 2hrs )2) the UI ( personally I liked it )3) smoothly handles the multi-tasking4) good for gaming (pubg runs without lag even in HDR mood)5) camera is good in day light6) can uninstall pre-installed apps7)usable storage was 108gb out of 128gb8) power saving mode is just awesome saves battery like hell.CONS:1) charging speed2) the other modes in camera both front and back are not that great in night3)face detection is not upto mark fails most of the time even in day light.Conclusion:Overall the phone is good with decent battery and camera and good for multitasking can disappoint a bit for high gamers

  Thanks for the Samsung( really I'm in song with it) for an all in one mobile set at an effective price. Till date,I am not a big fan of Samsung, as they produced mobiles at a bit expensive rate in comparison to other companies producing the same features at a lower price, but with this product, they completely got above everyone. Have been using it from past 3 days, the mobile amazed me with its battery backup, the camera was too good. While watching videos, it was a colorful and bright experience. I haven't experienced any pause while using applications till now. The finger print sensor is very fast in response. Over all to sum it up, it was a pretty good buy at this price. I suggest fellow buyers to go with 128gb rather than 64gb, as you are getting it, just for an extra 1000.

  Samsung Mobile Company is the best Mobile Company Because I buy Samsung Mobile.Model No M31. This mobile is Samsung Galaxy M31. It is very best product when I bought this mobile that time many people bought this phone.This is very good brand excellent camera result. Multiple functions to give photo different effects. Good Battery 6,000mAh battery and 15W Fast Charging timing. Interesting thing mobile not get held even we store multiple apps. Its rate is very economical every person easily affords it.Samsung Galaxy M31 Mobile is versatile 64MP Quad camera to document your life and Immersive viewing with 16.21cm (6.4"") Infinity-U Display with 64MP Ultra-High Resolution ISOCELL Bright GW1 image sensor. This is Excellent Feature With Fast Face Unlock and a Finger Print Sensor Now unlock your phone instantly with your face or fingerprint.Good storage capacity. In these mobile features is 6GB Ram so this phone never be hang in any time and in this mobile Internal Storage is 62GB and add in memory.So in my review I'm all the way supporting mobile and their functions and programs and the interesting thing is that is now a day’s mobile or cell phones or water protected in situation of wet or emergency by nature, however cell phone is very useful and super important for each and everyone, through cell phone you can call or message anyone within seconds, so I hope and I wish that in future I'll receive and see later the new innovations.Battery: Battery life is its biggest strength.1. Solid battery life2. Vivid display and One UI is goodCamera: Images from the primary camera display excellent exposure, dynamic range, and color in most lighting conditions, with very few visible artifacts affecting image quality.

"

  Overall everything  is good at this cost and best phone under 20k.Pros: very good battery life, camera quality, performance,  no issue of heating of phone.Cons:1. Signal reception quality is little less but good. Observed, less speed of data when compared with my other phone with same service provider(jio), in parallel sessions.2. Many well known feature like parallel space for all apps, scheduled reboot, IR  buster is not available.3. Battery charging with provided charger takes almost 4 hours to charge completly, I expected max 1 hour.4. New cool features which I really like.

  Pros--1. SUPER AMOLED DISPLAY  Yes the main purpose to purchase this phone is the display experience if u love to watch YouTube, Movies, Songs, etc. don't think just go for it. The sAMOLED display quality feels you premium which cannot provide by other brands in this price range. Samsung sAMOLED  is excellent compare to other brands sAMOLED.(I.e. realme, etc.)2. 64MP QUAD CAMERA, 32MP FRONT  CAMERA  Camera quality is awesome. It is improved compare to M30s 48mp triple rear, 16mp front camera and gives u more details while clicking pics. But when taking low light photos it performs average, sometimes details are missing and gives u blur photos.Note: Price is 15k not expect too much because other brands also lack in low light photos in this price range.3. 6000mah BATTERY  Battery backup is pretty good because sAMOLED display consumes less battery compare to (IPS)LCD, TFT display. It gives u 1.5 days battery backup which cannot given by 4000mah, 5000mah.4. ONE UI, 6GB RAM  Samsung one ui gives u time to time updates at least 2 yrs and above. It feels u cool compare to miui, realme mi etc. 6gb ram in this price range is just awesome because samsung A series will not provide this in 15k.Cons--1. EXYNOS 9611 OCTA CORE PROCESSOR  Samsung M30s is also come with this processor. Samsung should also upgrade the processor and give at least Qualcomm sd675 or above this time. Exynos 9611 is gud for daily purpose but if u are heavy gamer then it feels u bad. This processor is now outdated this time. Performance of exynos 9611 is similar to sd660 and sd665 which is below than sd675.2. MISSING NFC, SAMSUNG PAY, KNOX  SECURITY  A series provide these features but M series will not which is very disappointed for samsung user. Knox Security is samsung selfmade manufactured feature that's why it should also come in M series.3. BUILD QUALITY  Back side build quality is just plastic so u have to use gud back cover to avoid scratches and any other harm. A series Build quality feels u premium that's why M series are cheaper compare to A series.4. 15 WATT CHARGER  It has massive battery 6000mah but 15 w charger is not sufficient, it takes 2.45hrs to charge the phone 0 to 100%.Samsung should upgrade this and can give atleast 27watt charger this time.Note-1.Samsung always try to save money and this time they also achieve this by these all 4 cons. But in my opinion it is best package in 15k because A series are very expensive if we purchasing for these features.2. If compare to other Chinese brands samsung phones are durable for long term uses and provide many service centers everywhere to resolve issues.

  I bought the phone for the sole purpose of processing power and camera. Processing power is really great and so does the 6000mAh battery. But camera is really disappointing. You expect 64MP AI camera to match the standards but it performs really poor, even worse than my Samsung galaxy A70(2018) with 32MP camera. They should look more closely in building cameras. Phone has lag for some of the heavy apps but it eventually nullify soon you start using it daily. I would say if you are buying this phone for camera then DON'T please

"
"

  It is the best phone in this range. I really got what I wanted in this price range. Camera is far better than any other phone in this range. Specially the 64mp back and 32mp back camera. There are lots of features in camera like slow mo, night mode, super slow mo and many more. Fingerprint is working very nicely. I searched many other phones in this range, I watched many videos and review on different platforms and I found that no other phone is better than this. Performance is also really. Battery(6000mh) is awesome. I charge my this phone only once in whole day. There are so many features in this phone. I like the dark mode of this phone very much. Display is also amazing. This phone is perfect for any work. It is very easy to use its features. Overall this is beast phone in this price range. If you have more money you can go for Samsung A51 also.

  Before buying you must know the difference between 7k mobile and 10k to 15K Mobiles .Reason for choosing this title earlier i used a pro version model , Now i am reviewing this model after 3 days of usage.1. Ear speaker quality in outdoor's very poor  . Keep your headphones handy ,2.Sensor's are not working properly ( this is the reason i choose this title , sensor quality is based on price )3.App search option is not available  , you must be very patient to search required app when you have an urgent need , you have to swipe all your mobile to choose required app . or change the launcher . default launcher is not capable of doing this basic function .Rest all other functions are good  .

"
"

   Worst phone ever. Don't buy ths phone.heating issue at the bottom side of touch screen, touch button as well as ghost touch activates on its own within 1-2 minutes and you can not use any of the app properly.Initially thought it may be a due to some kind of virus, even after company reset issue is there and also you can see screen flickering very easily.

  This is my 4th MI Phone in 3 years. Earlier ones were good.But here The extra battery has made phone heavier and hence has lost it charm, now looks like chinese phone. Earlier ones were as good as other phone apart from brand.Not recommended.Would love to return but it was gift for family,

"

  I bought this for an older relative who needed a basic smartphone. Given its pricepoint I didn't have much expectations for the Redmi 8A but after unboxing and setting it up I have to admit - it looks and behaves like a premium phone!In almost every aspect 8A has been upgraded over the 7A. While it doesn't have a fingerprint sensor, the camera is much better than I expected. There is a bit of lag in opening and switching between multiple applications but it shouldn't be a big deal for people with basic usage patterns. To facilitate better grip, 8A has a non-glassy back that is textured. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by the phone given its pricepoint. For its target demographic (light users who might just want to take some pics, use social media and the occasional app) this is a great phone.The only drawback I felt is that Xiaomi has been aggressive in bundling custom apps in the phone that deliver lots of ads and sponsored videos by default (and it requires some know-how to disable them).

  Mobile is good at this priceBut when I was using hotspot and screen recording the mobile became overheated it hanged so i switch off it.In this range mobile is really good..

  We are highly unsatisfied with the product .There is performance issue with the phone in which the touch ,speed as well as the processor is very slow.It does not worth the money and the sound quality is also low.The battery also gets drained very early though it is of 5000 mAH.We have mailed a return request but they have not taken any action.I need to return this phone and want a new phone as soon as possible.

  Top smartphone in this priceEXCELLENCE camera , great display

"

  I purchased this phone in Feb. 2020  from Amazon site and now it's May 2020 and  I find it difficult to swipe it open after the display goes on sleep mode.  So this is the status it's touch mechanism within 3 months.  So one has to be careful about buying cheap quality Redmi phones as the touch mechanism may not be of good quality..

"

  Nice design,heavy, gr8 display size , camera quality poor, battery capacity excellentGood price for these features

"
"

  Phone is good, no finger print reader, but price is disappointingBecause it is launched at a price of 6499 now see the price

"
"

  The phone has many pros and some cons.The cons are :Speaker sound is not that good.Sound with bluetooth headphone ,earphone is not good.Equalizer can not be used in case of bluetooth headsets, earphones.There should be a 4 ,64 gb variant.There are some MI apps which can not be uninstalled.Camera is ok, medium quality.

   From 12 the day it is not working. Mi service center re installed the software but still it is not working

  Redmi 8A Dual (Sea Blue, 3GB RAM)Battery: The smartphone comes with a 5000 mAH battery. For an average user, this is great.OS: The preinstalled OS Android 9 with MIUI Global 11.0.2. user interface.OS Volume Bug: There is a bug which constantly causes volume to drop to zero. You can fix this bug by System Update.Camera: Pretty decent camera. There are already too many reviews on this, so I'm not gonna comment.Bloatware: Probably, this is what bugs me most in android devices. There are bunch of preinstalled apps and games. Most of them are unnecessary for you. You can remove most of them but not all. This is pathetic.RAM Usage: After removing bloatwares, the system takes around 1.1 GB of RAM, so you will have 1.9 GB of RAM which is enough for the most users.No Heating Issue: I'm not a gamer, but if you are an average you will not find any heating issue, at least most of the time.

  I was purchased Redmi 8A on.  19/02/2020,  but received phone is defective,  i was already registered my complain, but Amazon not postive response.

"

  I wasted my money on this phone,Phone hang a lot and all functions start working automatically and iam not able to restart the phone. So at that time I have to wait for 20 30mints.I demand product replacement or refund plz.

  I was a little sceptical while purchasing this phone as it was my first Chinese phone as I was fed up with my mom's rough phone usage! She successfully killed many good brand phones like HTC, Samsung etc so wanted something really cheap this time. I paid 7500 for this phone even though the old price was 6500! Due to lockdown, I had no option to roam around! The best part was I got 3100Rs for old Samsung J4 in exchange with no mess, whereas local shopkeepers were talking about 1k resale value lol! That was less than year old phone though but still, I was happy with buyback price so went ahead and decided to buy this phone even though there are plenty of negative reviews!Now coming to the phone I didn't feel like I'm holding some entry-level Chinese phone! It's a great phone for ladies who use phone just for WhatsApp and calling. No problems found so far. The battery is excellent. Colour is catchy. The best part is Type C slot as all other phones in my home have Type C! Best phone for basic users. Not for Pro. I own LG G7, Oneplus etc so I know what premium means! So I won't call it premium but it's definitely worth a try! Consider the life of a couple of years and proceed as even branded entry-level phones die sooner or later. It's been only 2 days so can't say much about it. If there seems to be any problem I'll update my review.

"
"

  Pros:*Cool battery*Type c charger and fast charging*Corning Gorilla glass 5(toughness)*Splashproof*Wireless FMCons:*Too many pre-installed unwanted apps which would kill internal storage and ram space*No private safe, but covered with second space. (Hide option is provided for folder as a whole, not for individual file/image. That too without password protection!! Too bad*processor performance is not great but good.*presence of Finger print sensor would be great*Both the cameras are too bad.. would feel like having 5 mp camera.*Weights heavy due to 5k battery

  I bought this phone for my dad.Pros:good battery lifelarge screenlook and feel is nicecamera is good for its priceCons:THIS HANDSET IS MADE IN CHINAI thought it is Redmi (made in India), but it is made by Xiomi.Does not have fingerprint scanner.

"
"

  It is fantastic phone for you if you are a normal user and not  a gamer . But unfortunately I received the handset is defective (I dont know that other have faced it or not) . In some app like BHIM UPI it shows the device is rooted. You can not oparate may app in rooted device . So please make sure that if your device same problem . If yes then mark my review as helpful. Thak me latter.

"

  Service is good but........

"
"

  Cons:1. Very bad camera. Selfie camera is not even enough for video calling.2. Performance is not up to mark with 3gb RAM.3. Heating problem with extensive usage of internet or gaming.4. Many unnecessary apps which cannot be removed are impacting performance.Pros:1. Very good battery life.2. Nice display and well built.3. Budget phone.Overall, it is a budget smartphone with less smartness. Lot of notifications which are unable to remove with many unnecessary apps in OS.

"
"

  Cons: No fingerprint sensor.No Widevine L1 support.Not a good camera at all. Photos captured are blurry and unclear. Totally disappointed with the camera.Too many MI built in apps which reduces the usable memory in hand.Pros: Premium quality design.Feels good in hand.Corning Gorilla Glass 5.Type C port.Fast charging.Dedicated Memory Card slot expandable upto 512 GB.Super Class Audio Speakers. Sound is very good. Listening music is very much enjoyable.Not heating up while charging.Display not bad at all.All in all a good phone at this price range.

"
"

  I have purchased 8A dual but its not a good product ,i have buy many product from amazon but i havent recevied such a bab product these phone camera is not good & get blink any while opening app..& phone get swtich off..while video call camera is not stable i request you to change the product & refund the money asap...i m not happy with this product..these issue i m facing from 1 month..

"
"

  When I receive this item it was 63% charge then I put charge after two hours it get only 68% only then I put whole night charge next day morning it get only 80% charge.. I totally disappointed..After that I returned this item then I received new mobile when I opened I directly put into charge, I get the same issue I don't what a do.. what they are doing I don't know they not checks properly and not inspected.. I really upset this service..

"
"

  In this price segment this is the worst mobile I have used yet. Camera is above average not best, there is a big issue in this phone is network and wifi connection issue.Phone automatically disconnected wifi connection all the time and network is also very weak comparing to other mobiles. One big issue I found today that touch is working automatically. And there is another problem with Amazon to replace the phone that now I have to post the phone to Amazon then they will send a new phone.Third class performance

"
"

  First  of  all I would like to say,""IT IS THE BEST PHONE UNDER ₹10,000""....*GOOD Selfie and Rear cameras at this price.*FAST CHARGING*GOOD PERFORMANCE*STYLISH EXTERNAL DESIGNS*BEST SPEAKERS*BEST FOR PLAYING GAMES LIKE FREEFIRE ,PUBG etc...(but You should play with Standard Graphics otherwise occurs a heating issue )*NO FINGERPRINT FACILITY*NO EARPHONES AVAILABLE WITH THE PHONE*PREVENT THE DEVICE FROM RUNNING IN LOW SPACE other wise There will be a Lag iSsue..

"
"

  First off all it is a good product for this price. Good looking and smooth. But..The camera is too cheap that it is a waste having dual camera for this quality. May be it's software issue.And IT LACK A FINGER PRINT SENSORbut HAVE FACE UNLOCK INSTEAD,it is pretty good.The phone is LITTLE BIT BULKY may be because of 5000mAh battery pack.Anyway it's is good as a budget phone

"
"

  The phone comes with a 6.22-inch touchscreen display with a resolution of 720x1520 pixels and an aspect ratio of 19:9. The Redmi 8A Dual runs Android 9.0 and is powered by a 5000mAh battery.The phone is a bit heavier though compare to the other ones. And sometimes it gets over heated.Overall, it's an affordable phone with a very reasonable amount of money.

"
"

  Defective product received as with many other users. The phone has ghost touch problem. This seems to be the issue with this phone model and also in general with Redmi phones as is apparent from several online forums. Since I only noticed this problem after the return period was over, Amazon wasn't ready to extend any support on this. The problem has only aggravated since and the phone now dials numbers  or opens apps on its own. For the first time in my life, I have faced a hardware issue with a brand new phone. Redmi QC seems to be very lax. Now I need to take it to the service centre. It is really annoying to send a new product for servicing and be left without a phone after spending your hard earned money.

"
"

  Excellent mobile to use... Bought for my father and he loved it as he starts to use it.Big battery lasts longer.Excellent display, vibrant colours presentation, nice photos and videos, up to the mark... Thanks Amazon for perfect package and delivery on time.From company side in the box, No screen guard and no mobile pouch provided.

  • Camera Quality is acceptable (Don't expect much quality).• Not a gaming processor. (Snapdragon 439)• No fingerprint reader.• Face Unlock is present.• Out of the box type-c charger is present.• Correct fit in hand.• Gives a good inhand feel.• We can play some heavy games in it (PUBG is included).• Excellent Display.• Dual 4G support is there.• 2.5 hours charging time (20% to 100%).

  The mobile phone is best option for those user that needs good battery backup. Beautiful looking mobile. Type C charging port but charger supplied with this mobile is 2 mAh type C Charger.

  It's working fineBest phone in this rangeLooking for I was looking for a phone under 8000 for my younger brother as he was having very tight budget so I search many phone went to market in the market offline this phone was being sold about 8500 but I got on Amazon in 7500 only you can see it is available on Flipkart another platform over 8000Other alternative of his phone in the same range having low quality processor and no gorilla glass screen c type charging in this range you cannot find anywherePhone has premium looks

  1. Battery Life is Good - Lasted for 1.5 days on one charge2. Full Charge took 1 Hour which is ok for 5000 MAH Battery3. Mobile is a little heavier due to battery4. The phone did not heat up though used continuouslyGood Buy at the offered priceImprovement Areas1. AI Camera is not that fast2. Already MI Security Patch is released and takes 1.7 GB of data for update, No problem for wifi users but heavy on cellular networks3. Lot of adds and push notifications, Disable them4. Camera Quality fair enough for this Price, Dont expect super trendy clarity5. Always notifies to update the built in apps all the time, they will work though not updated.

  Great phone and you will get all the high end phone trending (gestures, raise to wake, dark mode and much more) customizations with miui11.People who are not willing to spend a fortune on the devices can easily upgrade to this one.For daily usage beats all categories.Love it.

  My mom’s been using this for around a month now. It looks great, and found no issues yet.Tbh, display is too big. If you like big screen phones then go for it. Go for the 3GB RAM version, since 2GB one is too slow.Display: 5/5 (No issues at all)Sound: 3.5/5 (It’s loud but not that great)Camera: 3.5/5 (Dual cameras but photos are not at good)Battery: 5/5 (My mom doesn’t use it that much, so battery lasts up to 3-4 days easily)Quality: 5/5 (It’s plastic but the built is nice)Overall: 4/5 (Works out great for my mom at this price. Satisfied)

  Bought this for my father who is 75 years old, suggested by my son who is 15 years old. Both of them are impressed for different reasons. Father, for the light weight and non-slippery hold, son, for the speed, camera quality and sturdiness. I am happy because it is value for money. Overall, a great deal for first time users.

"
"

  This is one of the cheap smartphone according to its features.Battery capacity is amazingCamera is ok not so good.Two things I dislike about this Phone that it is made in China not only mobile, adapter is also made in China and the second thing is 10w charger is given in this box we have to purchase separately.Sound quality is clear and too lound I liked this also.Overall I like this Phone.Note: We have to use invoice as a warrenty card to claim our warrentybecause Warrenty Card is not separately given inside the box. So I request the seller to give invoice in good condition to customers because I have not received invoice in good condition.  (For those customers who have written ""Warrenty Card is not given"" in their review and for the seller).Hope this will help.Thank you.

  I purchased Redmi 8A Dual on 27th July 2020. It has 7 days return policy. After 15 days the phone was switched off automatically and after several trying phone did not power on. I go to the redmi authorized service center for servicing of the mobile phone. They tell me that the phone was water damaged. Due to this I did not get any warranty. But they did not open the mobile in front of me for checking.  Worst quality of phone I ever seen and worst quality of service center they have.

"
"

  Not a good product. Took it to service center. First they changed software. But again started to hang. Requested for replacement, but not getting replacement during warranty. I purchased this because of its high rating and it looks amazon rating is fake.

"
"

  I ordered this phone on behalf of a relative and she confirmed tht the battery last only 2-3 hours.When she went to MI service centre, they said tht they cannot replace the phone because it is bought on Amazon and Amazon should replace it. Some nonsense.They have finally agreed to replace the battery.please be careful buying Mi Phones.

"
"

  I bought it on 13 jul 20 and from last 10 days I am having a huge problem like battery is getting down very fast, phone is getting hanged again and again. When sometime someone is calling me my phone screen is getting totally black. Messages are sometimes been shown in dragbox but when I am touching it or finding it in inbox it is invisible. I am totally hopeless that what I have bought. Total waste of money.

  A good dual camera phone in this price range. Battery is 5,000 mah, but performs like 4,000 mah. Camera is good. The best thing is its screen. A nice 6.2"" inch display. Similar to most high value mobiles from this same brand. This sky white colour is best among three. A perfect budget phone till date.

"
"

  Posting reviews after using it for 1 month:Cheap quality intarnal materials used ex. Camera sensor, bluetooth, etc.Realized after experiencing following unexpected problems:- screen hanging- bluetooth not connecting now, earlier connecting when it was- leaves the marks/shadow of the icons/screen elements used in previous applications or even after accessing the contacts or any content.- mobile charger gets heated up like anything after 5-10 min of chargingQuality getting cheaper as the number of users increasing. Company only eye on maximizing the profits. That's what the conclusion is.

"
"

  Exactly once 10 days over for replacement 11 th day phone display goes off. Went to service centre asked for replacement they said nit possible done change of display of some other model and given much dissatisfied from this purchase.

"

  I think mobile delivered to me today is defective and not in working condition.So it is surprised like a reputed E_Com , Amazon India doing this type of delivery.it hampers your name and fame.please file a case or written compaint to your seller.

  Redmi 8A Dual 3gb 32gb..Mobile average performance..Not available Fingerprint Reader..Battery life performance also average 5000Mah Battery not going full 2 day with normal usage..Camera quality is also average not upto mark..No slow motion video.. not more option..And main thing so many adds on apps unnecessary  getting notifications...Totaly average performance..But good thing is this mobile getting USB TYPE C & Fast Charging Support is available...

  I had this Smartphone for my mother. Now after using it about 15 days , I can assure you that Xiaomi has arranged a great deal , but by the time passes new Smartphones will be it's competitors. So remember it's time and current scenario I can completely recommend you to buy this phone if your budget is below 10k .I had ordered 3gb+32gb sea blue variant and got delivered within 5 days , thanks to Amazon. The phone supports 18 watt fast charging and has 5000 mah battery and face unlock , which are unexpected in this price range. But Snapdragon 439 processor is not eligible to do any hard work . I would recommend to use this phone for basics.

  Important tip: Buy 3GB version to run free fire and other apps without any lags (Available Ram 2 GB/3GB).●Mobile is very good without any lags till now. (using Messenger, Whatsapp, gaana app simultaneously).●Don't buy this mobile for playing high config games. Processsor and graphics hardware are of average quality.●The battery is huge in this mobile. Charging with realme 20W charger took around 2 hours (10% to 95%).●The front and back camera is good in this price segment, and don't expect a quality like 15k mobiles.●The screen comes with a corning gorila 5, with no extra thin screen protector which other phones has.●Face unlock is good but sometimes doesn't work in low light. That is completely ok in 8k mobile.●Now the main thing which I don't like on this phone is useless apps which can't be uninstall. (like MiPay, MI secure vault, etc MI apps). And we can't trust these apps as government banned many MI apps because Xiomi read  and store every activity you do with those apps. So only use google apps to secure data and personal details. BTW it is still not reliable because MI11 OS also can read all your data. Some MI apps has own T&Cs which no one reads before opening. So use Xiomi phones carefully and don't store any banks information or passwords.

  It's not called grey colour... If there is no stock of the required colour,it should be shown to the customer... Should not just give any colour you have.That's the problem,but this colour too is not bad.

  I have upgraded from 7a to 8a, this series was released just three months after the earlier version.The battery🔋 which is 5000mah doesn't seem to be showing lot of difference from the 4000mah on the previous 7a. The only negative being the weight of the phone is a little heavier than the previous one. The blue color looks great but the phone is not easy to hold, you have to add back cover with a grip.Camera is good but the front camera has a lot of AI in it. When I took a picture with the back and front camera, the front looked too bright with a lot of brightness.Call quality is very good and it sounds almost like Nokia quality. Videos look good.  I have dropped my old phone a few times with absolutely no damage to body or phone function. I don't use the face lock so can't comment

"
"

  The phone does not boot up. I am not sure what quality check has gone into the product. unfortunately I was not able to return the product on time and the return window got lapsed. Now I am running at the MI brand store to get the product replaced. I spoke with amazon customer care and the seller and they were not willing to replace the product as it got out of the window. What good is a phone if it does not even boot up, What quality testing was done on the phone. Worst exp with amazon and with the seller. I was asking them for replacement as I could not ope n the product on time due to medical issues.

Network seems okay so far!I still wonder why don't we get an EDGE to EDGE DISPLAY  & why REDMI LOGO had to be down there. Besides why did they had to come out with shady hue (Sky White, Midnight Grey & Sea Blue) versions, & why not just simple sleek 'Black or White' . They could have been more simple though, i don't seem if the design at the rear does any wonders or is  wow factor..Thanks to Amazon!

  The phone is good for the average user. I can say the one who needs streaming apps, whatsApp, Facebook and similar other app will love the phone. Everything is as per expectation. Would have surely liked the product if it was made in India. The model I received is Made in China. Battey backup is good. I am not into much of camera but it comes with 13MP which is good from business point of view.Face recognition is working 7/10 times. No fingerprint scensor. But it's okay for few people like us. Storage is more than enough with 53GB. And 3 GB RAM works well with all apps I mentioned.

"
"

  Defective product. Started auto shutoff and on after just completion of return date. I have purchased it on 12th July 2020. Problem started from 25th July and surprisingly 24th July was last date to return. Very much disappointed. I am purchasing so many products from Amazon. They should check thoroughly before delivering at the cost of their reputation.

"
"

  This is the third Xiaomi product I'm purchasing but this time I'm highly disappointed. 8A phone is no different than Redmi 7A except that this is quite bulky to hold and has better battery life and comes with a C-type charger. Redmi 7A is a lot better than 8A in terms of design. Don't go for the Blue coloured one of 8A, cos it has a funny shade than what's seen in the pictures. Camera claims to have 13mp lens but has no quality of even an 8mp Samsung phone. Also has poor settings with so much beautifying filter which makes everything look so lighter in shade, polished and cartoon like. Xiaomi used to deliver top notch quality phones and camera at the same price range when they launched phones during 2015-16 time period. Xiaomi is compromising a lot on camera quality. The touch response of the handset i received is slow. Also they're refusing to return the product and instead they're giving me a replacement of the same phone which I don't want. When we contacted the Amazon customer care they're asking us to place the return after accepting the second replacement. Why this complication when you can return the first right away than make everyone take double risk of travel in this time of pandemic.

  I take online classes so video and voice must be clear. The mobile should be slim and light weight to put on tripod.  I needed a rough and tough high performance phone within my budget constraints.C type charging pin means long pin life. Battery backup is superb, Speaker sound is quite loud, slim body and vibrant colours look smart. Camera is more than enough to fulfill my need as an amateur photographer.Display and handling is quite good. Normal apps work smoothly and I don't use phone for gaming. WhatsApp, Facebook, youtube, etc work well and 64GB Storage with 3GB RAM is more than enough for me.

"
"

  Pros:1.Great Battery Backup.2. The display quality is good.3. The processor is powerful enough for daily tasks not for gaming.4. The only phone with Type-C charging port under 10k, supports fast charging.Cons:1. No fingerprint reader.2. Pre-installed Bloatware.3. Normal charger instead of a fast charger.4. Average camera: Good in daylight(Use Gcam for best results).Overall a decent phone for a college student, Family members.

  It's a great phone in low budget. If you are looking a low budget phone then you will go for it. It will provide you fully satisfaction.ProsBattery life is awesome.Build quality is good.Display is also very good in this price range.ConsIt does not have finger lock sencer.Face lock is slow but ok in this price range.Back cover in unavilable in the box.If you find my review helpful then like it guys

  Its average phone and disappointed with Amazon as they havent mentioned country of origin as China

  Writing this review after using this device for 2 months.Delivery was super fast (Delivered in just 2 days)..Pros :-1. Big Display (This 6'22"" display is really good for day to day usage).2. Battery & Charging - 5000 mAH battery lasts upto 2 to 2½ days for a normal usage and this supports 18w fast charger and also have USB Type-C cable which is excellent in this price range.3. Look & Feel - This entry level smartphone have a polycarbonate back which is decent and have a good grip..., And it also have Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protection in the front.4. Face Unlock feature - This smartphone doesn't have fingerprint sensor but have a face Unlock which is quite reliable and works well..Cons :-1. Processor - They should have gone for Snapdragon 450 or 460, SD439 is old processor.2.  Bloatwares - There are adds in this device & also have few bloatwares like Mi Community & Helo App which are banned by Indian Government..Overall this is a good upgrade from Redmi 7A at this price range..If you want an entry level smartphone this one is good.

"
"

  This is a great product under the 10k range..personally loved it.Though it doesn't have finger print sensor its beautifully designed and can be used.. i've bought this for my father n he loves it.. battery life is 5000mah which is huge and camera quality is good for this range. . so you can definitely give a try

"
"

  The phone is beautifully designed, including the patterned plastic back and the dewdrop notch design. the battery life is good but it could be better but since it's miui,there isn't much you can get apart from ads in the UI which are hard to turn off,there's a lot of invasive bloatware and adware,also the camera quality is average,there was no need for a dual cam setup(I feel the lower camera can be fake),the front cam is average too,I think should've gone with the 9i. Also, there's no screen protector or cover in box

"
"

   Bought  a new redmi dual 8A through Amazon .There is a technical issue with this handset.its functioning on it's own .various screen and key pad functions start functioning without even touching the handset.Amazon is not willing  to replace the handset. What a waste of money

"
"

  I have got a defective product today I pluged earphone but it didn't work than I thought the ear phone is faulty I tried new one but this didn't work too. Then I tried both earphone on another phone these were working.And returning period is also over but the good thing is I rarely use earphone but when I tried earphone today first time and found the product is faulty I have got a lot of anger but it was my mistake too that I didn't check it in starting days.Ya, but it worthy to be criticized.Instead of this sometimes it's touch do not respond instantly, I have got this problem later.

"
"

  Everything is good in mobile but processor is little bit slow(if u r a game user not recommended). Also if u use many applications simultaneously then mobile will go slow.Some how I disappointed that chinese applications is still in there by default and you can't uninstall them,such as mi browser,mi music, mi pay, cleanmaster, mi video, xiaomi wheather etc. Chinese applications is banned in india and company xiaomi india also remove all these Chinese applications.Overall recommended if u r not a heavy user battery backup is good and type-c charger  which support 18watt fast charging is the only pros of this mobile.

"
"

  Fingerprint sensor is not available, face unlock feature is available, value for money phone for this price range , I exchanged with my old HTC device ,it costs me around 6299 Rs for 2GB variant , built quality is good, feels solid in hand , sky white colour looks pretty decent and beautiful in hand, cannot expect a good gaming  performance from this device, tried playing Pubg lite & Free fire, not suitable for gamming. Best part is battery back up & USB Type C charging port with fast charging options available. Not satisfied with the face unlock feature. Can be considered as a good option for secondary handset, overall a value for money product.

  Product is working slowly. Keyboard not working properly. Was trying to return the product, showing is not eligible. Product was delivered on 4th March. Within a month all these issues are coming up. Feeling really bad.

"
"

  I have read the reviews before buying the mobile. So thought to give it a luck. After using for 1 day the mobile screen keep on touching itself from any part of the screen. The phone hangs a lot. Pubg runs good at times but a lot of time it lags. I checked the battery performance in setting, the screen itself consuming more than 94% of battery which makes battery drain rapidly. I have replaced it. Now got a replacement with tampered mobile box. However the packing was not tempered. To my surprise it is a used mobile. Fingerprint of former user was found on mobile screen and charger. The mi seal was broken and re-pasted and delivered to me. The seller think himself oversmart. Keep distributing used mobile to the customers. I have checked this mobile condition which is good at outside but the internet connectivity is very poor it does not go beyond 350kb at 2am midnight Jio 4G. Which goes beyond 2Mbps at this time in other mobile phone. Also charger is heated up when charging within 20 minutes and it's not 18W power charger. So i got a defective used product in replacement.  Now i  want my refund. I am not satisfied with this mobile. The conclusion is that if you are lucky enough than this mobile will work for a few day until replacement period is over or maximum 15 days later you will repent at your choice. Better put 1-2k more and get better mobile than this Redmi 8A Dual 3-32.

  The Budget BeastNo words to describe the new Redmi 8A especially its stunning look ... amazing display with water drop notch looks premium. This design is seen only in 15 k segment from Samsung where Xiaomi did it.Awesome cameraI have used 4A & 7A but comes to 8A its totally changed in camera. Its AI powered camera gives excellent output even in low light conditions  worth it...oooohIncredible Battery but not hulky5000 mAh class leading battery gives approximate two days of normal use without charging twice. Not much bulky in hand and weight is optimized!!!!! wowperformance is out of the worldGames, movies, chatting, shooting no compromise on multitasking Smoothly run by octa core chipset from Snapdragon 439 is excellent at this price point is amazing....octa core at 6K OMG....main disadvantage I have noticed is there is no notification led...

  Battery is okCamera is goodBut missing warranty cardWhy cheated like this fruaders

"
"

  Ok phone. Brought as I got good exchange price of my old phone against purchase of redmi 8a dual. Speed ok. Phone hangs sometimes. Camera ok. Call quality and battery life superb. Display very good for budget phone. One defect. IR blaster is not working on my redmi 8a dual since day one. One irritating this that MI asks permission to store data and track for almost everything we use on this phone. Would rate it ok purchase as I got for only 3000 in exchange of my old phone.

"
"

  Simple smartphone, but Good Smartphone! Camera average but included PRO mode, Battery backup excellent Charged 4 days ago. Used normal internet and Dual 4G native video calling and WiFi Hotspot without gaming till now. Display 6'22"" good, No lag, Good face detection. Overall 9/10 but if you consider the price then it's 10/10 actually.

"
"

  Battery life is good but as it is not fast charging, it takes 3-4 hours to charge completely. It looks really good as well...and so far it's performance has been amazing. Camera is good as well. Overall it's an excellent phone in this price range.But do refer to it's YouTube review as well. All of its features and deficiencies are explained in detail there.

"
"

  In products detailed information it is mentioned, product would be made in India, but why delivered product is made in China. I know company is from China, however I thought product is getting manufactured in India. Please put correct information in product details.

"
"

  - utmost thing is battery backup- camera is too good at good light condition- low light camera is blurry- speakers are good at sound- there is double tap for screen wake- the VoWifi(Voice over WiFi) is available for selected operators- network reception is also good- phone is little bit heavy- it will good if here is LED notificationat last i would say the phone is best value phone from Xiaomi But there UI bugs are ridiculous

"
"

  Good mobile for the price you get. SD439 does the day to day job, definitely gaming is not amongst those. Camera is what you get for the price. The highlight is battery which is absolutely killer. Can easily give a screen on time of 10 plus hrs on mixed usage. Supports fast charging however only 10 watts charger is supplied in the box and,without any headphones which is understandable at this price.

"
"

  Good budget mobile for basic usage like attending online classes, listening to music, watching videos and normal browsing. The limited 2 GB RAM doesn't allow for multitasking and gaming which you obviously can't expect in a phone at this price. The features are really amazing like the p2i coating, Gorilla Glass 5 and wireless FM which makes this a strong and durable phone to have!

"
"

  Did lot of research before buying.At this budget this the best phone I found it in market. I am not big fan of redmi. But it is cost effective and good for short term use.Over all phone is okay don’t expect much .Sound quality is good.Battery life is also good.Have all the required basic features.Camera is not that great if you need good camera dont go for it.Phone is heating while charging.Go for it if it fit in your budget.Overall okay.

"

  Redmi 8a dual is the worst mobile in the market. The phone has serious lag issues and the home page freezes from time to time. I got a replacement after I complained about lag issues and the second piece turned out to be worst than the first. Now I am stuck with this ""brick"" of a mobile forever. After a complaint about the replacement, Amazon sent a service expert who was unaware of my phone's problem. He came, he saw, he yelled, he blabbered and left telling that the phone is fine according to him and that I have 365 days time to keep visiting the Mi service centre day after day.

"

  Hello guys,I am using this phone from 8th july. When i Bought it and start using it initially there was issues of automatic brightness of the display, it was getting stuck at particular level and in the bright light you need to manually increase the brightness. but after software update all those issues were resolve but now i am facing phone slow down issue very much. After this much time phone is got slower and slower. if you go to camera it just hung.very very bad ...experience .... earlier i was using note 4 of mi. which is still working very well ...And one should expect better performance from latest gadget .... which is totally missing....I shall not recommend to buy this product....Do not feel bad Mi.......  Please work on it..Thank you.

"
"

  It’s just not worth the money. I have used MI phones earlier and they work fine but this one is useless.1) it’s very slow and if you open multiple app at a time the phone will hang2) Even opening YouTube application on this phone takes close to 8-10 seconds3) Battery is very and will last appx 1 day with normal usage4) lot of ads pop up which is irritating5) Camera is very bad , My earlier MI 5A takes better pictures than this phoneOverall very unhappy with this product.I have been using this since 10 days now.

"
"

  I returned this the third day after delivery.It hanged in my very first use LOL !•Camera is below average.•Processes is average.•It does not have fingerprint reader.•• Hangs when you record video using Snapchat & WhatsApp. (third party apps)Honestly, Even in Rs.8999, you can get much much much much better experience!AND I'M NOT EXAGGERATING.

"
"

  There is one feature of this phone wherein we can tab three times on screen to see zoom view; when I enabled that, I found lagging issue with phone and also screen got freeze some times, with this option face diffuculty to dial a phone when we need to type like 9998 it's my own number series,Camera performance disappoint me; in day lite it's Ok, I can say average, and in night compete zero..""0"", and color capturing is also not good.I am happy with design, that gives rich look, touch is smooth, also allows to delete preinstalled games & other application.It's okay with this price and No cost EMI option.Thank you

"
"

  The phone got slow after one week use, i wanted to replace but the replace window is closed. Camera & battery are average, It's not like 13MP & 5000Mah. The device is not suitable to play any game even ludo, it's started lagging when you open ludo and after shut any from your app your home display become blank for few seconds ...........Worst experience.Dear Amazon team, please help to replace the device.

"
"

  Rear camera quality is below average, main problem is with auto focus, camera is struggling to focus on objects.Wireless display feature problem, wireless display is frequently disconnected with Smart TV.OS become unstable sometimes, need to reboot is the only option to recover the phone.Failed to upgarde on MIUI 11, after complete download of around 2 GB, it fails to update on MIUI 11.

"
"

  निश्चित रूप से रेडमी ने अपने आप को काम कीमत में बेहतर फीचर्स एवम् क्वालिटी मोबाइल कंपनी के रूप में स्थापित किया है परन्तु कॉम्पटीशन के चक्कर में रेड़मी ने सस्ते पार्ट्स इस्तेमाल करना शुरू कर दिया है। यही वजह है कि रेडमी के फोन्स की क्वालिटी घटती जा रही है। Redmi 8a में mike की घटिया क्वालिटी इसका एक नमूना है। मै redmi 8a के 5 से भी ज्यादा फोन में वही same mike problem देख चुका हूं। Vioce क्लियर नहीं आती । Feels like old days chinese mobile phone।प्लीज खरीदने से पहले एक बार किसी भी दूसरे के मोबाइल को इस्तेमाल करके देख लें । Totally disappointed this time

  Bought the phone for my wife when her phone screen was damaged. It was on offer on Amazon at the time and for its price, it seemed like a great deal. Note that the spec says 2GB ram, 32GB storage. Being a Samsung user, i wasn't sure how the experience would be. However i am happy to report that aside from a few hitches, this phone is excellent. The 2GB may seem less but i never noticed any issue when using fb or youtube. I cannot recommend it for intensive gaming but for casual use like watching videos etc, it is fine. I havent tested the selfie cam yet but the front cam is pretty good. There is no fingerprint sensor. Even though the phone supports fast charging, there is no fast charger provided. No earphones. Basically just the phone and regular charger. Ensure you remove the preinstalled bloatware and banned chinese software. Finally an excellent 5000 mAh battery that lasts almost a whole day on active use. All in all, a phone perfect for the casual user.

"
"

  Ordered it for my mother. Good phone for her but for average user it is not that good.Cons:Phone keep hanging if multitasking done like opening of 2 or more apps at same time.Battery life is also not so good.Built Quality and finishing is not good.Pros:SnapDragon processor at this range.Handy phone.

"
"

  Nice phone, as expected. Only negative side is that it belongs to a Chinese company and a part of our payment will reach the Chinese (though made in India).Only Sub 10K price range phone with snapdragon processor and 64GB phone memory.Phone don't have fingerprint unlock, but have face unlock.Battery lasts for 2 days for average normal use (calls, social media and youtube, without gaming)Camera also good, with decent portrait mode with background blur and all the gimmicks.All in all a good budeget phone.Still i am a little upset that i supported the Chinese (even though indirectly)

"
"

  First I ordered this mobile on 6th July and got it on 9th july(2020). There was 3.5 mm jack issue with this mobile and I ordered for it's return.Again I got a new mobile on 13th July but I can return my mobile till 20th July.On 22nd July I faced another issues with this new mobile. Apps opening and closing itself. Nither I can close my app nor I can switch off mobile. For example if I'm surfing fb then it suddenly get closed and suddenly open. Even mobile automatically start typing in comment box.So I just want to tell you pls don't go for this mobile.

  I purchased this product only cause my one plus was broke and I couldn’t get it repaired on time. I needed a spare phone for emergencies and I bought this product considering the cost factor. I’ve never used any of RedMi products and since RedMi claim that they are the products for cost I wanted to give it a try. As I expected, it’s the worst performance phone. I’m not talking about the performance equal to a premium smartphone. I’m talking about basic use. The touch is worse. It taps automatically and makes the usage of phone a nightmare. Have to restart it multiple times to fix that issue temporarily. U never know when the same error occurs. Other than that, major thing is “THE DEVICE TURNS OFF ALL OF SUDDEN FROM NOWHERE AND WONT TURN ON AT ANY COST”. Nobody knows why that happened and will have to factory reset the device from device factory mode. Will never buy any of the RedMi products just because of price. I’d rather get a good quality product even if I have to pay a little more money.I’d not recommend at all be it any product coming from this company.

  Lots of useless manufacturer and google apps. You open the box and it feels like you're using someone else's phone. Additionally, they cant be uninstalled. Hogs up 14 GB of 32 GB space and you're left with only 18 GBs. And if you're using two sims you cant even insert a memory card to store pics/music or whatever.Ads everywhere! You open any of their apps, even the system apps, and adds are there to greet you.Does not come with a fingerprint senser.Battery life is decent but lets see how it works 6 months from now.Has an ugly(imo) screen tint as default. And for some reason, every time I restart I have to set the tint and turn off auto-brightness all over again.  Idk if it's a fault or I am not doing it right.Screen guard and back cover not included in the box as is the norm with some other manufacturers.Comparing it with Honor 8c which I bought last year for roughly the same price (8.3k), this phone's resolution is massively inferior to Honor's even though they both claim it to be 720 x 1520 pixels.Very disappointed and underwhelmed with this purchase. Only keeping it because it was the cheapest phone (among newer releases) in the 32gb/3gb category on amazon. You save your money to buy an entry level phone and still it doesn't feel personalised. Fed up with these proprietary devices. Linux mobile distros cant come soon enough.

  Worst phone I have ever purchased...3 gb ram but lags a lot on full version kine master and other designing apps other. I have tried the trial on two mi 8 phones pic attached of both.. Samsung and Huawei phones with 3 gb are best it was my first mi phone and I m disappointed with this phone. I was using huawei and Samsung 3 gb ram varient and are best till date after more than 2 years of rugged usage. Even micromax 4311 3gb ram is faster than miI suggest to go for Samsung. mi is best for those who have not used Samsung and huawei(including honor) ram and battery management is best in Samsung, micromax and huawei

  Redmi 8a dual is a balanced phone in its price rangeAdvantages...1. Processor is SD2. Display3.build quality4. battery life5. Face unlock6. Type c charging fast chargingDisadvantages...1. Front and rear camera quality is not up to the mark. It is slightly below avg quality. I hope redmi can fix it by software update.2. Picture stabilization is not up to the mark.3. Sound quality should be given slightly better.4. I have big issue with interface miui. There are a lot of adds.5. Some deadly apps come with pre installed. Those garbages should be removed by software update.Overall if you are looking for a low budget phone for your parents usage purpose or child's study purpose, this is the right one battery is larger, processor is good for day to day life usage and display is much better. Face unlock is fast. But redmi should Remove the garbage apps. Overall 4.5 star for the phone below 8k.

   I dislike the phone because fingerprint reader so poor that after few times it start becomes blur and screen got shake automatically and poor camera quality. My money goes in vain totally rubbish product. Do not buy any chinese because two of my chinese phone working very worst. I am not lying please see the image and video I have uploaded.

"

  It's a little hard to use with one hand, and the keyboard doesn't seem to have one-handed mode, but the split screen feature and the screen brightness make up for that. This is the first smartphone I've used where the minimum brightness is satisfactory for use in a dark room. The dark mode and reading mode options are quite helpful, too. The screen is also resistant to damage, to a certain extent. The battery cannot be removed, but there seems to be a fair amount of ingress protection because of that. Lastly, it comes with its own USB-C charging cable, which is a little short but charges well enough.

  I have ordered this product on September 1 and got it on sep 3. After 3 days ,the display stops it's working. The image in these display are now show as multiple images and are floating most of the time. Not even able to read atleast a word properly.Some times it seems normal but most of the time they are not working. I have brought this for my siblings for attending online classes. But this product is absolutely useless. My all other phones are brought from Flipkart and other sites. But none of them are of this kind. All of them are working properly. I thought that the product from Amazon might be having better quality than other sites,but now I think that I was wrong. I lost believe in Amazon. I have contacted the customer service and they told that service exicutive will inspect the phone and then only they can proceed. But I think this is not fair because the executive will reach to my house after two days and after inspection they will decide what to do. I need refund for this item, I will brought product of another company from somewhere else. Or I will file a case in consumer court for this issue against MI and Amazon India for cheating me. I have discussed this with an advocate.

  It is a basic phone ... If you have money add 2k or 4k and opt for another model.( Phone supports manily  for children and elder parent )Redmi note 8 or pocco m2* Positives *Best at 7.5k* Excellet battery* Good display* Use for online class* Negative ** No finger print ( but at this price range exceptional )* Camera is biggest issue.. I have expected more from rear cam..* Little bit of hang at 2gb ram , go for 3 gb ram ...* Cannot use for hard, not a gaming phone..

  I bought this product with exchange, exchanged with old redmi 5. The pick up guy verified the mobile in and out and picked up from home. Surprisingly after one day he called and said glass is broken which we never noticed. And am sure it was not. We cant say what he did in 1 day with mobile. Now asking to return. It is not acceptable, i do not know wht all he did with mobile. If it was broken he could have rejected during pick up. This what i do not like..

"
"

  Phone is a good option in this range.It lacks fingerprint scanner. Camera quality is not so good. It is a very heavy phone,  difficult to keep itnin hands id you are using it for long while lying in bed. But it is worth buying.It has made in india sticker also,  not sure if it is real.

"
"

  At first glance I was happiest person to have bought this phone at Rs 7499  (2GB Ram, 32 GB internal memory). The joy was, however, short lived. The charger failed to work. Went for return option but customer executive suggested a test via Blancco App. Done. Thereafter, he assigned a technician to visit my place and inspect the phone. Alas, the technician didn't turn up nor did he respond to call. In the meantime, phone frequently began to hang and misbehave. As of now I am cursing my fate. It is worst ever phone i have come across. Don't waste your money. You will repent the decision to buy this phone. Please take my advice seriously. This Redmi 8A dual phone will turn your face red with anger...

  I have  purchased this mobile on 25 July and within seven days mobile Battery is draining very fast. I want to return this faulty mobile. But return window is closed .Amazon can help in this

"
"

  I've been using Xiaomis product from Its Note 4 launch and was satisfied by its performance as well as its manufacturing in India as all the box contains information that it is MADE IN INDIA but this was the 1st time i bought this phone and it doesnt have that MADE IN INDIA logo and it's clearly written over there on the phone that it's MADE IN CHINA😠 I've not expected this from #Redmi_India that they cannot afford a budget segment phones manufacturing in their own country 🤧🤕

"
"

  It has a problem. Of getting auto boot since day one.....recently it flashed with Android 10.....and since then it shuts down auto and it takes very firm press on the power button to boot.....and when u are doing this after every 2 hrs then quite a fun.....I will never buy MI product in my life......it was first n last time I did.....these cheap Chinese re-incarnation claiming to be made in India. .....I really don't believe with the quality it's packed with.....

"
"

  At the budget I didn't have any other choice. So bought this phone, totally a killer.Cons - signal reception not good and no fingerprint scanner.Pros - display and battery is awesome.I had issues with battery backup atfirst later on I turned off may things, which was automatically running in background. Now the battery is unbelievably good, mom is totally Happy with it.

"
"

  At this price range this is a good buy. The phone looks elegant and sleek.The camera is good outdoors in sunlight but in dark spaces it does not perform well. Again at this price it is worth it.The Ad ridden OS is a bit irritating but once the warranty is void one can install custom ROM.It is easy to handle and carry and the does not feel heavy even with the 5k battery.Did not face any overheating issues so far.I never play games so have nothing to comment on that front.Screen clarity is good and brightness in sunlight is also not an issue (I use dark mode)Overall a good buy but in a month or so you may get better models.

  I've used many phones in this budget segment from renowned brands. I was always skeptical about Redmi/Xiaomi. It was hard to make a decision of buying this phone. But to be honest, I'm totally moved! Be it the display, be it looks, usage, it is totally a power package. The amazing thing is, you're getting 5000 MAH battery in less than 8k ! Easily runs over 1.5 days with a full charge and average usage (multitasking, video streaming, browsing, social media). It also comes with 18W Fast Charging support. The display will blow your mind. Looks are quite good, could've been better. What is a drawback is it doesn't have a Fingerprint Sensor, which is a must for phones in this budget! Camera quality is ""just okay"".Lastly, I'm using this device for the last 4-5 days, didn't feel any lag though it comes with 2GB RAM, all credits to Redmi's amazing optimisation.You can go for it without a single doubt in your mind if your budget is right.

"
"

  Very bad experience, just after 20 days, it is not working properly. Many times while using this ohone, it automatically closes all the apps and returns to home screen and then it just hangs and then we have to restart it to make it work again.

"
"

  I am using 2gb/32gb variant(white). Using it since 16 days and have not found a problem yet... No hanging/lagging...i have downloaded games of 250-300 mb and played it... The result was fantastic and neither it hanged nor became hot while playing or charging... Speaker sound is pretty good and Camera quality is superb in good lighting conditions mainly during day time (outdoors), no one can say it's a 8k below phone by looking it's camera performance due to SD processor and battery backup is good too....Conclusion:- This phone is for people who are not game addict and those who love photography but are know in budget... The phone performance is lag free for day to day usage and most importantly uninstall or disable the preloaded apps if you don't use it.

  The modem of this phone is very slow. It gives only half the actual speed. My other phone gives a speed of 90mbps on wifi whereas this phone give only 40 mbps on same network. Getting less than 1 mbps on LTE networks. Camera is below average.

"
"

  Don't go for this phone unless your budget is very low.This phone doesn't have aby fingerprint scanner. Fast charger doesn't come in the box.Neither comes a back case or screen protector or headphone. You have to buy all those separately.Camera quality is also not good.My suggestion is to spend 1-2k extra and go for other good phones.

"
"

  I would like to start with prosPros:1. After unboxing, the first feel and look is awesome. The aura x grip design on the back of the device is superb considering its price range which gives a premium feel while you are holding the device in your hands.2. The big 6.22 inch ips lcd display of resolution 720x1520. The viewing angles are good and comes with support of sunlight display which mean in outdoors one will not have a problem viewing this device. Due to its large screen content consuming is very good and the dot notch in the top middle of the screen does not annoy while watching videos or playing games. The display also comes with gorilla glass 5 protection which is very rare in this price segment and protects your device to some extent from scratches and drops.3. This device comes with p2i nano coating which means it can save the device from splashes of water to a certain extent. But do not dip it in water as it is not water resistant.4. This device comes with snapdragon 439 processor which is based on 12nm process. This chipset can go up to 2ghz and performs day to day task and gaming easily. Pubg lite and pubg mobile runs smoothly on this device. Pubg lite can go up to a maximum resolution of balanced at very high frame rates whereas pung mobile can go upto balanced with medium frame rates. Both games run smoothly without any lag or stutter.5. This device is powered by a 5000mah battery which gives a backup of upto 2 dys on average usage. But for heavy gamers and content viewers this device gives backup of upto a day on single charge. This device comes with 10ww charge and if you charge with 10w charger it takes around 2hr 30min but if you charge it by 18w charger it takes around 2hr.6. The camera on the back is 13+2 mp AI dual camera. The ai scene detection is good and fast. The backgroung blur during portrait mode is very good and the selfie camera is 8mp ai camera. This also support portrait mode but the blur could have been better. Both camera support 1080p recording at 30fps.7. Comes with face unlock and is pretty fast with proper lighting condition.Cons:1. The cameras could have been better.2. IR blaster is missing.3. Notification Led is missing.4. Fingerprint reader is missing.5. Both cameras struggles in low light conditions.6. Comes with miui with full of bloatwares and ads. But they can be disabled and and stopped.WARNING: For non chinese smartphone users if you buy this phone it will com with pre installed chinese apps banned by Indian government bu they will fix it with an ota update so not worry.My Opinion:After using this device I would recommend this device to buyers with budget under 10,000. Everything is good and the updates are also quick and timely. And no problem with the device.

"
"

  After 1 week of usage:Nice battery backup (5000 mah)Nice display qualityGood soundNice camera quality in this budget.Big displayFace lock available however no fingerprint scanner.As said on the box it support wireless FM but it doesn't support wireless FM you need to connect your headphone for FM frequency.Support Fast charging which is very useful thing.Overall nice phone to buy.Thanks to Amazon for the exchange offer.

  Got my new redmi phone. Overall the phone is as per the features, but the quality of camera is not as per the advertisment, selfie camera is better than back camera, you can understand how the back camera is,  previously had Samsung phone with same mega pixel camera, it clicked so well, so here is the sincere request to all buyers, if looking for good camera, don't go for it,

"
"

  this is a good smartphone which comes with the USB Type C, 5000mah Battery, Good Vivid Screen, Gorilla Glass 5 Protection ,Good Camera Dual rear Camera (13mp+2mp), 8mnp selfie camera which u don't find under other smartphones of  this Budget segment  to be noted do not compare with other high budget smartphones camera ABOVE 10Kand in the last latest android 10 update Released in india & latest MIUI 12 is on its way in next month2GB variant performs well  Ram remains all the time under 60% usageThis is Good Buck Performs and Give features u cannot find in other smartphones , and other smartphones which are available i'm sure they are under preform as per the new smartphones of Redmi 9A, Redmi 9 they even also not has these features and comes with the DOWNGRADED REBRANDED PROCESSOR

"
"

  From a budget mobile battery backup and call quality are expected, call quality is pathetic, mic not clear, other party most of the times say that my audio is not clear. Further, earpiece volume is not loud and clear, I am not a power user, just some calls where it frustrated me and some youtube that's it, battery backup is good but what is the use of advancement in technology when it is not performing it's basic task, MI if listening provide good mic, speakers and earpiece for an overall good experience,

"
"

  I expected a little more performance from a redmi phone. It has the typical problems of a 2 GB RAM phone. Really slow. I bought it for my mother. For her use it is just ok. For better performance, a minimum 4 GB RAM phone is needed, no matter which brand you select.

"
"

  I bought this phone for my Father and generally preferred type c charging port which is provided by this 8000 rupee phone , although it has old processor but i must say optimization is good and also look of this is just awesome (not feel like cheap phone).Only draw back is miui which tons of ad but i find a solution to remove unnecessary apps which send anonymous notification.

"
"

  It have sturdy Build Quality . corned with gorilla glass 5 and The display quality is Good.Pros :-Nice Build Quality 10/10Good Camera (both front and back)8/10Smooth performance 9/10Face unlock is pretty fast ( never expected that ) 10/10Good for Mid end gaming 8/10Battery is an absolute monster 10/10Nice display 8/10USB C + fast chasrging 10/10Cons  :-No Finger print censorMy Rating is 8.5/10

"
"

  I don't like this.This is not a good product, I'm huge fan of redmi mobiles,i had also used the phone of this company and that was awesome but this is not good.I will just give only one 🌟 because the phone is not working properly and it is hanging

"
"

  When it comes to budget mobile phones with latest features u cant go wrong with Xiaomi phones. This model is  one such example. You get Good battery, Gorilla screen, big screen size (very big so some 1) etc. Overall value for money!

"
"

  I use this phone more than 5 months I buy it on 4 march 2020 this phone is very very nice 😊👍 in my favor because I buy this phone for my father and it is very easy to use for him and but i brought this phone at range of 6999 rupee and also I see that phone is not lagging and not get heated 🔥  and camera of phone is also niceBut 1 mistake is that his AI screen lock 🔐 not ❌ get open in Instantely but overall this phone cames with 24 hour battery life if you check this phone in volt 📞 and sync and volt to use without power savingBut i see this phone price is geeted increase from 6999++ that shocking for this phone love for people and for peoplepeople and i also play PUBG in a starting months to check the phone performance which is ossom his all sensor almost Avery was working but i don't play now because it my father's mobile 🤣🤣🤣🤣💯💯

"

  Best mobile in this budget, Great battery backup...Just once when mobile received, Pls Go in to settings - Accessibility - OFF will be done.Not any problem shown till now, I purchased this mobile 3 Qty for me - my sister - mh wife. (By different ID's)Not a single problem shoen till now.

"
"

   Hii Everyone...I received this phone in a brand new condition.Everything was fine but there is a technical issue in the software or might be in display....When i used this phone on the very first day i did not notice this error.But next day i saw this fault.The display of the phone was getting hang sometimes...Pixels was bursting also...And there were some glitches on the display when i was using it.So i returned this phone. You may also see the pictures and video which i attached here.It might be a technical error.Otherwise Packaging was good.I received this product too early.It was not a seller's fault.Amazon also refunded the total amount.Thank you Amazon.

"
"

  There is no finger print point,. Camera quality is very cheap & poor even 5000/- phone has better camera. If single camera is better, no need of such dual camera. XIAOMI just making fool. Screen is so so. Battery is good. Overall just 5 yrs back quality.

"
"

  All good, as per the cost, eveey this is appropriate but it could have the fingerprint scanner. Processor and ram is okay for this price... No over heating issue. Good and smooth running. Can play Cod or pubg in medium settings. Battery is okay.. 5 watt charger in the box,, but it supports 18 watt fast chaeger, at this price, in box 5 watt charger is okay but if it could come, it shall be a best option because battery is big 5000 mah. No back cover. All redmk phns come with a back cover. But this is exceptional in this phone. All over 7 out of 10. Performance is excellent but accessories could have been upgraded in the box.

"
"

  Firstly 5 stars to Amazon for delivery this mobile phone with in 24 hours.Coming to this mobile phone, my first impressions are it is working good and I liked it's display.  Especially this low budget phone has Vowifi ( Wifi calling ) feature.  Camera is not good ( don't except much for this low price).  Still review under progress.

"
"

  Nice phone in this price range except bit big to handle . I personally recommend not go for this screen size, as it is very difficult to handle or pick call using one hand (mostly during driving or doing some other work). it is quite slippery, so you land up with cover which makes it too big to keep it in pocket.

"
"

  This review is for REDMI 8A DUAL 3GB RAM 32GB ROM(for use 21gb)Nice budget product. Large battery life last 1-2days. Camera is of average quality. Dual 4g standby. Charger given is of 10 watt. Type c port otg support. No fingerprint . Has face unlock. No ir blaster. Good sound and its quality. Sim tray is risky to use very delicate. Very less heating if you use it continuous

"
"

  Not really value for money, a lot of bloatware comes pre-installed even in October 2020, many ads, faltu apps like hago, Zilli, etc. Are automatically installed within 24 to 48 hours of usage. xiaomi is cheating on everyone by showing they didn't give installed app but they automatically install it from their storage later. For specs you should go for other company phone this is overpriced by ₹500.Camera Quality is not even of 5MP. And front camera just exist for name. Once you see the quality you would not use it again

"
"

  Good phone and value for money, good at memory 3GB.. good response time, speed compared to other android phone with 3GB, may be its new 😊, if you have MI TV, screen mirroring is excellent on the full HD VIEW AND SOUND QUALITY. There’s no delay in streaming at allI bought it for online classes for my kid to use “teams” and “zoom” app streaming on big screen for better view and sound qualityAnd since a month the quality of speed and battery backup is good

"
"

  Thanks Amazon for being care full about your costumer products quality and delivery........ So i am writing an 30day long review.......... Redmi 8a dual is an such an nise phone...... I order it on colour white and ran 2gb rom32gb..... But i could not found any problem with this smartphone .......... I charge this phone for an 2houres just and it's chargeing is 👌👌👌👌very fast .,......... I am an free fire lover and I can easily play free, on this device........ I couldn't see any problem on this device camera quality is also good..,. I suggest all costumer go for....

"
"

  After using 10 days I'm writing this review, camera quality is very poor, display average, phone speed is okay, battery backup is very good, but charging time takes 3 hours, for old age people this phone is good not for youngsters

"
"

  Pretty Much Bang for The Buck if you are on a budget . You know the specs go for it . Don't expect higher performance on this budget . According to the budget Mi is delivering the best value .Now if you have some sentimental ego about Made In India products then my friend go and buy a Banana and pretend you are using a smartphone .Thank You.

"
"

  Budget phone for people who are looking to buy their 1st smart phone in life. I bought it for my mother and she is happy with it. Serves the purpose of a first time smart phone user very well. Ordered grey colour.. looks nice tooFace recognition works only in best light. Not counting it as a negative since it is not a must feature. Camera quality is good ( expect what you will get at this price)

"
"

  So far not happy with this phone , although I am not using it personally now but used it for 2 months . It’s not worth buying . Inferior quality features dines not work well . Application support as well as google store content restriction observed while installing vc apps . Don’t recommend !

"
"

  It was a good phone though it hs 2 BG ram but it looks was pretty good n battery was aswme whch was 5000 not even we get in othr top models and evn the fingerprint sensor r good but if u r buying thn buy wid 3gb or with 4gb wil more bettr

"
"

  On This Price Range Redmi 8A Dual, is best.I brought Sea blue colour smart phone grippy disign 👌. Redmi 8A Dual is best for biginners.Best camera smart phone under 8k.Main camera 13mp 👌,  secondery camera 2mp depth sensor.👍Front camera : average , It's not clicks quality pictures.👎Battery 5000 mAh : normal use 2 - 3 days battery backup.👌Display : average Lcd display.👍But display disign is superb water drop notch display.face unlock is normal but medium fast but good.Best stylish smartphone under this price thanks to Xiaomi.

"
"

  Good battery, just decent processor, can play pubg mobile only with lowest graphics only, if you want a satisfyingly smooth gaming experience, but for all other uses rather than huge games, it's best buy for this money except for moto g8 lite.

"
"

  If u want to buy a phone with ₹7000 budget this is the best phone....Awesome battery life .....speakers are good ....coming to camera I give 3.5/5...not too bad or not too good ...but money worthy

"
"

   1) Product is good but unforunately I have received this product where its Power key button not working, when i have pressed power button it shows FastBoot image logo , then again i pressed power button then it has been started.2) Also its Volume down key not working only upper key working.3) I have Taken Volume Key Button Vedio for your reference.4) If Possible contact with us because I need replacement not a refund, But when sending new device kindly check on your end all features and all physical accesseries (Like Button, Battery,Charger are in good condition i.e working properly)

"
"

  Really very nice and looks for this mobile but unfortunately thee mobile is not charging up. After contacting the customer care and they did test using the blancoo diagnostic app and confirmed the same. I have asked the replacement for this mobile but they are stated as this is service not possible & refunded the amount.Now I'm looking foe the new mobiles like redmi 9 but not able to place the order while flash sale time.

"

  Great value for moneyGreat battery lifeDoesn't hang in day to day tasksType c port with support for 18 watt chargingScreen is good for its priceCamera takes good pictures in day light but in artificial light and low light the quality is trash

  Very bad product, delivered on 12th July 2020 and I'm writing this review on 1st August 2020, the phone hanged, no app is opening, after restarting also same problem, I brought it for online studies now have to give it in service centre , very bad experience with this phone, recommend not to buy it for anyone.

"
"

  Please dond buy this...one of the worst mobile.keeps disconnected to the network and internet speed was very bad..same sim is working well in other mobile..When I purchased it was 7k,,that itself i felt wated money..Now they increased to 8200,,I dont know what makes it worth..Please dont buy this...

"
"

  Phone hangs and it behaves what ever way it want example it open wats app nd  clicks on Send nd send nd send... Without human intervention I am wondering did I bought mobile or Robot which is frustrated

"
"

  Thanx to Amazon for its fast delivery, in just 2 days..I love shopping on Amazon.One of the best phones under 9K.Redmi has proved its worth..a very good one for daily usage of social media apps like YouTube, Facebook, instagram, etc.. camera & audio quality is also very good..Also games can be played, design & midnight Black colour is simply awesome..Very good as of now I'll update after 1 month.

"
"

  If you are facing problems with the phone accessories, they do not consider it as a problem. If you want to return, they won't allow to do that. They just give chance for replacement and the replaced product may come even worse than before.The Adapter gets heated like a hair-straighter within 10 mins. I asked for a technician and they provided one after 3 weeks. I had to order replacement and the replaced product came even worse. The phone itself started heating along with the defective adapter.

"
"

  It is very initial review based on 3 days usage.First review for Amazon: Excellent experience with Amazon till date. Wonderful buying and up-to-date delivery by Amazon. Thanks.Now mobile: I purchased this redme phone for my wife by looking her usage. Handset is perfect for her and working as per the expectations. Detailed review will write after 3 months.

"
"

  1) Product- Product is good, value for money and handy.2) Delivery- Best delivery experience. Many times on time delivery followed.3) Service- Better service provided by Amazon and product seller. Nice...Keep It Up...Thanks to Amazon...

   Power button not working properly hence returned. Screen guard ordered separately there is return option. Amazon team i hope will help in this case.

  Nice phone good in 6.499 is realy nice but not so fast working when open lock it will take 4 to 5 I have to swipe than is open why this happen I don't know  n other things is battery drain fast just in 5000 mh so with use 12hr net than almost 1 day only

"
"

  Product is some what ok. Because my sister needed in this price. Seller APPARIO package is very worst. I give 1 star to seller. Just packed with cover.  No care. Worst packaging.

"
"

  Superb phone at this budget and excellent value for money plus all the features built in with the latest version of technology and software, the only thing is that it is without finger print sensor, but at this budget it is acceptable. 👍👌

"
"

  Pathetic mobile phone in cheaper price. They are not only accepting return the phone but also denying to replace it. Still I'm keep on talking to their technician and they are doing their practicals on that mobile phone by requesting to install other app, switching on and off, updating software. I'm so exhausted now with the Amazon service. I had so much trust on Amazon now their representatives and technicians are forcing me not to believe in Amazon anymore.

"
"

  My Experience is...Do not buy 2 GB Variant mobile as now days most of latest mobile run on Andorid 10 which need minimum 3 GB to run all application smoothly. while i am using app its lack many time.. Sometimes its crashes.. its a worst experience when you are using New Mobile and it doesn't meet minimum Expectation..Don't Expect Good Selfie camera,  Overall mobile is Good.Its support Fast charging is quiet nice feature given in this Price price range.Pls buy Min. 3 GB Ram Variant

"

  As per add, it was 10v charger along with the box, but in box it was 5V charger...Due to this wrong charger it is taking over 3 hours to charge 100%.... Also this charge is getting drain before Eod..Absolutely unhappy..So I would suggest, pls pay extra and go for a better mobile than this low end models....

  I purchased mobile Redmi 8A Dual from Amazon, After one month mobile is auto shut many times.Whenever call is received phone goes auto switch & auto shut.Battery is also not good, discharge within 12 hours.

"
"

  Screen is LCD, not vibrant at all. Contains lot of bloat ware. One thing I liked are the alert tones. Better buy Samsung galaxy m series. This phone is good for gifting... Gifting parents or dumb girlfriends

"
"

  it's a very good product in the market at a reasonable and affordable price.  i had purchased it for my kids for online classes and it is serving the purpose very well.it's 5000 mah battery is good. overall its a best buy.

"
"

  It seems i received a defective piece and now after the purchase of 10 days the mobile works automatically ... When I call amazon they are saying return policy is over and they cannot do anything... It really lack of services and amazon should take action on this because they are the one delivering the product.. Really disappointed and helpless ...

"
"

  I previously gifted it to one of my girlfriends. Now I bought again for another girlfriend because all are equal to me. The phone is good because it has a good battery backup time and good performance. But only disappointed me because it doesn't have a fingerprint sensor. I compared the phone with my Galaxy S10 lite and found a huge difference. From the display to the performance, all feacher in the S10 lite is awesome.

"
"

  Overall, the product is as described except the charger, only a 10W charger is included in the box.I think the handset is bit heavy though I have not checked the weight of handsets of other brands in this price range.I will write a detailed review after using it for some time.

"
"

  Seems like software problems with deviceVery bad experience i had with mi really disappointed. Customer care not responding don't know what should i do now.. Request to amazon please find some way..

"
"

  Best in this segment in terms of battery life and other features. don't have IR blaster, camera is average. keep min 1GB RAM space empty to run high end games Turbo game booster option do the job.Need to see in the long run.

"
"

  Phone is okay, basic phone with 2gb, smooth UI, but I remember xiaomi came up with 5a it was smaller and weigh lesser than this. I purchased this phone for my dad, its too heavy and slips a lot other than that it's okay.

"
"

  The phone was bought for the daughter of an employee to attend online classes. She is extremely happy and able to attend online classes.hence the purpose & objective for purchase has been fulfilled.

"
"

  Product is all-over good but it will be helpful if seller provide the tax invoice or purchase bill in some hard printing material. It will be useful in future to us.

"
"

  This product is very good.But after 20 days the phone was 1st time hang.Now it takes almost 3 hour to be fully charged.Sometime the touch screen is not responding,after restart it works normally.Due to lockdown and current situation I can't go to the nearest service centre.So I am very upset.Please advice me what I should do.

"
"

  There's no fingerprint reader, it would be good if they'd have mentioned it, but i gotta say that I'm amazed by the face recognition reader, it's a lightweight gigantic phone with powerful processor.For the budget, it's a worth buying. Just go for it!!!PS - I just received it so wait for the further update.

"
"

  Bigger battery, nice processor, good camera. Budget phone in this price segment. It's quite ok for the daily staff. The build quality and the back panel is the main highlights. But quite disappointed that no back cover is in with phone.

"
"

  Just a couple of days latter, the phone started behaving abnormally. Application would open on their own randomly. Seemed liked some spot on the touch screen remain pressed and it kept opening up apps. Had to reboot it everytime to sort this out.The phone otherwise works smooth. But this above problem has occurred a multiple of time which has soured my experience.

"
"

  I have not tested the Mobile couz its a gift.But hats off to Xiaomi for bringing phones in this price point with so much specifications.Its a high time for Non-Chinese brands do something or loose the market to China !!

"
"

  Phone quality is good and battery life is also good ..in this range 7499 ... 5000 mah battery and dual camera all are best...Bt only a thing there is no finger print...... Only face lock.. bt it's okkk...It's best phone......

"
"

  This is my 3rd Redmi Phone. I had Redmi 2, Redmi 4, and this is my Redmi 8A Dual. The only drawback what Noticed is Finger Print Missing. I have  lots of apps which require authentication. In my Redmi 4 I had finger print So I unlocked easily all my apps without entering the password / PIN. But in Redmi 8A Dual, I have to manually enter all those keys. Its really pathetic sometime. But other than that I didn't found any other brand who is offering  3GB 64GB for Rs 8999.

"
"

  Superb Phone. Value for Money. MI is always a trusted brand in India. Excellent battery life, faster processorfor general use,  good call quality,  Camera is also good. Go for it guys. At this price level, no other phone can beat this phone

"
"

  Awesome battery backup...Best camera in this price ..Processor is working good not best above average..Overall best in price...

"
"

  It is a good phone and value for money. But itsCamera is not very good.It has high perfomance and great battery capacity.But it has no fingerprint lock system. The phone is very smooth and it has several other quality. The phone can duplicate one app to double.all over it is a good and value for money.I like the product because it is smooth,high battery perfomance and high phone performance

"
"

  Worst product. But more disappointing is Amazon service. The phone started malfunctioning after a few days. First it started hanging and then began off and on all on a sudden.  The problem started just before an hour of scheduled replacement. Initially I thought it is a temporary problem. But when I discovered that the problem is permanent I tried for replacement. But the return window had closed just 5 minutes earlier. Because of 5 minutes delay Amazon didn't care for my repeated request.

"
"

  Very poor product within 4 months the mobile hanged and when took to service centre and they flashed the memory and restarted it after 2 more restarts one more given to service centre and one at home now again hanged Service centre is now recommends change of mother board. When there is a repetitive issue within warranty should not the equipment be replaced however now after warranty the problem is mine

"
"

  When package arrived , got feared like this could be dummy item (junk) by the way it was packed , inside box edge was scrapped , In order to be safety measure , started recording for opening the box , phone was fine for price paid , packaging skills need to be improved by the retailer , when it travels long distance ,packaging matters all on the product.

"
"

  I am facing the screen flickering while using ICICI Mobile banking. is there anyone who is facing the same problem.and any guideline to solve this .so many unuseful apps are available.unable to disable like stock Android...better to go with stock android phone

"
"

  The phone doesn't have a fingerprint scanner but then again with this price range, I did not expect it to have one. Battery life is really good. Even with the dual camera, the quality of pictures suuck really bad. Using Instagram for pictures will help on this device. The 2 GB ram is not at all sufficient for a smartphone these days. If you're shifting from one app to another, the phone lags. Even when you back to home screen after heavy usage of any app, it lags.

"
"

  Nice product with good battery life.For normal use,browsing, you tube, and other uses it is good choice.Redmi mobile are value for money. In affordable prices you get much more.

"
"

  Display quality, camera quality are very poor. App icons on the screen appear hazy. I wasted my money.

"
"

  this phone is very very e nice and mid range is super best value for money phone redmi 8a dualthis phone in battery super charger super display sound quality superb but camera very very badspecial thank you For MI India and Amazon all team very very very thank youthis phone mid range very nice price and me e recommended this phone purchase you all of you

"
"

  This is a basic notch smart phone.... Good for middleaged useres or normal basic user...Front camera is good but rear camera is not that much good... but good for this price... Battery life is so good... but no fast charging... And finger print scanner( may be u will not get  finger print  with any phone in this price range )...  Bought it for my uncle... Look wise its soooo beautiful... Processor nad working is average

"
"

  Recently purchased a week back... Very poor battery backup... The company is claiming 5000mah... It will it is not even 2000mah....it doesnt even last for more then 6hrs...withour even usage... Very poor product... Please dont purchase mi products... Worst

"
"

  Its so worse that when product performance is not good there is NO OPTION TO RETURN. I couldn't even place return order on the day it got delivered. The reason given is so stupid: ""It contains battery, so can't be returned"". Come on, expected something better atleast. Worst ever experience to me after using Amazon for 5 years.Please think twice before ordering anything valuable on Amazon. This would be my last order

"
"

  This is defective products touch automatically worked  Amazon seller cheating a customer defective products send not purchase amazon and seller apprilo seller  you purchase other site I used this products 10 day but today hang automatically  I going to xiaomi service center but not accept it is defective  I blame you fell down this mobile but not fell down this is the modus operandi cheating a customer and Amazon 10 returns period end  seller repair products send me

"
"

  The build quality seems to be good. But the performance is nowhere near what it should deliver! Hasn't even been a week and it already is showing signs of slowing down...

"
"

  MI Remote not working. I purchased Redmi MI 8A mobile phone 8 Sep then replace it again i purchased same then it arrived on 20 Sep that same mobile's MI remote not working and some other was i facing then I raised the complaint. That also replace after it mobile arrived on 4th Oct. In this mobile phone also not working MI Remote.I would like to suggest you, if you are going to use all features of MI Redmi 8A then don't go for it.

"
"

  The phone is absolutely great. I got the phone in 6550₹ in Amazon independence sale. The camera quality both rear and front is great, 5000mah battery is a great advantage with fast charging. Although the processor is old but seems to be working smooth. The phone back panel matte texture feels absolutely great.

"
"

  After 2 month phone outgoing voice not working,And customer service is Redmi not proper responce, they provide only 10 day service not 1 year serviceI recommend don't buy this phone because of customer service

"
"

  Good phone for the price paid...budget friendly for online classes for students...But be aware...I bought it thinking that XIAOMI is making phone in india...but it's actually importing it from china...and further more only replacement option is available... no return policy..

"
"

  Good phone at this price with a large display and a 13mp+2mp rear camera and a 8mp front camera a 5000mAh battery. Big drawback is the absence of finger scanner. But a good product over all.

"
"

  The phone started acting up as soon as it was turned on--the camera doesn't work (as soon as camera is turned on the screen goes dark!), the phone wouldn't ring for WhatsApp calls, the WhatsApp video call function doesn't work as the camera would make the screen go dark. Do not buy from Appario Retail Pvt Ltd--I don't know why AMAZON allows these kinds of dishonest retailers who sell defective products on their site! Very bad experience.

"
"

  Great phone in this price range with sd439, battery life is good , it comes with C type charging facility it is a good pointPurchase only for basic use not for gaming.

"
"

  It will be in the form of brick in your hand, UI sucks to the core, still there are betterr options, face lock is a joke. the processor is way old could not handle multiple task. Does not able to support dual band in WIFI. Think before you guys buy it

"
"

  Battery is good but processor is slow work.Sounds quality is average.Wi-Fi connection is very bad. OTP generation is very bad ofter one minute late arriving OTP SMS.Finger print sensors not provide.First time users can take this phonePhone design is best👍 in blue colour.Overall good phone in this Price range if service center service is good.But I am not satisfied this phone.

"
"

  this mobile we have 3 pieces ay home, using since 8 months, and it works like a charm in all media, gaming also work without any problem. best phone in the market, USB-C is a bonus.

"
"

  Everythin is good...!!I got it @7649rs during primday sale...!!But processer is low i.e 439SDCamera is as per value of money...!!Battery is good...!!

"
"

  It is a good phone. Nice and superb in model, and long life 5000 mah battery, absolutely good for gaming. It provide full screen option and swith option is nice thing. Camera is not out standing but very good. Dual Sim, dual camera and smart face lock. Good in quality, power full glasses and smooth. Advanced features available  here. Not only is good phone but also it's helpful. Low cost but quality is very good.

"
"

  This device has great battery life.But it's volume buttons are not working properly, after a week.Full of ads.But other features are good.It has no any fingerprint sensor. As well as ""face unlock"" is very slow.Don't buy, if you are a gamer or college studend.I recommend you redmi Note 7s or 7pro, redmi Note 8 or 8 pro.This smartphone has very low RAM.which is not sufficient for a student ...(Multitasking)

"
"

  I bought this mobile for my Grandmother. As per her usage, it's quite good but when it comes to usage by me. It wouldn't meet the need. Camera quality is pretty average but it is decent as per the pricing. Battery life is good. It easily gives around two days for normal usage. It's handy and perfect for normal users overall it's a good mobile for normal users.

"
"

  Nice phone in such an economical range. Battery life and camera quality is good. Fingerprint reader is also quick and easily readable. Screen size and phone storage is also ok. What else could one get in such a price range.Nice phone for those who want in the range of below 8k.

"
"

  The phone is good for usual browsing or low end games. You can play high end games like PUBG on low settings still with a small lag. One of cons is it doesn't have a fingerprint reader but has a 2D face unlock which works fine. Camera quality is okaish, what you expect from an under 10k smartphone. Best part is its 5000 mah battery, also supports 18 W fast charging but comes with 10 W charger. Overall a good budget phone.

"
"

  Device is very good in this price. Touch is not that fast. Meets needs of basis Android well. Earphone and back cover should have been included. Sound quality is loud enough. Overall grade phone.

"
"

  Can blindly buy this mi product for the UI, looks, resolution, battery life and the economic price. We received 10% discount during the independence day sale. Cant be happier! Go for it!

"
"

  Lovely product at lowest price

"
"

  Waste of time money and energy. This Phone did not even last for 10 days

"
"

  Superb amazing phoneUnless sd 439 no heating issues not foundBattery backup is amazingBut it have 10w charger on box super phone but only it has 2 gb ram it is not enough for gamers  and also it a good phone for average user camera quality is super and face unlock is faster best battery  backup for normal users sometimes  it hang

"
"

  Redmi 8A dual is a better one but this time price is higher than normal. I purchase it Rs-8200/- which should be around 6500- 6999. Due to necessity i purchased it.

"
"

  Budget Smartphone, very good performnce, I booked for my relative. He is using it, no complaint from him. But camera littile bit dull.  Other wise great smartphone in this price. Go for it.

"
"

  I have been using Mi phones for couple of years and happy with my experience. So I blinday went for Redmile 8A dual which is really affordable with big screen long battery life and sleek design. Thanks amazon

"
"

  Phone us superb at this Price range. No phone is Better below 8k.Though it is a chinese phone but se Dont have any swadeshi phone in india. So Better to buy this phone if you have less money.Bought it @6500₹ at sale..Battery is super Awsome.. Camera is so so in this Price Its Very good.Dont think much just go fir it. You will Definatly love this Beautiful phone specialy blue one.

"
"

  The Redmi 8A phone's camera quality is stunning with long battery life. FM and sound quality are fabulous. Looks and ocean blue colour is better.The main thing easily changes with other Indian languages. No lagging for games.

"
"

  I brought this phone for my mother. The interface, sensor, camera quality is great and other features are also nice.  Easy to use.If you want a budget phone then you must go for this one.

"
"

  I am reviewing it after 2 months of usage...i will definitely say the battery life is amazing ..But the phone is lagging too much...even you cant play normal games like clash of clans, garden escapes ..also you can see so much lag while doing multitask...like whatsapp fb youtube..Camery is avg ..you cant expect great camera in this rangeBut i will suggest realme c3 ..c3 is way better than redmi 8a dual device..

"
"

  No fingerprint,. No infrared..OK but.. Given hardware is also bad.Camera worste.Sound quality is bad.2gb ram its my failure choice.Its just a phone with basic features.I don't why. Corporates finally blam customers. They want to enjoy the blood of customers to make money.Waste of money.Degraded features.

"
"

  While the phone is very good at this price, from processor and features perspective, annoyingly the charger came alongwith is pathetically slow....I had put my phone on charge for half an hour and the charge moved up just by 3%. Need a replacement of charger pls.

"
"

  Speakers are not powerful enough and call quality is poor .. returned product and got refund thanks to amazon

"
"

  No back cover, no screen guard, no fingerprint sensor, and no earphone in box, very bad camera, weak plastic backside. The screen broke after falling from 1 meter distance. I'm very unsatisfied by this phone. Also this is cheap china mobile. Avoid buying this phone. Don't waste money on this phone. Put some more money and get samsung, lg or apple mobile. You will regret after buying this phone.

"
"

  Battery is good enough. But camera is third class..camera is not as i expected in a 7500Rs. Phone. If you make call in speaker mode then the other side would not be able to hear you properly. One more..if you use few more apps then it's use to getting hang. Very disappointing..😣😣

"
"

  I was not fully confident to purchase phone on online. That too 8000 up to.. With Amazon I had a hope.. They are best and trustworthy.. Hence its proved.. .. I'm so happy..  I got sea blue. . I love the color. . Camera quality is sooo good.. Battery life is amazing.. I chargd 96 per onday before yesterday .. Yesterday full day I used my mobiles.. Today still have 38 percentage. . .im sooo satisfied with this product.. Thanku amazon

"
"

  There is no fingerprint reader but the battery life is amazing of thumping 5000mah and the camera quality is also nice with zooming capability up to 8x. Overall the phone is nice. It has a nice design and is large enough and I think it has infinity display and I think it is better than the price though I am reviewing it on the day I got it I will edit this review after 2-3 months of usage.

"
"

  Happy with the product.Look wise,function wise and battery wise this product is good and if you are looking for a decent phone for regular use then can easily go for it.It provides many features at much lower range than many others which are charging you higher for same stuff

"
"

  The phone is very good for single hand use.The screen size is perfect for watching videos.Design of the phone is also good.We r getting type C charger out of the box and it also supports fast charging.The camera quality is decent for the price range.

"
"

  Using it for last one week and performance is very bad. Can't even use the WhatsApp. Hanging regularly.

"
"

  Pros:Good Battery lifeCompact and easy to handleExcellent Design in its segmentCons:Little bit slowVerdict:If you are a basic user go for it.....If you are a gamer it will disappoint you...

"
"

  Worst product this is, hanging problem since purchase, I never thought MI phone has such quality. I never suggest anyone to buy this one. Processor is too slow.

"
"

  I would say the camera qaulity is better but not the best at this price Point. Battery is Excellent but sometimes it feels like that the battery is 4000mah and one Major problem is there is fingerprint however the face unlock is awesome all over things are Great but the price should be at 8000 not 8999 . I AM using it from 2months and there is no hang problem but android 10 update battery is running fastly

"
"

  No finger print reader.Very good battery life.Average camera( better with Google cam app than the inbuilt one).Truly worth money product in 7k range smart phones of all brands.I bought 3gb 32gb for 6999 don't know why they are now selling the same 8.3k .Any way good phone and not for high end gaming.

"
"

  The returned product has the same problem as before. Not a got phone to buy. This phone has a very slow and bad processor, it hangs or crashes ALL THE TIME. The plastic used for theconstruction of the back is very cheap. You cannot use this phone with patience or Calmness. It is a very bad phone. I do not recommend you buying this phone

"
"

   I ordered and got delivery.For first two days it worked fine. On third battery was at 10% and I opened the WhatsApp, then suddenly colored strips started appearing on screen. Not just WhatsApp, but for google also. See attached video for details.I asked  amazon for replacement but they are asking me to send it by courier in this lock down times.Pathetic product..

"
"

  During this pandemic, I had lost hope that I will get a premium smartphone under 9000 rupees but Amazon made it possible.  No doubt performance of this mobile phone is quite good. Battery life is awesome. Camera quality is not very good but if you look the price of this phone it's ok. Screen appearance and sound quality is also up to the mark. Fingerprint scanner is missing in this phone while fingerprint reader is working well.

"
"

  Worst phone 👎👎👎👎👎👎 not purchase it please..... Redmi is a cheap company fake battery performance and no chroma boostHangs a lot after few days of purchase ......, worst ever

"
"

  Superb phone. this phone I purchased for my 13 year old daughter for her online zoom classes. Two time she dropped the phone from her hand but thankfully nothing happens. This proves that this is quite hardy set too. She is happy with the phone because she don't have to charge it every after each class like before. One day full charge means no need to charge for nxt 2-3 days. Super.

"
"

  Very avg product. Got it for 8300 ..3/32 gb. Camera 2/5Display worst 2/5.Battery life 5/5.Performance 3/5.Audio (speaker)3/5.Overall 3/5.

"
"

  Don't be fooled this mobile isn't what they are showing!!  Battery isn't 5000 mah coz it hardly works only for one day...camera quality is not that good specially of front camera!!

"
"

  Best in this Price. Design is Amazing. I brought Sea Blue colour. Camera is Awesome, Portrait Mode is Outstanding. Battery Life is Really Good, easily last for One and Half Day even if you use your Smartphone Continuously.Now, the MIUI 11 is best SOS Based on Android 9 Pie.You Should Really Go For It.You will not be Disappointed.It is Best in this Budget.Very very very Happy...........🤗🤗🤗🤘🤘

"
"

  Before When I used redmi Note 5, I can't call any body at particular area...But now  BSNL tower is displayed and i can call everybody ...and camera is so good...Battery life i charged yesterday at 2:00PM 96% ... tomorrow till 10:45AM , 89% display , in Between cap i used data 2 Hrs, speak 1 Hr,

"
"

  All the phone specs in Redmi 8a Dual are great! but Redmi 8a Dual phone has a primary camera of 13+2 mp and  secondary phone camera of 8 mp. But the pictures clicked from the  primary camera are only 12 mp and the pictures clicked from secondary camera are only 6 mp.

"
"

  It's too good smart phone at budget price but there is no fingerprint scanner, slow processor but it's quite good at this price point and redmi provides type C port and 18 watt fast charging support, good grip design which doesn't come in other Brand smartphones.

"
"

  Good mobile but its made in china manufacture not made in india, so I am not satisfied. I heat china.

"
"

  I have already used redmi 4a which good for one and half year but after that phone started issues of touch problem and ghost touch problem, i frequently heard from friends who using redmi phones.Now new phone itself a problem though it seems not a great problem but led backlights in screen cleary visible in bottom. It seems okay now. But in future not sure about that. Will see for next few or i will return.

"
"

  Battery is average not good enough as given in specifications.As per specifications battery backup during video play back is 34 hours but I guarantee that you will have to charge it thrice in 34 hours.Charager becomes heat after 30 min of charging. And according to battery charger has low capacity to charge.I don't like this phone.I will have to return this phone.

"
"

  To be honest with you guys rhus phone is superbI am actually a heavy user an thus phone is perfectly perfect at this price. Battery is fabulous camera is just so clear (better then vivo and oppo) and display is also big but it only lacks at fingerprint by the way apple 11 series also doesn't have fingerprint so thisphine is perfect.Believe me guys this a smart choice and smart move too

"
"

  I am giving a Delivery day review!Looks good and I hope it'll work good as well! Used YouTube for a while and it got a little hot, I hope it's not a bad sign or something.And yaa it's a good phone at this range.

"
"

  User guide - Not able to read because of very small letters  and illegibleWarranty details not knownWhether this is having Finger print  identity>Detailed booklet on instructions and about REDMI 8A  dual 3 GB / 64 GB Storage not available  These items may be arranged for my referenceDisplay Brightness level  automatic adjustment  case is not clear

"
"

  I bought it on Apr.. now Jun 2nd... It's getting too heat... Not able to use it more than half hour.. it's getting too heat . Am not happy with the. Product. ....

"
"

  Phone performance good under this price. But the facelock feature is unlocking the mobile at a slower speed. Sometimes recognizing the face but not unlocking just shows facelock verifying, i need to enter the password to unlock. Facelock feature not working properly

"
"

  At 6500 price best phone I get the camera quality is also nic with this price and the over whole features is also nic.Night image is also ok ok because at this price we cannot except to much clearity but the image we can see is nic.

"
"

  Excellent product. Battery performance very good. Cleaner app effective. Feature of auto turn off at night and turn on in morning (savev on battery) effective. Camera is also very good.

"
"

  Battery and performance are good comparing to the price but 1 disadvantage is that this product came with 10w charger adapter this make it slow charging so you would prefer a batter charger adapter like 18w adapter but overall it is a very good product with less price👍

"
"

  1) Just its 2 days, now call center is saying hardware issue is there since it's not operating properly.2) Camera quality is poor3) Auto brightness mode doesn't work properly4) Wifi doesn't get connected, they are asking to check at service center.

"
"

  Very bad phone

"
"

  Pros:Battery life of the phone is good.Quick charge optionPicture clarity is good.Cons:Camera quality is not so greatLil heavierWith in a month , the power charger isn't working.All the videos are played in slow motion as there was no sync between the motion and the audio.. I had to install the VLC for playing the videos.

"
"

  On box the list of contains was there. In which gorilla glass was mentioned.. but on opening of box, we found only poly cover of gorrilla glass but gorrilla glass was missing.. which indicates that the item gorrilla glass was intensively removed from the mobile box before dispatched..  which is directly cheating with customer... not good... the dispatcher should be blacklisted..

"
"

  this is ultimate budget mobile in this range. and the battery life is just awesome. my mom use it . and she needs to charge it once a week. just a quality mobile

"
"

  Battery drains a lot. 5000 mah .is useless. even with average usage, it lasts only a day. Even in stand by battery drains.Its only the price and decent performance that I have given it 3 star else would have chosen only 1 star.

"
"

  Low Quality mobile...Don't buy  1).Sometimes Touch not work  2).Camera Quality is Average  3).Many adds are coming  4).App icon size are large  5).Does not moving files to sd card Overall this mobile is Waste...Battery only best but all performance are poor..touch not work,No sd card move i am very irritating...Choose another mobile at this price range

"
"

  Received the cell 8dual in proper condition. Thanks Amazon, but the warranty card, user guide and sim pin was missing. Please do the needful. Before dispatching please go through the item . Rest is fine

"
"

  This is my first time to order this phone online. It is really amazing. My friend told me not to buy phone online due to defect but i took a risk n i saved 1000/- bcoz market price is around 8500/-But they were wrong there's no defect.I really love it... N battery life is also very good... Thank you Amazon❤

"
"

  I was Micromax Q334 which has 5 Mp. camera which is far far better than RedMI 8A Dual 13 MP camera. Battery backup is good but it takes so much time to charge , approximately 2 hours for full recharge. and rest are good

"
"

  Pro- Slim and easy to handle- best in price- overall experience is goodConc- Mi unwanted apps-dont like MI operating that muchIt should be easy to use

"
"

  Battery back is very poor. It takes 3 hours for fully charge the phone and drain in 10 hours with normal use.Don not go for this mobile if you want good battery back up. The battery claim is false.

"
"

  Friends, never buy this mobile, it's a fault mobile. My mobille facing battery problem and display issue after 8 days of delivery. Both MI and Amazon refuse to replace. MI service is very poor and so guys never choose this mobile. MI service center informed me that 10 days replacement warranty is applicable for Flipkart only. I don't know what to do. Anyway I cheeted by MI and Amazon.

  Very comfortable product.  Good battery life also. They not provide phone back cover.  The fresh phone how to without use of back cover.  Please add back cover in this type phone.Camera clarity average. Face recognition perfect. Sound clarity, display size also good.  No fingerprint reader in this product then why you add  Star review on fingerprint reader in this page. I can't understand that.

  Good average phone little costlyCan get infinix with major upgradeCamera not worth itProcessor fineMemory fineIts averageIts too costly

"

  One of the worst phones out there, it started to hang in just one month I didn't expect that with a new device. All of a sudden the screen goes blank and keeps blinking battery is decent, camera is ok for this price but the performance is worst and one more upsetting factor that i did noticed after receiving no fingerprint sensor

"
"

  I loved the product battery life is good. Display and camera qaulity is ok.But I am very much disappointed with dilevery boy (Satish) he was very rude, even he was not following the rules for Covid-19. I have done shopping in past from Amazon and flipkart but never experienced this kind of behavior from dilevery boy

"
"

  I buy this mobile . battery  is awesome more than 1 day it's life.Battery charging time - 2.30 hrs with 2amp chargerCamera - averageProcesser - slow  while simple usage its frame dropTime for opening an app back to home screen is 2-3 sec which is very high. Some bug are still after update. Please resolve it

"
"

  Battery life goodPerformance not goodSome times it's not properly respondingCamera not a good oneAlways signal loosing

"
"

  Overall worthy smartphone• Battery life so good• Camera is good for daily need purpose• Display better result• fingerprint not available but faceunlock works.

"
"

  In this price range it is a good choice. Battery life is good. No lag till now. But camera should be better. Low light photography is very poor. Camera always suffer from low light. Selfie camera is decent. Overall a budget phone for day to day work. Don't expect more from this.

"
"

  If you thinking to buy a budget phone redmi 8a dual is great package.negative side-1)You don't get fingerprint scanner2)Even it is redmi phone you didn't get IR Blaster means there is no option of MI remote.3)camera is decent. Portrait mode is not that good.4)This phone supports 18w charger but you get 10w charger in box.5)you didn't get case in box.

"
"

  The display started failing 2 days after the return period ended. Started to automatically open and close apps. Screen would randomly go black, go to the lockscreen and unlock automatically. Since it started failing just after the return period ended makes it seem like this is a planned SCAM. I would recommend not to buy this phone.

"
"

  What a awesome service by Amazon!! Even in this pandemic time, really impressed.Amazon delivered the product on time.Phone is really good, I gifted this phone to my parents and they liked it. Reasonable price with all features.

"
"

  This phone one of good this price range, c type charger, dual camera 8 mp front, 5000mah battery

"
"

   Good battery backup, decent camera & bright display at this price point but there is no finger print censor and the other hand delivery time is also once again 60% faster than Flipkart.

"
"

  This is the best mobile I have ever seen under budget, ❤❤❤this mobile is good for all , easy to use, various themes are their . Good camera clearity. You can play pubg without any glitch. Two sim slot. And the speaker is owsmmmm.. The sound is tooo loud... Which is great for music lovers 😍😍😍😍. You can go for it.... This is like""CHOTA PACK BADA DHAMAKA""

"
"

  this is China product and take a lot of confusion while operating. Apps and software not updated as per new Indian rules. Getting confussion and delay in operating the phone

"
"

  No finger print available.Battery life is better.Camera is average. sound quality is better. Overall it's avg phone with this range of 8k.

"
"

  It has no fingerprint.Battery life is good.Camera quality for this price segment is very good.No lag.Overall it is a good choice for this price segment.

"
"

  No ir ,no fast charger in the box,but great phone with good processes and battery,camera ok ok, look great,in hand feel owsome

"
"

  At this price range this is the best phoneYou can do decenet gamingCamera is awesomeBattery backup nearly 10hrs continuous useCharges in 2 and half hoursPhone is very strong with tempered glass I dropped nearly 10 times from 5feet height no single damageIf your budget is below 10k this phone will reach your expectations

"
"

  Samsung m30 is best performer for a 10k phone. Camera is good and chinese phone cameras are nowhere close to it. Massive 5000mah battery with 15w fast charging. Only issue is battery heats even after a 5-min call. Samsung please bring some update to fix it. SAMSUNG is amazing.

"
"

  The phone comes at an attractive price yet offers good features, particularly the battery. There are many apps from mi that might get a tad annoying, make sure to switch off notifications, an easy work around.Camera and sound quality are decent. Phone performs and responds well.

"
"

  Display remain in that photo shownThat mobile does not any activities.Care persons not contact to that problem after inform to customer careVery worst responseCustomer care every time I call they told transfer to senior and after 5 mins call will be disconnected they rotene 5 times my money total waste.next time I don't buy on that website total cheet

"
"

  Best mobile in class because it has Qualcomm Snapdragon processor and type C port with 18w fast charge , and Qualcomm quick charge 3 support, it's better then redmi 9A, Redmi 9i.

"
"

  Satisfactory phone because of it's price!! A fine offering for ₹8000 phone but the issue of hanging continuously and the high heating problem makes me angry!!!No heavy apps are installed still after only 1 month of use such problems are arising....It's better to go for ₹10000 Or more but not this one!!

"
"

  I AM FIRST TIME USER OF REDMI PHONE.AT THIS COST THIS PHONE IS BEST.P-HONE IS WORKING SMOOTHLY.ALL GAME ARE RUN SMOOTHLY. NFS RUN OKAY.BATTERY LIFE IS GOOD.CAMERA QUALITY IS NOT GOOD. BELOW AVERAGE.FINGERPRINT READER IS NOT AVAILABLE IN THIS PHONE.

"
"

  Good product,only 2 colour variant only available to improve the colour variant and then,expand RAM space and ROM,Good looking,I feeling like heavy weight,Quick charging all very good working,No fingerprint,Good camera,Gaming performance was ok,Battery life good

"
"

  Mobile hanging intermittently, sometimes touchscreen not responding. Camera quality is not satisfactory. I was using different models of Redmi mobiles since last few years. But it's bye bye time... Amazon not returning this mobile within stipulated time frame 26/08/2020 from purchase date 18/08/2020.

"
"

  If you planing to get best looking phone for nearly 7000 redmi 8a dual is the best option to buy among all others. Display is right on part, battery is awesome, supports fast change 2.0 (18W), cemera is decent for video calls, and fells like durable device on hands.

"
"

   Mobile is so light weighted,and thanx to amozon to delivered timely. Camera picture quality very good and i give 10/10 for performance.

"
"

  Its a really good model at this price range. With good battery life and great camera quality. It also comes with 32gb internal memory and 2 gb ram which is also quite good. Fast charging and gaming speed is good too.And redmi is a very well-known brand.If you don't want much high featured mobile then its for you. Give it a try

"
"

  Pros-First look: Great built quality, looks like a 13k phone not 7.5k.Display quality seems like full HD.Camera quality (front and back) better than Motorola g5s plus(13MP) and portrait mode is great at this price point.Cons:Slightly lagging appears.

"
"

  Very bad. When calling the voice of other person is not clear. I think some kind of defect with my handset. Kindly guide me how to claim warranty?

"
"

  The phone was working well for a few weeks. Then suddenly started shutting down in middle watching a video or WhatsApp. It's been only 3 months since I have purchased this one. This was the first experience of smart phone for my Mom. Can't be a more pathetic experience. I need help to exchange this. I am unable to find a way to reach out. Please help.

"
"

  Noooo fingerprint s there..bt ask fr d ratings of finger print 😂..therz nly face unlock .... Mbl S gud enough with some latest apps.... Overall pick up some gud n reasonable..

"
"

  i bought it for my grandpa. this is good phone. not a gaming focused phone but will get your daily task fairly easily.it heats up during charge but its normal for 18w charger.if you want a daily driver and if you dont game that much then go for it. if you want a budget gaming phone then check realme c series.

"
"

   Hello Sir, We are buying a phone from amazon and it delivered on 10th sept,2020 and return timeline complete on 17th Sept, 2020 and today i found a problem like attached photo and videos. we are used this phone in my hand and  accidently stop working. I hope please replace the product as soon as possible.

"
"

  Excellent phone in budget segment... Camera quality is good.. Battery life 52 hours and 528 hour standby.. No lag.. Good performance.. You can use Google lence without any app.. Good quality.. Dual volte and VOwifi support.. I loved it also thanks to Amazon for fast delivery.. Miui 12 update has arrived in this phone. The phone you should buy in this time..

"
"

  I am writing the review after 20 day use. This phone have no finger print sensor. But battery life is ok. Camera quality also good. Selfi camera not so good but budget wise it's a good phone. Everything is very good in this range.

"
"

  A mid-range phone with every necessary features. The design of the phone is superb. An all day use phone and you don't need to exercise regularly with charging your phone. The audio quality and mic works at par. However, if you are looking for a camera phone it may not reach upto your expectations. It's an ideal handset to gift it to your parents.

"
"

  As expected an Mi product of topnotch quality. Unmatched configuration and features at the price. Best value for money. MAde in India.

"
"

  I bought this product for my grandmother. She doesn't need high end configuration. It has been 15 days or so and she is very happy with it. Battery life is really good and phone is decent looking. Easy to work with. Nice for day to day simple usage. Cannot comment on heavy duty usage as my grandmother doesn't need it.

"
"

  Don't have finger print sensor. Battery life is good in new condition butI have listened that battery life will be degraded after use of some months.Also one bad thing is the poor quality of pictures taken by rear camera instead of having dual rear camera. Pictures taken by rear camera is too dark in quality.

"
"

  So i bought this phone on 5th march 2020 for my mother. It went smooth because anyway she doesnt use phone apart from call and whatsapp. Now since 2 days the phone is not starting. It hanged first, when i she switched off phone to restart and again tried to start, it failed.its been 2 days the phone is dead. Its hardly 2 months. Highly disappointed. Poor quality of product.

"
"

  This mobile is nice but there is a problem in it when I call someone it couldn't call then I have to reboot it and then it works I have to reboot it at least three times in a day . It's the major problem in it but the camera and battery life are superb. There should also be a fingerprint scanner. I give the mobile three stars from five stars .

"
"

  Great mobile at this price rangeAmazing look.. Love the sea blue colour.. Good Battery Life and Good Camera Quality.. It doesn't have a fingerprint reader but Face Recognition is available

"
"

  I ordered a 2 GB RAM version earlier for one of my family member that worked fine. But this 3 GB RAM version started giving problems after 2 weeks of use. The screen often starts blinking and the phone has to be restarted again and again. The return window was closed. I think this is pathetic phone. Don’t buy it.

"
"

  I didn't find a finger print reader in this phone it was strange for me , the battery life is good , camera quality is ohk ohk , the phone have a face reader for unlocking the phone , I didn't tested it till now I would update the review after testing it , but it's good for normal use ..

"
"

  After using this about 6 month. I got this for 6500.Its really worth it in this range. Except camera every thing is upto mark.Battery backup is awesome.Paisa Wasool.

"
"

  the looks from the front is as same as redmi note 8 u’ll not find any difference, battery life is fantastic, audio quality is also good overall good smart phone and in this price point u won’t get the phone like this.Bit first let i thank and appreciate the Amazon, by sending this phone within no time and in good packaging

"
"

  Dont go buy the review of other if you spend 7.5k on a phone and you expect a performance of a flagship phone than its your problem.. This is a decent smartphone works flawlessly.. Camera is ok ok not that great but overall I didnt feel any lag ot any problem till now its been more than a month... Recommended👍👍

"
"

  Very good phone this price and very good specification and features this price...But fingerprint sensor not......

"
"

  Phone battery is not charging. I kept the phone for charging like crazy,,, but it's not working. Even if I charge for hours, it'll be having just 20%-30% charge. I really need a replacement. Please someone help me. It's been just 20 days I ordered this and return data also crossed. I am so much disappointed with the product and return policy of this device. Someone help me...

"
"

  This phone is one of best entry level  smartphone under 10k with some valuable features like type c port with fast charging, Gorila glass 5 protection and Snapdragon processor better then P22/P25/A25 of mediateak .....

"
"

  Just waste of money. Worse experience with Amqzon ever. Display is shaking automatically after few minutes of using. Worst thing is that it charged 27% only after long 14 hours. I foumd no fingerprint whereas it's asking to review fingerprint.

"
"

  Its good in this price range and my cousins were using this from 2years,yet times it become slow but restart helps to fix things.

"
"

  First of all its chinese phone but manufactured in india and we indians have no option when we are choosing any phone below 10k so I found this redmi 8A phone. Phone quality is superb with 3 gb ram and 32 gb internal storage with Microsoft sd card and AI camera is awesome. no hang just use it and go for it.

"
"

  Good Phone at this Budget. Sound is clear and loud. Camera quality good at day time. 5000 MaH battery is better than other phone, may operate for whole day with good usage.Except for the chinese apps and update, not sure, it would update or not.

"
"

  After approx 15-20 days of use... It's screen start getting freeze and sudden shutdown unable to access anything further...When contacted to customer care... They just keep it for 7 days amd replaca as it is...It is still giving problem while using yet customer care doesn't replace or help with anything.

"
"

  The mobile was really good at this price.There is no fingerprint reader,camera quality is ok and the battery was awesome.It stays for a long.Budget friendly  mobile.It is not fit for gaming and it is a better choice for online class.Hope this review helps you:)

"
"

  (1) I guess camera used to be better in the earlier Redmi phones.(2) The buttons on the side (volume, power) gets accidentally pressed often. Sometimes fast boot opens.(3) Phone doesn't feel very safe to hold. I constantly feel like I'll drop it. Perhaps it's due to size.

"
"

  Within 3 months of purchase the phone crashes and hangs a lot . It’s used for only whatsapp and YouTube mostly. Such simple applications cause phone not responding and requires a restart . I bought this as gift to my mom who handles it so previously yet the phone is a huge let down my first redmi phone. Doubt if I will ever return Redmi. Hope some patch or fix can improve it

"
"

  3gb 32 gb : Without any heavy app. installation and even , phone get hang ,reboot is only option in such cases.Except above issue , battery, camera, sound ,design,display are pretty good in this range

"
"

  The colour of the ph is outstandingBut it's have only the outlook,Inside the phone is not satisfiedLittle bit of lag, 720 pixels regulation,☹️DisgustingOnly the battery is good but the charging time is 2.50-3 hours to get 0 to 100%Really not satisfiedBetter you can buy resmi 8a in less price but same phone

"
"

  Display is destroyed so not available this item when available

"
"

  Fantastic phone quality, great experience..First time i am using redmi and great performance at this Price..Qualcomm processor fantastic job and battery perform first class, camera also good job..And I would to true say the phone quality fantastic.

"
"

  #Desh ka Dumdar Phone by Redmi India.I suggest to you go for this. Amazing Mind-blowing Product. Also, In this phone fingerprint reader is not present. But for budget phone award goes to this under 7500rs. Superb

"
"

  Good Phone, so far working fine, in this price range you can pick this phone, has good quality camera and ram management is also fine.Best part its battery life. In normal usage may be 2 day backup

"
"

  MI phones are worst in quality. It's hanging too much even when I only have 4 simple apps. When in loud speaker mode, even speaker and Mike both seems to be not working properly only after 20 days. Phone is having heating issue & they are having worst service center as they never provide quality service.

"
"

  This is Really Amazing in this price point 😘It has recently received Android 10 update.Battery runs two  days while light usage.Camera is more than average.Long Shots are Awesome.It is enough powerful to run GTA SA, Free Fire on Ultra settings.In my opinion it should be priced around 7,000₹.

"
"

  I bought it for mom..c is newto andriod.. In this price.. Product is good.. Camera n fingerprint reader is good.. Battery depends on use.. Apps..

"
"

  I bought this phone for my dad he isn't a gamer so I tkoght 2GB RAM would be enough and yeah it's enough for daily useBattery stays for a whole day or two with full brightness YouTube streaming I don't know  about that..There wasn't a fingerprint reader that was a bummer but yeah for 7.5k it meets the requirements

"
"

  Very good mid range phone. But the camera quality is not up to the mark. Pubg and codm runs smoothly but gyroscope is not good.heats on charging like any other redmi phone.

"
"

  Awesome smartphone at this price range. Nothing beats it. Nice smooth processor for normal usage. Not for gaming though.

"
"

  Good battery backup and it gives more than 8 hours screeen ontime for one complete charge but in case you are interested in Wireless FM Radio then this is more than dispointment. Xaiomi should be sued for such wrong publicity about  wireless FM radio.

"
"

  this mobile is super everything is great battery backup camera display all is avesam and its design is very impressive I like this mobile very much in this budget is mobile is superb you should for go for it

"
"

  Picture quality is very much bad for the bad camera quality.I sugest try other option which is better then this phone.Most problematic MI stores also, every time required update.

"
"

  Nice mobile according to price, camera more than average, everything is good I am happy with this product. Only one problem at the time of incoming call, when we cover proximity sensor, screen turns off and only rings, we have to on screen from the side button, it's solution is you can on the raise to wake option. Thnx to Amazon

"
"

  I 1st time purchased mi phone & as I thought it’s exactly like that WORST PRODUCT, software issues as you can see in upload video, apps automatically start running, very irritating experienceRequest DONT WASTE MONEY TO BUY THIS PRODUCT

"
"

  Not good for long use, battery camera not up to the mark

"
"

  Its a good Budget mobile .Battery back up is good , it really is 5000mAh battery.Camera is Good but  dont expect High quality Pics .

"
"

  Goodphone

"
"

  First impression ,Good .I bought this for my mom(Amma). Detailed review soon

"
"

  Schedule power on and off and find device options are not working though I followed direction provided by mi customer care and factory data reset. There is a problem in software. Company should notice the problem and customer should notice. Thanks for the replacement initiation.

"
"

  It is lightweight and I like the look. Battery backup is nice. Camera is average. Not like dslr. 😁Processor is fast.

"
"

  Phn isntoo gud but amazon cheat me they cant give me charger.  Nd when I complained they said to self return this product

"
"

  Overall This Mobile is good.1. Bad Camera quality. Selfie camera is good.2. Good battery life3. Slow Mobile4. Back side cover quality is not good5. Better to have good quality pouchIt is suitable For normal usage people

"
"

  Very good battery back up. I watched You tube for 1.5 hours and only 10% battery consumed.Good mobile in such a cheap price.

"
"

  I will never suggest anyone to buy this phone. Now a days quality of mi phones are getting degraded. Phone is hanging a lot. Also some inbuilt feature like screen shot is not working. Not a good phone. Only plus point is battery life, which is good. But apart from that other aspects of a good phone are very poor.

"
"

  It's one of best mobile in low budget, but not good quality of camera. Good for online access, surfing. Not good for video game player.

"
"

  Excellent product ..!1) good touch quality2) HD screen3) Good camera quality4) nice design.Finally great product & affordable price.!

"
"

  I received a used device. The pin wasn't there, cardboard was broken.After switching it on, it didn't ask for my Google account. Home page ooened straight away. I cleared the data and it locked me out saying someone's MI account is already linked to it and now I'm unable to even turn on my phone

"
"

  Performance has been docile after 3 weeks of use.Battery is indeed exceptional along with several other features that make this phone distinctive in the marketplace.However camera quality could have been massively upgraded.Finger print sensor should have been present.Otherwise Okayish in the price range.

"
"

  India's most third class brand is Mi. Not satisfied with this product at all. From the very first day I faced issue. Recent app key does not work properly. Recent app areautomatically dilited. Poor camera quality. Setting is very complicating. Full of 3rd class features. The only satisfactory thing is its battery.

"
"

  Super phone with great look and battery back up. Phone pic and video quality is great.

"
"

  It's a very good product for budget price in lockdown,,battery very good, this is Speacilaty of this product,, over all this phone is very good,, I am very happy to get this product due to study purpose. Thanks to Amazon to gave cod on this product,.

"
"

  Product is good but it's not made in India .It's made in ChinaClearly written on boxIt's imported from China .

"
"

  Just after 42 days, the phone started misbehaving, from any section of mobile it is coming back to home screen automatically in less than a minute, MIUI experience is not good, faulted phone is sent by seller and Mi company, Amazon please look into this, please compensate, I am hurt

"
"

  Battery capacity given 5000maH but actually not like that, battery capacity actually proven for 3000mah. The draining speed is as same as 3000 or less mah. Overall the performance is good but in a term of battery capacity little compromised whether it's internal falut or battery problem that cannot be understand.

"
"

  I purchased 3Gb RAM Variant at rs 8500 and I think it is overpriced as it's camera, processor, screen quality is very bad.

"
"

  The screen of the Redmi 8a is pretty good under Rs 8,000 price phone.I've purchased it for my Mom🥰...She is very happy with this SURPRISE.t has a light weight,thin that you are very easily use for the daily life. 🙂But not really satisfied with the camera quality😢

"
"

  Sir product is hanging a lot from past 20 days . I reboot & updated it 5-6 times still problem continues.  Also there is no replace or warranty option given by you. Extremely disappointed from amazon service . Please solve my problem .There is something very wrong with the software of this product.

"
"

  Till date no issues, good working. I don't think there may be any problems. Good one in this range. No fingerprint reader. Camera is average.

"
"

  the phone is so much laaging .we cant play pubg ,ff  smoothly .the best thing i like  in this phone its battery performence and the back design .

"
"

  i dont why sellers took 8 days for shipping. what he was doing (preparing for refurbished?) i didnt get free basic transparent pouch in side the box. he is too late to ship the product. Apario pvt ltd

"
"

  This phone is good only very for normal user 2gb ram hang this phone sometime.but note its battery is awesome call quality is good speaker is average, design is also good not slippery camera is average, and what u get in jst 7499

"
"

  Best Phone in the price segment. Built quality, camera performance and battery backup is awesome. It's Redmi so we get everything best in affordable price.

"
"

  The phone is good but the camera quality is very poor. It has a written 13 megapixel camera, but it takes pictures like a 5 megapixel camera. No good photo can be taken at night. Overall a good phone, but not recommended for those buying for the camera..

"
"

  I have doubts regarding manufacturing and import date of product. As Date of manufacturing is June 20 and date of import is July 20 . How it's possible that phone is imported in India in July 20 which yet to be come

"
"

  I bought this phone on 3rd march. Returned on 7th march due to mal function. They sent me one more cell but im facing the sane problen. It always tell 'find device closed unexpectedly'. Due to this problem im unable to open some apps like whatsapp and youtube. Even im unable to open camera app some times.

"
"

  Best phone

"
"

  During incoming call display is not showing , we have to unlock the phone to see who is calling.we also wnet to MI center , they reported sensor is not working properly.Please don't buy this phone . Increase the buget if possible to buy other phone. my friend also bought this phone and also received defective one.

"
"

  It doesn't contains Fingerprint reader, Battery life is OK. Again We are so dissatisfied with the camera Quality. Overall this phone is not so satisfying but till it's ok to have this phone !!!

"
"

  Got the budget phone @7499 For 2 gb-32 gb , truly needed for Online Classes, I also suggest to sale at previous discounted price with more choices. Phone is nice, with clear display, Sound is good, Network connectivity is good. Basic needs fulfilled.

"
"

  I purchased it for my mother ... a really very nice product...cam quality with AI  is also good .....Battery life awesome... sound quality good...MIUI 11 supporting system....fast charging with 18 W plug....Go for it..best budget phone

"
"

  Dear everyone,Please don't purchase this phone. after 15 days of purchased, the display not working properly. Automatically many app opening and closing without touching phone. Some software issues is there. But they telling good option within the budget range. Totally waste of money...

"
"

  A budget smartphone , not expect much.Display is quite satisfactoryBattery lasts for one and a half day if you use constantly.No finger print sensorNo gravity sensorCamera is above averageLacks night escape modeCharger heats up a lot during charging

"
"

  Battery got discharged in one night. It was just kept aside without sim and wifi. Will check other features after the phone is charged.

"
"

  The mobile is only 7 days old & the processor is malfunctioning.The product could not be returned within 7 days as the return request could not be processed due to tedious policy of self check could not be materialized.Very very disappointed.

"
"

  Product and service of Amazon is good. I have purchased this mobile in Rs. 8299/- marginally Price is high.Drawbacks- Pre installed app like mi account, mi browser, mi store, mi video , mi pay, mi credit, shareMe and mi community. Which leads to unnecessary memory's cosumption.

"
"

  Nice phone at this priceProsBattery lifeGood displayGorilla glass 5 protectionSD 439 energy efficiency 12nmMIUI interfaceConsAverage cameraNo finger print censorOutdoor visibility in direct sunlightNo IR Blaster

"
"

  Bought this for my mom.  This mobile set is dazzling and has great appeal.  Such a good set at such less price!!

"
"

  It serves all my needs. Display, camera are satisfactory. Signal capturing capability is really good. Touch response time is normal. Battery life is also sufficiently good.

"
"

  The whole mobile set and its functions are very good as compared to it's price. The phone doesn't have fingerprint sensor but camera and battery life are very good. Satisfied with my purchase.

"
"

  Good product and worth ...ideal phone for only calling and whtsp ..since it has less ram and storage ... suitable for eldersAverage cameraBattery doesn't drain muchA bit slow ..not really slow!The back cover has a rough texture , better grip

"
"

  Product was working fine, with this budget got a 3GB RAM,32GB storage mobile and Camera pixels also more as compare to competitors products,It’s simply worthy. And Good product.

"
"

  This product is exalent. Mi 8a dual phone is very intalegent mobile, superb quality. Mi is company quality first rank really great technology, with dolby, dts sound in ear phones. Thank you amazon, ilke phone, one million ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐,,,,,.....

"
"

  This is the best mobile I've ever bought. One thing that i like about it is... It never hangs and processor is damn fast mtlb amazing😍.  But the one thing only i dislike about this device is the design.... When it comes to its design its a Lil bit odd. But overall this phone is amazing.

"
"

  Dislikes: not two day battery, screen resolution Dotty, MI apps useless and can't be uninstalled.Likes: best option below 10k, better than Samsung, satisfactory ownership.

"
"

  Not expected this quality from MI, only after 7 weeks of using its sound speaker is not functioning, mobile also hangs frequently, also getting hot during long calls, worst quality got.As a true customer, If possible, request MI to change the mobile with new one.

"
"

  Budget mobile.....Worthy for money....Little bit disappointed by the processor ....Could have been upgraded but speed is very good for normal user rather than gamers......Especially battery is tooooo goooood .......Type C charger is an advantage..With 18w charger

"
"

  Ear Speaker noise is very less as compaired to Redmi 6A always need to use on speaker. Unable to heard properly so creating miss understanding. Good product in this Price. Battery life good but need to also improve. Selfies camera is awesome.. As compaired to other same specifications this is very good👍👍

"
"

  Good quality. Finger print sensor not yet used. Battery and camera are good. Pre-installed apps are a problem

  I would rate this product ZERO.. pls do not buy this product waste of money..After inserting the sim the phone is always switched off.  Due to this had got the SIM also changed but the issue of the phone continues.. same sim works on other phone perfectly fine.

"

  Budget phone under 10000 and specs are quite impressive but when it comes to camera it's almost similar to redmi 7a...and battery life is okay-okay...fast charging support with type-c charger...face unlock okay-okay...performance amazing...attractive look(sky white)..₹8299 is worth it..

"
"

  It's a amazing phone📱. It's battery has a great power which is long lasts. And fast charging is also super duper. There's no fingerprint reader but other securities performs there best. It's camera quality is good and best selfie it's auto focusing is fantastic. Loving it

"

  Battery - 10 marksCamera - 7½ marks.(In this budget price it's worth but the image can be more brighter)Performance - 8 marks. Has good dual 4G speed and shows no lags while playing games.Overall - 8 marks

"
"

  Don't know, but I ordered this phone and returned it.Received new piece again.But same issue with this phone as well , microphone issue,Not able to hear voice of person who is on the other side.Now going to return this phone and will purchase other phone but not Redmi 8a

"
"

   After 9 day phone display is flickering. When I called to customer care, they simply told me we can't help you, your return window is closed. No support received from Amazon.

"
"

  A good phone in this price range. Back camera got good quality. Front camera is little bit low quality.

"
"

  Backcolur is White & its awesome, camera is as always average for redmi products but processor is good compared to same range realme mobile.

"

   Very bad quality. Speaker and mic  Very bad quality. Speaker and micVery bad quality. Speaker and micVery bad quality. Speaker and micVery bad quality. Speaker and micVery bad quality. Speaker and micVery bad quality. Speaker and mic

  Nice product by Redmi. A budget smartphone for everyone. Nice battery backup. Nice design. And Amazon service is also very good, delivery agent is very polite. Overall a good experience with Amazon Service. I hope Amazon will provide this flexible service everytime and to everyone.

"
"

  Looking great product 👌.I am looking back cover but hasn't in.selfi camera looking great.packing is good... delivery is well...it has 20 gb storage with phones applications... Snapdragon 439 good processors in the mid range....8300rs...thank you amazon....

"
"

  Hanging, screen not working properly. Didn't work any swhich at time of hanging.very bad feedback from my side.

"
"

  Good phone. Bit bulky may be because of big battery. Awesome back camera, average front camera. No lagging. Overall good budget phone. Ideal for elderly people.

"
"

  Pretty bad performance. Battery drains out in few hours (max 4 hrs) camera quality is not great could have gone for other brands with the same range.

"
"

  Basically A phone for Basic Usage.. If u are a Gaming person don't go for this one but if u hv to give it to ur parents or u urself has limited usage u can give this phone a shot.Totally worth it.Value for money phone.

"
"

  After using for 1 week, I am writing this review the fon is awesome, the battery is good and the camera is also good, mostly it is good fon for the parents.

   5 दिन में Redmi 8A dual का touch खराब हो गया । शिकायत पर कोई रेस्पॉन्स नहीं।मेरे खराब अनुभव के आधार पर redmi का कोई फ़ोन नही खरीदे। 0 स्टार

"
"

  Older text messages goes up. This phone has a limited memory for text messages. It approx saves 100 messages per number. Beyond a certain limit, older messsages diasppear. If I knew this, I never buy this phone.

"
"

  The phone was fine but the charger was not workingIt is a faulty charger. i thought the phone was fine but with a new charger too, charging is not happening. I realised too late that the piece is a bad one.The changing port of the phone is itself faultyIt is a diffective peice

"
"

  Though Phone battery is great , the internal storage is wasted by installing too many un necessary apps. the worst part is that the in built antenna stooped working within few days of purchase and now has to use head phones for FM receiption.

"
"

  Good one. Had ordered for my dad and he seems at ease using the same. Appearance, colour, display, battery are all fine so far

"
"

  2gb ram gets phone slow.

"
"

  Low in price, big screen, good for normal use. People who have low budget, this is very nice. Also got it on emi, it also went smooth.

"
"

  No fingerprint sensor, normal charging speed, camera not bad, pubg play with gfx tool in extreme setting smoothly but gyro repond veey slow (not work properly).This phone made only normal usage.

"
"

  Overall performance of the phone is good, The battery when compared to other phones in same price range is weak , camera is pathetic, display is not bad ..

"
"

  Excellent phone at competitive price. Great value for money. People looking for low budget phone with comparable features of high end, can blindly opt for this phone and make it ranking no. 1 in mobiles

"
"

  I regret buying this after I got to know that I could have bought note 6 pro at slightly higher price, which is better phone then this one :(

"
"

  I gave this phone as a gift to my Sister and she loved the phone. The charger received along with the phone was faulty and did not charge, I called up Amazon however the entire product had to be returned and was also out of stock, there was no option to retutn the charger and hence I did not return it.

"
"

   Defective piece delivered and now not replacing it.because problem had seen in mobile after 10  days of deliverybso now they are not replacing it... Very bad service.. Not satisfied at all

"
"

  Damdar product at this price range. Battery is very good last long front camera is awesome, back panel and its colour looks very cool. Overall very best phone at this price range just go for it

"
"

  Liked display and notch area. Gives feeling of large screen. Happy about battery too. Cam is descent but could have been better for this price range.

"
"

  Battery life 3 days.smooth display. Classic look. fast charge. Good camera.average performence. 7500 price. Low padjet High range mopile

"
"

  Redmi 8a average budget friendly phone...i bought 2 redmi 8a dual.i felt some issues on automatic brightness .Normally it will be work under the light conditions but when i put it on,suddenly the brightness getting low then it will never back to normal light..both devices have same pblm..

"
"

  Good phone in this price range . Can’t expect much from the phone as it is sufficiently loaded.

"
"

  in this price range this is best smartphone for basic use.Its runs PUBG also on low settings but basically its not made for gaming purposes.This is best non gamer user like me who used only phones for calling and normal streaming purposes.And speaker of this phone is quite loud also.I likes this phone.

"
"

  A very good mobile, camera is not good,But performance is good,Recommended for day to day work

"
"

  I bought this phone for my momThe smartphone comes with a 5000 mAH battery. Large screen good camera.

"
"

  Overall a good phone with quite interesting specifications but not for youth they need more powerful processor and other specifications

"
"

  Good mobile at this price I mean it's such a budget friendly phone. And it's battery backup is great.

"
"

  Finger print sensor not available

"
"

  Thank you amazon.time to time delivery super.packaging is excellent.redmi note 8Adual.3gb,64gb mobile is super.

"
"

  Amazing product at this range i don't have to say battery backup is amazing and cameras just do what they are suppose to do, don't expect much from them, overall quality is amazing i love it.

"
"

  Faulty Product - The charger is faulty and the phone does not charge at all. Unfortunately I got the product during the start of lockdown and now I’m stuck with a faulty product without option of being able to return! Extremely unhappy and feel cheated !

"
"

  Good phone in budget price. Need to improve camera quality. Especially front camera needs improvement. Can give silicone cover atleast and charging can be improved fast front

"
"

  I just bought 2 days back..phone is ok  . But they have sent corrupt charger which is not working at all.. please replace it ...it never get charges more than 2 %... or refund my money  .Amazon  should take care of the products before delivering it . We can't wander to courier office often n often.

"
"

  The product was of very bad quality. Tried to connect Amazon on call, but due to lockdown, it was not possible. When I was connected, I told them that volume button is not working, they said try after restarting the phone. That problem still persist and every time I have to restart the phone to operate volume button.

"
"

  This phone gives you a lot of features which doesn't come in other brands in the same price range. Battery is good, camera is okay and fingerprints works just fine. If you have low budget you can go for this phone.

"
"

  Redmi 8A Dual I bought this mobile some months ago & after using this I can bet this is the best mobile phone in such a cheap price...Battery life is good Camera quality is ok ok but only Fingerprint is not in this phone otherwise good for working people.

"
"

  Camera: The camera quality is not good when considered for portrait shoot. Images are not sharp, you will find the camera to be tiny and not a great build.Body build quality: Worth the moneyRAM: Okay, as its not a gaming mobileAI face unlock: Good

"
"

  This is made in China. Imported in 07/2020. Beware.

"
"

  Top class 👌spec's in it's price.well design 🤟by Xiaomi . Value for money.Most of the people who have buy a new phone in this price range they have one thing in the mind that's value for money. And it is that. 🙏Excellent 👍 service by Amazon .

"
"

  Basically  this phone is bought for my mom and she loves it .She is happy what is product  offer to her .But there is only issue with finger print sensor which is not given .

"
"

  Ok ok ,not soo  better go for samsung ...Nothing about this product 3.8 ratingopen light camera  is good 5 ratingBut inside house camera 2.5U decide

"
"

  The Screen starts flickering after use of a Month! Without any rough use of the Phone! Will suggest don’t do for this Phone Rather u can get better of it with MI itself! Such a fault in Screen not tolerable.

"
"

  Worst product. It's feel like brick in hand.. so heavy . Phone hangs a lot and heating issues are there. OS is not fast and remember it produces lot of radiation ... don't go for it.

"
"

  The product seemed to be excellent for one month but then began to restart frequently, redmi customer care executive suggested to visit service centre, unable to visit service centre during lockdown. Pathetic experience for the first time from Amazon.

"
"

  There is no warranty card inside the boxNo ear phones connector tooAnd these days a screen guard and a transparent case are given to customers but in amazon theres nothing

"
"

  It get hang up within 2 week. After rebooting by calling customer care it's running ok but risk remains

"
"

  Review after 3 month useNice phone in this rangeGood cameraGood batteryFeel very good and nice look

"
"

  Dislike  :  Not head phone available with this packing.Like  : we like RedmiUse  : for my daughter.

"
"

  Looks very cheap. you can buy an advanced/better mobile by adding two-three thousand to your budget.

"
"

  it's a good product. face sensor is work very good.  it's camera battery life and over all performance is the fantastic with its price. i am so happy with mobile . back cover is not given with  mobile.

"
"

  In my set I am suffering from lost of network, I don't know why this occurs. SIM is tested on other mobile instrument no problem of network. In this set spoken to various times on customer care all test done as per there instructions but all in vein. Kindly help.

"
"

   This phone is worst......the screen start flickering after three to four days of use.

"
"

  Phone worked fine for 10 days but now m facing problems. Apps getting crashed, Opened my  contacts, Screen was automatically running.  when i called someone, screen goes turned off and did not turned on even after pressing power button multiple times.

"
"

  This phone is great from every aspect.I bought this phone for my mom.She was amazed to see the battery backup this phone has.Camera is good too for the price.If you're buying this phone for your mom or dad, then it's a great buy.

"
"

  The product is delivered in good condition.I am satisfied with the packagingI bought this smartphone for old person who only needs it for primary use such as camera whatsApp and calling purpose. Whosoever is buying this for basic purpose can definitely go with this product.

  I free of cost taken this phone for I show my friends in WhatsApp & facebook this phone a budget phone and full specification and more sell for samsung smartphones.

"
"

  Its not working. Pls don't buy this phone. Listen carefully, Only on August 14th 2020 I bought this, but today 23.08.2020 its not working. I couldn't even switch this mobile on. Samsung Galaxy M01 mobile. Mobile is not worth. As today I came to amazon for return or replacement this cheater has closed the return window by yesterday. How cunning they are ? not even ten days its been since I have bought. This cheaters have closed it. Its not working now.  Even if I call toll free numbers no one responses.

"
"

  The phone suddenly went completely dead within 10 minutes of switching it on after receiving it. Asked for a return, but the delivery boy didn't take the return because the phone is dead! Again request a return. Waiting to see what happens now. Can not take it to any shop or dealer as it is purchased online.

"
"

  After using 4/5 days suddenly without notice, the phone shutdown automatically and I couldn't restart it. So contact with amazon for replacing it and get very quick response from their end and they book a time slot to verify it by a technician. But after few hours later I found in start up guide send by Samsung,  how to restart when it stops working or hanged( by pressing power and volume key simultaneously for seven seconds or more). The fault is from the end of Samsung company I suppose, because they should mention the process on the front page with bold letter. Most of the reviews which get 1 star facing the same problems like of mine.  After using one month I want to add some extra points which impressed me.1. Sound quality and graphics are very good.2. Smooth touch sensitivity3. Ringtones are much louder.4.Two volte nano SIM s work fine together.5.Battery backup is good. Charging time is not so lengthy.6.Any SIM can be switched off manually, that impressed me.7. 2GB ram and 32 GB storage is better option for budget friendly people.8. I faced hanging problem for one day only till now , which can be easily solved by pressing volume down key and power key simultaneously for 7 seconds or more.8. Lastly this mobile is Made in India which I like the most.  So any one can go for it. Amazon agents are really helpful which I experienced.

  Thanks Amazon for delivering the product as mentioned in the product description. It was well packed and delivered.By the way, A Special Thanks to SAMSUNG for stepping up to INDIA's needs and introducing a new Line of Phones for taking on the Chinese Incursions in Indian Mobile Phone Market.We ordered ""Samsung Galaxy M01 Core (Blue, 2GB RAM, 32GB Storage)"" and thrown away the chinese phone Salomi as it had 100 other Apps Pre-Installed without our information and heating phone and draining battery. Had a tough times using that 'Salomi' phone. Now with a GOOD / BETTER Phone from GOOD Company Samsung, happy to own this ""Little Cute Phone"".Samsung Galaxy M01 Core (Blue, 2GB RAM, 32GB Storage) -- is a small enough to keep in pockets and has all the Latest Android 10 OS with a Good Display.  -- All latest version of Apps in a lite mode which means what we need only will be loaded and given instead of ""loading all forever"" and wasting our Precious Data.-- A good Camera with Samsung Reliability is known for its Crisp Camera and Displays.What else needed in a phone. Thanks SAMSUNG for bringing a new Affordable Range with Latest Android 10 OS.Way to go SAMSUNG. Surely we INDIANS will support SAMSUNG and make it to No.1 Company by replacing the Chinese Mobile Companies in INDIA.

  Not bad....can suggest this mbl for normal users.... charging speed is very much disappointed , taking lot of time to charge up ....basic charger type not even USB cable....this suits for parents only ....not for youngsters, gamers etc.

"
"

  I am writing this review after the usage of 15 days. It is one of the worst phones Samsung has made with multiple issues. Me and my friend both purchased the same phone for our aunts and are facing the same issues. The main issue I am facing is that the phone switched off 2 days back and since then I am trying to switch it on but its leading me nowhere. Neither it is charging. Phone heats up while charging as well as in normal usage conditions. While charging the phone heats up to an extent that one may feel that it could blast. My friend also faced the phone off issue but it was resolved automatically after 2 days when he connected a fast carger to the phone. He is too facing the heating issue. His phone still switches off on its own again and again now and then... All we both are able to do is to regret on wastage of our money.

"
"

  I have recieved this phone on 14th of August 2020 and today is 24th of August 2020.So After 10 Days i am reviewing this phone because i have seen many negative reviews on amazon review portal so now my true experience is about this phone following.1:- Processor Media tek Quad core Is best because quad core take less power from battry than the octa core processor. and i purchased this phone for my mom so quad core porcessor is sufficient to my mom.2:- Battry life is good because of Quad Core Processor.3:- Ram is 2Gb that is also sufficient4:- Display as always awesome as samsung provide.5:- Mike and Speaker's quality is too good as always samsung provide.6:- Many People said in the review that the mobile is automatically swiched off and on automatically. yes i have seen this my own only one time. but its not the problem. every new phone have done this one time because of system works smoothly. and after one time switch off on things happen then never repeated till my 10 days of use this phone. so you people who is taking switch off on problem very seriously ,you should not. this is one time process when phone is new sometimes phone may swich off and on automatically. so dont panik at all for this.7:- most of the people want to replace the phone because of one time switch off on problem then i have to say one thing that your first phone is the only phone who is brand new and the replaced phone never be a new phone at all . so never replace your new phone. this is my own experience.8:- I am fully satisfied from this phone in this price of 6499.9:-This is all the reason that is why i am giving 5 star this phone.Thank U Samsung.

  Poor Quality. Phone is not functional after 2 days of use. I bought it as a spare phone and didn't use much or neither downloaded any big apps. Phone is not getting on. It has happened under 7 days of delivery and I made a return on Amazon but it's not showing any confirmation or clarity. Waste of money.

"
"

  Product is good in that budgetAnd performance is excellent

"
"

  The bad part of this mobile was that it lasted only half day. Next morning it did not work even after charging and trying everything possible, but what's WORST IS AMAZON RETURN PROCESS. Highly disappointed with Amazon process it took me approx 4 days and 2 hours of phone calls to get the defective product returned.

"
"

  #Very poor camera.#Battery ok but slow charging.#I got this in exchange for 3.8k ,  So , I am satisfied.# M10 was far far better.#gaming ok#worst part is camera.dont expect any nice  pics.#small screen so easy to handle.#overall 3.9star I'll give,coz you own samsung at such cost.# may be bigger M01 is better.

"
"

  Major issue with this phone is slow charging and quick battery draining. Look of handset is sleek and smart but charer is Normal(Non-USB). To connect with other devices like laptop, PC, you will need to purchase extra USB cable. Backside of phone get heated if using for long time like an hour or more. I was recording video on 14.08.2020 and in 15-20 minutes, phone get overheated and I stopped video recording.

  Update 16 Oct 20Samsung service is trying to push manufacturing defects as my fault. They are playing with small users. Please be careful buying any Samsung product as they are operating like a fly-by-night company.I've already spent Rs. 3,000 for a Rs. 6,000 phone without a working phone for the last 1 month.Update on 29 Sep 20.Reducing status to 1 star.The phone is increasingly giving problems.a) The screen responsiveness is getting worse.b)  The SD card is always giving error.c) Taking lots of time to load Apps.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I exchanged my Samsung On5 for Samsung M01 Core mainly because of the lack of internal memory. Good sturdy experience of On5 let me to buy this phone. I have no complaints about the hardware though many of the software have regressed from On5. Let me write them down:1. Samsung On5 running on Android 6 was more stable than current Android 10. It has rebooted atleast twice on it's own.2. Camera has no panorama and other mode which was there in On5.3. Chrome hanged twice during this period.4. SD card stopped reading once. Had to push it back again to work. Never happened in On5.5. Do Not Disturb can't be customized. Samsung On5 had it.6. Unread SMS not highlighted.Go version shouldn't mean regression. I'll be happy to discuss with the architects who would want genuine op

"

  I wud have given no star but unfortunately there's no such option. The mobile stops reading the sim card often on the second day of use. When tried to replace the item quoting defective product, they ask me to install an app to solve the problem and the app itself doesn't work. IT SUCKS. My money got wasted.

"
"

  It has all the basic features and the interface is quite smooth. It has support to wi-fi calling also. Overall the phone is good value for the money spent on it.

"

  Samsung is loting money by giving worst product I am using this phone after one month it started and stop working saying overheating if I watch movie for half an hour of video call for half an hour

"
"

  It's really value for money 💰🙂...The phone comes with a 5.30-inch touchscreen display with a resolution of 720x1480 pixels and an aspect ratio of 18.5:9. Samsung Galaxy M01 Core is powered by a 1.5GHz quad-core MediaTek MT6739 processor. It comes with 1GB of RAM. The Samsung Galaxy M01 Core runs Android Go Edition and is powered by a 3000mAh battery.As far as the cameras are concerned, the Samsung Galaxy M01 Core on the rear packs 8-megapixel camera. The rear camera setup has autofocus. It sports a 5-megapixel camera on the front for selfies.

  Too much lagging as like there is only 250 MB RAM.Disappointed with the slowness of the device (I have already updated the software to latest version).

"
"

  Nice product

"
"

  The battery 🔋 is totally worst and touch is very bad charging is also not proper.

"
"

  Samsung didn't meet my expectations this time. I had been a big fan of Samsung products and this product of theirs disappointed me. Battery gets hot while watching videos, playing games and when connected to the net. Battery drains fast. Not suitable for video calls. Although I bought a 2GB RAM version, video and voice keeps cutting in and out. Tried different networks. No earphones. Cheap looking charger. Samsung should not compromise on quality. If they cannot afford to release a budget phone, they should not. Instead, continue with their mid and high range phones.

"
"

  since day one sim slot is not properly working, some times it is showing ""insert sim"" error. Then again i have to restart the phone or reinsert the sim to connect the phone. I changed the sim card, then also same problem is continuing and it is clear that there is problem in sim slot. hence pl arrange to replace the phone at the earliest.

   I recieved this  item on 9this August, it was working fine. But just after 9 days, this  phone not  charging.  I  try  with  two  other charger. The  phone also  get  discharged. It is not  going  on. Also  if it is put for  charging,  the  charging icon  not on and  this phone  not  charging.

"
"

  It's a 2GB phone, you can't expect much, even Facebook lags while going through lots of browsing. The camera is Ok. The build is not good, you must use a rubber cover and temper protection. It has a 3000mah battery that's why discharges quickly and doesn't support fast charging which creates more problems. Overall what you can expect at such a cost?Analyze your needs before purchasing it. The phone is decent for household usage with few apps, but if you want to have multiple apps then don't go for it..

"
"

  Gr8 phone at the price of 6,500 from Samsung. As of now everything looks fine.

"
"

  The mobile contains  poor battery quality. 80% of charge has been drained in 3 hours with average use. Do not buy it to waste your money.Amazon will mention to return or replace product within 7 days, at the time of purchase .But in actual they will delay unnecessarily and will pass the time frame , by different protocols, as nobody can return it . Even if it is  a faulty set and there is a chance to return it.

"
"

  Everything is good as per phone price but only one thing I don’t like in this phone that is when u continues use it for 25-30 minutes it start getting heat which is not good

"
"

  This mobile is giving very poor quality of audio with breaking voice in zoom video call. I applied for return policy, but they did not accepting for return. I was shocked due to this kind of behaviour from Amazon. I will put a case through online , if they will not take return.

"
"

  Not a good phone, waste of money

"
"

  First time in life I dared to purchase a phone from Amazon. First time a Samsung phone I bought stopped working went dead within a few hours.  Later Amazon agents kept on visiting but deny to pick up the product saying it is dead.. 4 times. I kept on calling customer care in 6 or 7 calls the phone is not picked up by return agent in 15 days. Money is with Amazon. Which means Amazon is using the money. Not sure how many escalations i have to make replace the productThe product might be good but buying it from Amazon iz a pain.If you are unlucky and phone is dead you will keep begging for return. Your money will be stuck with Amazon.WORST way Amazon India treats the Customer. Better use Amazon not cheap products

"
"

  Good product.Works well and looks stylish. Ideal for thousands of people who use the internet and call features intelligently. It's non-Chinese so adds to patriotism .Very economical and absolutely value for money.Excellent service by Amazon too! Highly recommended!

"
"

  I ignored the negative reviews, especially those about receiving phones that would not turn on.  I paid the price for it.  I received a phone that never turned on- defective.  But, then the worst part was yet to come.  The wait for an inspection.  Then, the worst bit about waiting a few weeks for amazon to pick the package back.  I understand that amazon did its best in these circumstances in the COVID scenario.  I would strongly suggest that this model could be best avoided.  Samsung should seriously consider withdrawing models such as these which are a shame.

"
"

  Touch screen not working from first day of use. I requested for replace the mobile after few days delivery boy says Amazon app should have the Amazon app, the problem is I can't install the app without screen function. Still waiting Amazon to solve the problem

"
"

  Not worth 5000/- at all but perfectly worth 2800/- if ever available at this price point... LoLBasic feature handheld. Nothing much to sport or brag about. Basic functions. Smooth body and surface. Screen brightness that blinds. Crisp camera for a budget phone. All else, simply rubbish! Let your maidservant or kid play around with it instead. Haha!

"
"

  Excellent phone in low budget.Light weight phone .Good phone for old age people

"
"

  Good handset of Samsung under budget , as battery mAh is 3000 gives normal performance depends upon usage and takes time to charge too . As I bought it for my dad and it's good for elders as its comfy for use !!

"
"

  Definitely Samsung is a very good brand and we can blindly do faith on it.Phone is really good.Build quality is very good and battery life is awesome.Camera is just average bcoz we can't expect bery high quality in this price range.Sound quality is also average.Overall it is really a good deal in this price range but if we compare it with MI in this range. The. MI definitely has a lead over it.Redmi 8a dual is best substitute to this phone.

"
"

  I used may types of android mobiles I purchased this mobile for my Mother and also to test how Android GO works.Things I Like in this device:-1. Camera - When I see the feature of 8MP Primary Camera, I thought that cameras may be average in this device.  But, in real the camera clarity was awesome at the price I real didn't expect this Samsung surprised  me. Even the Front 5MP camera also chapters clear pictures.  Rear Camera has dedicated flash and surprisingly Front Camera has Screen Flash(Good See this).***Camera samples - Cell Tower, Charger and Spectacles were captured with Samsung M01 Core. Other Pictures were captured by Some other devices.2. Display - Many companies who were selling the devices at 10k even above range are still providing HD+ (720P)  screen. But, I really felt happy that we are getting excellent display with good viewing angles at 5-6k.  But, we need to note that it is TFT display, not IPS display.3. Design - Samsung is providing mate texture finish at the back, Ofcourse it is made of cheap plastic it will  definitely protect the devices from scratches.4. Operating System - This device comes with Android GO which is the lite version of Android. But, it comes with  latest  Android 10 out of the box. And Android will provided updates regularly. I bought  2GB RAM variant and installed may apps(Not much larger apps, but some general purpose  apps) I didn't find any lagging issues while using them.5. Battery - This Device comes with 3000mah battery, but I noticed that Samsung mentioned that this was  typically, which means 3000mah was not the exact rating. But, still it's ok to have that capacity in this  device. As Android GO is the lighter version it almost consumes very less battery. You watch 4-5 hours  of YouTube videos with single charge. So definitely it is more at the price.Think I didn't like:-1. Very low charger rating - Out of the box it comes with 5V - 0.7A charger (3.5W) which is very slow to charger  3000mah battery. It takes 3+ hours to full charger the device. I have 10W fast charger  with me I tried to charger with that, I was charging up but still taking 3+ hours to  charge it. So, it won't accept fast charge. As a costumer we expect at least 10W  charger at the price.2. No Face Unlock - Face Unlock feature is very common in every device now. But, this feature was missing. They  are providing PIN, PATTERN and PASSWORD options to secure your device.3. Price - Actually, this is my bad luck. when I placed the order the price of the product is 6,499/- and I paid the  full amount online. It takes 2days to reach it to me, when I received the order the product price went  down to 5,999/-.

  the best thing is it is android 10.then 1 gb ram ok but  if 2gb ram then very goodstorage is very goodcamera okdisplay size if it would5.5 inch so very good but its 5.3it is not ips lcd display it is hd+ tft displaybattery also ok for normal usageeverything is good in its price

  True Reviews,Worst phone in the world. Don’t see the YouTube reviews and buy this phone they are just lying. I wanted to give it less than one star but there was no option. I looks good in photos but is very very small phone. It lags and sticks a lot even in 2GB ram. A never buy product. Camera is freakin’ waste. They say it has 12MP camera but actually is like 2MP. The apps keep exiting themselves.And says app not responding. The WORST PHONE. Don’t buy this is my honest review. I bought it today and returned the phone on the same day it self within hours . If you wanna waste your money then invest in this phone . The packing and everything is rather soo good but phone does not function good at all.Thank You.

"
"

  Video playback as well as camera is not smooth even though it's meant to run HD videos.Tried to return the product but Amazon initiated replacement procedure by saying that particular piece is faulty, however new piece is also having same issues and I can't see replace/ return option anymore.In conclusion, the hardware is not compatible with specification. Don't go for this product and bad service from Amazon.

"
"

  So, I had purchased this set on 8/sep with much excitement but i had never expected that i have to face soo much drama for replacement / refund.phone started heating after every 2minutes use, when you visit om replacement option,  where thr actually no any replacement option , thr is option to download the app or talk to techincan , you have to explain your problem twice- thrice to them...thn they will ask you to download the app..then they will check temperature then they will arrange a techincan visit at your place , after so much of struggle. Then you will will get replacement then again same problem (may persist or maynot be)  In my case i am not satisfied with product i thought it is of Samsung brand so i cn go for it but now there is no any exchange police😔😔 but (Kamchalu type model)!!  you can invest 2k more and can go for a good model...2star...ps- such a long review but it is truthhhhhhh, now i will think twice before purchasing from amazon!!

"
"

  Product is fine but has limitations to function only in india. And it doesn't work well for my Mom cause she keeps travelling abroad frequently.Why wasn't I informed by Amazon about the restrictions that the phone can't function in other countries? There are other countries in the world too where they've been using mobile phones even before India.Misleading the customers shouldn't be the priority of Amazon

"
"

  Amazon upi, amazon scan & Pay, amazon  money  load not working on this phone  it gets version  not updated  error in play sore it shows open it called to amazon  & Samsung  customer  care but amazon says phone version  does not support  its run on anderoid lite go version so may have problem  in lite version samsung  told to visit  their service  center so dont know it will work on anderoid  10 lite go version ?

"
"

  I've been using this as my Official mobile... Apps like WhatsApp, fb lite, cricbuzz, playmusic, YouTube, Microsoft Teams, Outlook, Intelligent Hub, Hrms, Bankings apps like YONO, Paytm, gpayWith these apps it's running smoothly...A bit of lag, but for this proce range acceptable..Pros:Decent Camera at this proce rangeAverage specs at this price rangeSamsung Brand ValueAndroid Go OSSamsung skin over this OS was decentCons:Below average battery life, anyhow it lasts for a dayPathetic charging speed (more than 4hrs)Charger provided with box is 5V 1A at least 10W charger they could have added

  Phone or induction heater ?? I don't understand ..if you Use for 5 min the phone will be heating like anything,, feels like it'll blast after 10 minutes of usage... Delivered defective product ... Overheating phone ,, Unhappy with the product manufacturere, seller and also Amazon delivery service.. charger also heating like anything thing...and no inspection team has visited

  Just average phoneThis is not a negative review but trueOnly good for calling message and simple whatsapp useSlow battery chargingJust 3000 mah battery drains fast but charges slowlyOverall good value for moneyas this is only @ 5999Not so costlyNot so powerfulNot so amazingNot outstandingNot so impressiveBut overall average phoneGood for the feeling of having a smartphone but not up to the mark

  The mobile Samsung Galaxy M01 Core (Black, 1GB RAM, 16GB , received could not be charged, after battery was low.  Now new phone battery uncharged what do I do, Amazon delivered defective product. This is worst phone

"
"

  Loved this peice best phone at this price. Samsung always worth every penny. Needed phone for onliy class of my son and this is best.

"
"

  I bought this for my mother as her 1st android mobile and she is very happy with it. User friendly and good for 1st time users.

"
"

  It is not at all satisfying because it is not getting charged by any other android charger other than the given one and the process is soo slow.I literally expected something but the result was different soo please dont buy this product at all.It will never match your expectations. The normal android phone is better than this.But i am happy for few things the battery does not drain too fast and the volume is good,but we cant play animated games like pubg or free fire because it strucks in between.At last I am not satisfies with the product even the design is ordinary very normal one but It is better than in images😂 and the camera is not like they have shown. same problem if we move the phone it gets strucked.The quality of camera is not at all good but it is okay for old people and for normal users like who use it only for phone calls and messages

"
"

  Product  is best and  cheapest. I am using  this  mobile  phone,  phone  performance is very  good in this  price . Camera quality is  also  good. So totally mobile  phone is very cheapest.

"
"

  It's been only 9 day since i got the phone and it's already showing problem the phone is not charging and it's dead. The image quality is not matching what you r showing in tha detail. The display is also not good. Anywez i can bare that but the main problem is the phone is not taking charge. And it's dead

"
"

  Honestly I don't like the product. The screen response is very slow ,I can't even pick up the phone quickly. Battery life is very less and requires almost 3hrs for full charge. Overall it is very disappointing.  Only good thing is it supports android 10 that also does not have some features less. This was not expected from samsung, though it is a budget phone.

"
"

  Worst product never ever try to take this product... All of sudden stopped charging and not working after 12 days.... Need to replace this but no source to do... Please don't buy this kind of worst products when ppl are unable to spend much money... Try to take good reviews mobiles

"
"

   Purchased on 26 sep 20, This is second occassion my phone auto switched off and screen is dead. Previously it was so for 3 days, on fourth day it returned to life when tried swich repeatedly. To day the screen gone dead despite of good charge in the battery. Pl look into the matter as complaint window does not work in my panasonic eluga x.Pl help.

"
"

  Don't buy this mobile, it's totally waste.. Camera quality is too bad and battery backup also very slow it takes more than 3 hours to charge fully.. And battery was drained point by point suddenly in the normal usage also.. And heating issue also in this mobile.. Better go with any other brands in this budget..*Return procedure to get refund*In Amazon they say it's a electronic product we can't provide you a refund only we can able to provide you replacement only.. Just accept that they'll send one mobile service field agent to check whether the product is defective or not.. After they approved, they replace the old one and provide you a new one in that same product..In that replacement product also surely you'll face some defects so just ask for an refund directly through the options showing in that order page.. They immediately approve that and within few working days they'll provide you a refund..These kind of electronic product's first time they'll provide replacement offer and second time they'll provide direct refund..

"
"

  I foud it lightweight, good in appereance,Sound quality is very good, battery backup is too good , audio recording feature not found(exists or not) and phone getting heatup during youtube live streaming(may be may bedue to weak signal)Overall it is quality handset

"
"

  Note : for those whose mobile got switched off , press power and volume button at same time . It will be on in safe mode. Then you may restart or can work as it is . ...I purchased for my mother. Because it is small and lightweighted i thought it is perfect for my mom. Previously she had Redmi 7A but because i dont want to have any chinese phone in my home , i decided to exchange with this.Pros : So cute , so small , light weighted , less price , good speed ....cons: Battery , Battery , Battery... My 3 year old J7 2016 (3300Mah )(large screen than this) gave 1 and half day backup and this phone not give backup of single day . MY mother just use 3 to 4 hr daily . Then also My Mom got frustated . She even asked me to give her old phone back. Amazon was not returning this. I gave threat to go to consumer forum and after 2nd visit of technician they understood my problem and gave my money. I really go to consumer court if Amazon wouldnt have accepted my return . Its not about amount but the pain of feeling cheated daily which cause anger. After that i ordered for M21 and contrary to my expectation my mom was happy with large screen . M21 is Awesome . The Best thing about samsung phone is their UI . I love it . So if u r budget conscious then may consider other option but dont go for samsung in less than 10k phone. But I feel that samsung will improve its battery . But i request everyone to not buy chinese product.

"
"

  Bought this product for my aunt. She hardly use any of the app. only for phone calls  sometimes watz app video. Battery back up is not even coming half a day and charge time taking 2:30 hrs with the original charger given by samsung.  I bought this product just want to avoid ReadMI products. But not i am regretting that i purchased this mobile. Samsung needs to atlease match redmi phone quality which are available in this price range

"
"

  Mobile heated up after few mins of usage. Touch is not highly responsive. Mobile vibrates while playing audio in speaker at near full sound. Hangs few times. Display & call quality is good. Poor build quality. Product failed to meet satisfaction.

"
"

  I bought two phones M01 core , One is working fine(Shipped from Noida) for two weeks , need to see how long it goes, for the second one (Shipped from WB ) it gets switched off automatically , 1st time when it has 35% battery , need to wait until its battery drains completely, then it got charged and after two days switched off again at 75% charging, Requested for return.I see same complaint by many users .

"
"

  Phone become hot during charging and when on net connection. Photo cannot be used as contract picture.

"
"

  3 days i bought and am happy with the mobile very handy and fits in our hand and pocket easily no haeadset provided and battery charging takes long time got very good exchange offer

"
"

  Phone was running fine for the first few days. Then suddenly out of the blue it got switched off and gives no response what so ever. I have applied for a return. Thus, not recommended at all.P.S. will post an update on the return after the process is completed.Edit: after filing return a technician was appointed, who cancelled for no reason. Again it was rescheduled who visited and told that a lot of customers are complaining the same and yet the product is available. Anyway he diagnosed the problem as a manufactur detect. I got a replacement instead of a refund. The new phone arrived and came with the same problems. I agian filed for a return and this time got a refund. But I suppose I was lucky as I would have to run to the manufacturer of the problem would have occurred out of return window. A huge no for samsung products!

"
"

  My maid brought this for her daughter so she can use it for her online education. It won’t charge and stopped working after a month of use. Also it gets overheated. I saw positive reviews when I bought it.  Anyway it has warranty so will have to go to Samsung service Center and see.

"
"

  Got this for my dad, and writing a review after a months use. Great display and no bloatware. Go for the 32gb variant, value for money !

"
"

  Phone is very slow, It gets switched off suddenly. Made complaint to Amazon over the phone . I asked for return . They didn’t agree. Brand new phone with such issue. This is not for I paid this much amount . Please don’t buy . It is waste of money . I downloaded only one app, which is YouTube. I bought it because this is Samsung. I didn’t know Samsung make such bad quality product.

"
"

  Don't buy it from Amazon. They don't help customer and they deliver defective product. I am not able to charge the mobile, they infrom me to consult brand center for repair, as your return window had been closed. Initially I hadn't use the product for a week as I had to gift the product to someone else. So if u think to buy this buy it from samsung store, don't buy it from Amazon.

"
"

  I have received this on 16august 2020....now it's only 6th sep....my phone has become dead and is not charging up.....wasting of money....amazon should help us as this is a defective product and many people are facing same issues....

"
"

  This review is solely for the seller who sold a faulty phone with a huge black spot on the screen. It is so obvious that proper quality check was not done before delivery. This can happen only in case of a used phond being sold as new. Will have to think twice before ordering costly things online, especially in Amazon because as the eshop, Amazon also cannot deny responsibility for this. The headache that I am going through now to return the faulty item is a complete nightmare.

"
"

  Bought this mobile for kids study purpose. They just downloaded the whatsapp and google classroom. And after keeping it on charge for half an hour mobile is not starting at all. Not expect this kind of quality from Samsung.

"
"

  Waste product and process of Amazon. I bought it for a purpose n i found out after the product delivery that it doesnt meet my requirement now I'm dont have an option to return n buy a diff model also. Such a disappointing experience. Awful

"
"

  After 5 Days of usagePros1. 2 Days battery life2. Smooth performance3. Android go edition runs smooth4. Purchased 1 gb ram varient but runs very smooth no legs.Cons1. Charging time is of 3 hrs2. If u installed so many apps it will start legging (i have installed only whatsapp)I have gifted.this phone to my mother she is very happy with the performance.In this price segment this phone is superb.

"
"

  Hey guys ,don't purchase this moblie at all.it is not worthy to use, simply waste of your money.I purchased this phn for my mother.It claims to give 1 yr warranty , but the phn is dead within 1 1/2 months,Very awful product.I chatted with customer service abt whether this item can be replaced or not as it comes within warranty period ,but there is no coperative response as they keep on recycling u on same page.They don't even bother to call even after filing complaint.Simply waste product  , meant to throw in trash...I highly suggest don't buy ...

"
"

  M01 core is very light and handy...value for money...a little bit heat is there...but in this cost ..it is awesome...

"
"

  Mobile is a basic model smartphone .It wil be only suitable for calls , whatap ,youtube and some other basic apps....Phone got over heated and dead by using continuos youtube and games since it's have 1gb ram..After visiting service center phone came live again...If u r a basic user as old age people it is best one or else go for 2gb ram version

"
"

  I am very unsatisfied from this seller and Amazon.. I received a defective product.. It did not switch on. I made a replacement request. And the delivery agent insisted on checking the IMEI number from the phone. I reported the issue to Amazon but every time the agent arrived I would face the same issue. I am one of the loyal customers of Amazon and I did not expect such a behaviour from them. I hope this time it gets replaced.

"
"

  Samsung mobile ok processors is OLD in 2017 processorThse phone is old and use to very slow battery life and heating some timesDont by thsephone

"
"

  Unlike other Samsung handsets that I’ve been using for years, this phone is of a really poor quality. It heated up, the charger heated up too, and then the phone switched off and wouldn’t start. All within hours of opening the new handset. But Amazon has been wonderful with their delivery, repair and return service, so thankfully my refund has been initiated. I will not recommend this model to anyone.

"
"

  Its not the value for money. No C-type charger so charging is very very slow it takes 4-5hrs for 100% battery. Just putting 1000 bucks extra I should get Redmi which is better in this segment.

"
"

  I had purchased  this phone when there was big movement  against  chaines products.  I am facing several issues :1. Battery life not good2. Handset gets heated on nominal uses3. now after months uses phone gets switched off on few minutes talk.conclusion : don't waste your hard earned money in these political or corporate propoganda  like ban against chaines  product

"
"

  Superb for secondary usageBasic smartphone

"
"

  Battery backup, screen quality and camera quality is too poor. Didn't want to buy Chinese, so bought this expecting a good phone. But turned out to be so outdated quality that I felt like I'm living in 2015. Phones released during 2015 had better camera than this phone. Disappointing product from  Samsung when their competitors are offering much better quality phone at same or lower price.

"
"

  The phone stopped working after 15 days and when we took to Samsung repair they charged us money to get it fixed even though under warranty

"
"

  The phone doesn't switch On at all after the initial charging was done. Trying to get a replacement and guidelines by Amazon is not helpful at all. When the phone doesn't work, there is no way we can download an app. On chat with Amazon technician, they said only replacement is possible and that it will be done by 3rd October. .I had approached by 29th September and was told only replacement is possible and that it will be replaced on 3rd October which I am yet to receive. Should I next take this to consumer court??

"
"

  My younger sis using this phone since days and found it isnt a bad deal at all at this cost. Display ,touch response is great baterry life is just ok as prr her use and camera quality is better. My sis is happy to have made in india phone. Must buy phone at this price point. Cheerzz

"
"

  The phone get a switched off within a day of purchase and dont work ever after. I went for the brand name. But I feel I should have gone for MI phone instead of this. This was a gift for my mother.  Such a disappointment and embarrassment. Now Amazon is not very helpful in returning. They need picture of the phone. I think they assumed people has spare phones lying around to take photo for their defective product. Amazon please act as per your brand name at least.

"
"

  Bought this phone for my father (who used to be a feature phone user till now).. A great phone for feature-to-android phone switchers! A value for money phone. It completely satisfy all the basic requirements of a smartphone! GO FOR IT!

"
"

  Device received yesterday afternoon and it was charged to 95’%. Yesterday night it got switched off automatically and not working. Reported this to Amazon customer technical service. They have stated that no stock is available to give replacement immediately and to wait for 48 hrs. Bad experience!!!

"
"

  I buy this for my father basic use. It's nice product, you can't except more in this price. Very light weight, looks good, only I feel according to 2GB RAM it's bit slow. Rest all good. Just last I want to tell there is no Fingerprint lock, face lock, no type C charging, no fast charging. Take 4 hours to complete full charging from 10% to 100%.

"
"

  Don't buy this phone...this is the worst phone i have ever used. I have faced a issue of not charging ( Mobile got switched off and not charging ) after 3 working days. i asked to  amazon customer care  for refund....but there is no refund for this product they replaced the mobile. While using the new phone exactly after 3 days again the same problem began. Even after having the 80% of charging mobile got switched off and not started and not showing any type of indication while charging.

"
"

  For senior citizens this smart phone is sufficient, who don't want unnecessary apps, games etc.With minimal apps for banking and WhatsApp and some more apps this Samsung mobile is more than enough.

"

  nothing to dislike  good phone

  Very nice product..... I, m very happy samsungm01core. Many beautiful products at low prices. The set is very beautiful and quick.  Personally, I like it very much.❤️😍💐👌🎵

  If you are looking for a smartphone nearby 5000 Rs than this is the One, The samsung Galaxy M01 core. All the features are more than the value of smartphone itself. With 3000 mah battery you can go all day without any extra charge needed. Camera quality also awesome within this range.  Also the design of phone is stunning. Cant even imagin such a low budget smartphone with all this beautiful features. Definitely Samsung alway makes its customers happy. All samsung products are No.1

"
"

  I bought it for my Mom.Pros:- Good Hardware can withstand for years and also looking good- Pretty good camera for the price Rs.5500.- Good loudspeaker.Cons :- Charging dead slow really dead slow.- Lots of bloatware apps , i recommended you to uninstall the bloatware apps the moment you switched on the handset and if not then atleast disable the apps.- Heats a lot even for minimum usage .

  Its a good product within its price range  battery life is good can standby for 4days with minimalistic usage camera is not that clear but it serves its purpose. Though it consists of 1gb ram it never hanged for me(i never did gaming on it). Overall its a good product at 5.5k range

"
"

  After ysing it for 2 weeksPros:Camera quality is good for this price range.Screen quality is also good.4G Download & Upload speed is fine.Battery back is ok.Cons:It is Android Go version.The mobile heats up quickly after 5 mins of video chat in whats app in a good network area.The system is slow inspite of having 2 Gb Ram in Androis Go version.

  This smartphone from Samsung is really good for doin' basic task for every day use, and that's the important thing for which I bought this, it was just for RS.5999. For those who want a device just for doing simple basic task can have this. But the only disappointment for me with the device is, they could have optimized the UI just a lil' bit and the battery life is not that good, also for those who dont know this device is powered by Android 10 GO edition.

  Worst mobile ever, worst service by amazon, no return no replacement, mobile is over heated while using time, and talking time, bt amazon was not ready to replacement, they told me above 40 degree heated then only replaced, very disappointed, I promptly told u after 6 days using it's not a mobile it's a iron box dont go this,I was replaced it, bt sadly second mobile also lot of heated while calling time, n using time, worst experience wd Amazon n Samsung

"
"

  I bought it for my father.The battery life sucks.Requires 2.5 to 3 hrs to charge and a very little time to discharge,Delivered on 29 Oct 2020I tried to return the product after 2 days use , in the return option it was written eligible through 6 Oct .Then I opened the app and there was no return option available.Then I called the customer care , they said they can't do anything...The customer service is too bad ,

"
"

  If you want a good performance never buy this phone...This is not for a college going student...this phone has 3000 mah battery but it feels like it has 1900 mah battery...it takes almost 5 hours to full charge from 0 to 100% ...this mobile is best for elders like dad and mom who has basic knowledge about smartphone...i never suggest you to buy this phone...

"
"

  power button is not working, i ordered this to gift someone, poor response from amazon, tried to apply return request, unable to proceed... poor response from amazon, when i opened the box, phone was in android recovery mode due to power button issue... very much disappointed...

"
"

  Excelent phone for my father in law. I have bought this phone for my father in law as he needs phone which should be small and handy and very lightweight in hand and Major issue with this phone is slow charging and quick battery draining. and one more thing I don’t like in this phone that is when u continues use it for 25-30 minutes it start getting heat which is not good.

"
"

  An perfect phone for someone with moderate budjet and basic needs on a phone.A quality product from Samsung.Display and camera quality are good for the price range.

"
"

  Advantages of this mobile1. No blot applications2. Battery life 37 hours but battery saver mode enhanced up to 125 hours.3. We can transfer installed applications to SD cards4. We can install Candy crush type gameWe can't expect best photo from Rs. 5500-6500 range mobile camera

"
"

  It's a very nice phone in this price only the problem is of the battery it charges slowly.

"
"

  After one month of usage I cannot found any big problem. But I cannot assure anybody that it will last long eventhough I hope it will. One small disadvantage which I found was that, if you use mobile data the battery will drain somewhat quickly. Overall it is a good budget phone.

"
"

  No product support and replacement window is working. I purchased M31 and M01 phone in same week but both were defective. Not recommended Samsung to buy at all.15th September, I received this phone in packed condition an on 23rd sep, I am unable to switch on the set. I have gifted this set to my grand father. Till 22nd night, phone was working fine and on 23rd morning  I am unable to switch on.

"
"

  Unbelievably pathetic product as I ordered one and the phone kept hanging and the charging was not happening so i requested for a change of the phone and today i got a new phone delivered and the same problem is still there as its been more than one hour of charging the phone and the phone is charged by only 15 percent , i will not recommend this product even if this is a real or fake product from samaung I don’t know

"
"

  Very much dissatisfied with product.And moreover if you have still thousands of problems, Amazon will give thousands reasons to prove that they will not refund the money. They will replace everytime and you will end up getting the same product again and again.And Samsung making such products is really disheartening.From a lover of Samsung brand.

"
"

  Value for money is not up to the mark as if you pay just ₹1900 more, you can get way more features like better performance, camera, screen quality & size, battery life with the M01.But for a beginner who uses only Facebook , Whatsapp, YouTube... this would be the one.Sound is good for the price! Camera is the worst but gets the job done.

"
"

  I love it, low price. Only issue is it takes time to charge but its good for whole day with full charge.

"
"

  Worst model. Mobile dead after using for 25 minutes after full 1 charge cycle. Please don't buy this mobile, go for m01 but not this one. But, I got full refund from amazon. Good service from amazon customer care.

"
"

  I bought this phone for my wife and she finds it very compact and convenient to use. The battery has long life so frequent charging is not require. Camera quality is good for normal photography. Screen quality is really very good. You can enjoy watching  videos with amazing quality. Really value for money.

"
"

  The keyboard is very small. It has Samsung keyboard as well as Google keyboard both are too small. Even after increasing the size didn't help. Need to install third party app. The UI is the worst thing with this phone. The icon size is too small for our naked eyes to see clearly. Often i end up clicking another app while i suppose to click another. Also there is no option to increase the size

"
"

  Waste of money and timeLow qualityNo return option availableBad experience from Amazon. No proper response and return policy

"
"

  since beginning it is giving problem. In between the call message is prompted "" NO SIM"" and get disconnected. Been calling samsung but no solution to the problem. Will not recommend it to anyone.

"
"

  Amazing and affordable

"
"

  Unluckily the Samsung Galaxy M01 started overheating and went off after 5 or 6 days of working fine. But Amazon provided a Technician support and again it worked fine for next 3 days. Then episode of switching off happened again and Amazon promised another Technician support.Looking for a better closure of the issue. Will share the feedback here post completion.

"
"

  Best for daily use and not so heavy work...Quad core with 2GB ram is fine...*Not a heavy gaming device!Camera n screen resolution are best for this handset!Applications are optimized and some are of lite version... which is why device don't lag...Samsung is brand name for genuineness!Amazon deals are fabulous...!

"
"

  This phone has so many issue since the first day I bought this.It keeps getting switched off on its own and their is no support from amazon technicians as they give false output and closed the case multiple times. Totally disappointed with this product and was hoping for some better services from Samsung and amazon but seems I have to keep going to their center for its repair.

"
"

  I purchased the phone for my father. This is a budget friendly phone for sure. In my case the usage is minimum as my father is using the same. By this time I didn't find any big cons for the phone. The battery life is decent and the camera is ok. As per my experience this is a best phone for elders in the family and also to people who has a minimal usage of a smart phone.

"
"

  Quite impressive look good finishing or light weight allover goid quality with new features .

"
"

  Bought today, Phone has many issues :Performance is very slow, hanging issues, heating is another one.The screen size very small, the display is not good. Sound and cameras are the worst part of this phone.Is there anything else left on any phone? Yes, battery. I don't know about battery backup but I am sure. It will not be great.

"
"

  Very bad product. Please don't buy. Heating problem is normal. Charger also have heating problem. Wast of money.  Purchased for my mother and now wasting my time and money on this. Pethetic

"
"

  Good phone for beginners. I bought it as gift for my grandmother and she's starting to learn the android phone with this one. Nice average built phone for below moderate users.

"
"

  Waste of hard earned money. Poor service by AmazonTotally useless mobile . Poor battery performance and hangs a lot . When I called to customer care to return it they were asking to install app the phone was not even working to install it and they denied the return lost my money on totally crap product

"
"

  Phone getting Heated in all time ... batter life was worst thing ... what the specification given by amazon is not there ... i am not at all satisfied ... No Refund also available ... WASTE OF MONEY

"
"

  Battery life is less, camera clearty is normal and portait mode is absent, call hearing is not audible we have to open speaker, do not support high quality  videos, old model and less screen for usage and processor is very less and slow

"
"

  I liked it because i needed small anroid phone for calls only and net

"
"

  BATTERY LIFE GOODCAMERA QUALITY OKAY FOR SELFIESOVERALL ITS A NICE BUYBUT ITS NOT MEANT FOR APP HOARDERS OR PUBG PLAYING AS IT HEATS UP THE PHONE.FOR AVERAGE USE SUCH AS ONLINE CLASS MEETING STUDIES AND LIGHT APPS AND GAMES ITS AMONG THE BEST PURCHASES AND THIS REVIEW IS AFTER 8 DAYS OF PURCHASE OF PRODUCTIF ANY ISSUE I WILL UPDATE.

"
"

  After 1month of usage:Battery suddenly drops from 100% to 40%, heating issue while in call. I will Not recommend this phone. Just Go for midrange mobiles above 8000rs.

"
"

  Product is very bad because it has very short battery backup. Charging time is very  long. It takes longer than usual. Camera quality is very poor. Amazon service is very bad after complaint about product they didn't solve problem.

"
"

  I use this phone as basic. But this phone hang at every touch.Camera quality is clear.Value of money is also cheap.Battery don't last for full day. Without use last for 10 hrs. Using Internet last for 4hrs only.

"
"

  I am getting over heat from this mobile. Want to return but no return option was there . I have raise a complaint to technician he has give some procedure to reset . After doing the reset also experienced the same heat issue .

"
"

  After using 2 days, phone was suddenly  gone off Inspite of half battery percentage..Went to samusung  service they made it on  later again using 2 days it was again gone sudden off,First time bad experience from SAMSUNG products..Don't go for this Miseries cheap phone..It needed to be replaced as defect device manufactured.

"
"

  Bought this phone 2 weeks back. But facing a lot of problems. I was talking on the phone with 60% charge and suddenly the phone went blank and we couldn't switch it on for 2 days.Yesterday I was on call and after talking I couldn't cut the call. After trying a lot I switched it off and on againDisappointed

"
"

  The return period is over yesterday, where to contact. Then I contacted the Samsung customer care. They told to went for service center. The problem is software update. Without software update my phone not turned on. After the service person updated the software the phone got ON ed. This one is new for me, without update the phone not switch on.

"
"

  I have received the phone but didn’t work after 5 th day, didn’t start up. I believe Samsung is very good brand it should not go useless in few days. Tried to return but it’s hard process through amazon.in especially when you are out of country and ordering for parents or relatives through India account. I will not recommend anyone to buy this.

"
"

  Not sure why Phone is over heating from the first use itself. Earlier I have used 1GB ram phones. However, I feel this phone is little slow. Camera and screen quality is Good. Only issue is heating and slow.

"
"

  Yesterday  i received  my phone  by Amazon  i just stated used it today  while using  internat phone  getting  hotter... i called  Amazon  care they said download  blancoo app and can find temperature ..i fear mobile  can blast with in 7 days i will return it if problems  continue..thanks

"
"

  This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand manufactured in India.Long lasting battery life (3000mAh)Phone has 8 megapixel rear camera and has a 5 megapixel camera for selfieHandy phone with a Display size 5.3Overall worth for the money, without second taught you can go for this phone.

"
"

  This mobile is perfect for low budget buyers and also there are many interesting features which everyone absolutely like it. This mobile is price worthy.I am using this device for 2 weeks and it's running very smoothly but remember it's not for high quality games. Over all it's best mobile under Rs.10000

"
"

  Phone look is classy, battery backup a-one. camera front and back is average. there is big problem in hand set that is heating problem  while using without wifi or with wifi. that is big weakness of this phone.

"
"

  I purchased this phone but I didn't like,I talked to customer care for return but there is no any option for return,First time I got major drawback of Amazon if purchased mobile any how you have to use it either you like or not, Dump for me,Just I waste 6399 rupeese.Thanks for fast delivery...

"
"

  WORST QUALITY.WAS DEAD IN TWO WEEKS.I SUGGEST YOU SEARCH FOR BETTER CHEAPER CHINESE PRODUCTS THAN THIS SAMSUNG ENTRY LEVEL GARBAGE.

"
"

  Today I purchased Samsung M01 core easy hand comfortable ,slim nice lookBut  toch screen quality not satisfied left side top touch not working  properlyDear Samsung you please maintain your reputaion in your mobile platform because of big aduience with your side,dont lose your  single supporters from your side

"
"

  Compromises a lot on Battery, you can literally see each percentage gradually failing towards Zero! Overall a Good Package for someone looking for Basic Experience. Cameras are Good. Screen looks fabulous for the price point! Android Go version don't let you do a lot of things, and I mean it.

"
"

  Very fast  delivery from Amazon, Its Good looking phone for normal user and low price, Normal camera result and battery backup is not so good, Only one day for normal use. Overall good for routine use everyday, Don't expect much in this price. Thank you Samsung, Thank you Amazon.

"
"

  Just wow.....and I gifted to my mom ...she just loved it 😊tqq samsung❤️..not for education purpose just used to see YouTube videos and video calls for elder ones..battery life is good but camera quality is not bad but for my mom camera is not all useful ..she just watch news in phone.finally she loved it..u can buy to ur parents😊

"
"

  Bought this product on 16-09-2020 , after using 17 days the phone is not working, not start. return window has been closed. many times trying contact to customer  service. Got a single reply return and exchange window has been closed.please don't buy.

"
"

  It's brilliant. 100% value for money. Great battery life, awesome camera quality, and vibrant screen colours as seen in the image. The back panel is so beautiful and different than every other phone that you would feel bad to cover it up!Strong and sturdy as well, the M01 Core does it's job at the price it's tagged in.

"
"

  Poor quality no return performance is too bad

"
"

  It's horrible. Got switched off on its own just 4 days. Shocked after buying from Amazon. Horrible seller product. Have asked for a tech visit. Amazon it's our hard earned Mone kindly refund.

"
"

  waste product, not getting/picking battery charge... thinking to throw on sellers head for providing such bad quality handset

"
"

  Right choice for only general users.. battery life is perfect as this segment.. camera quality as this range is being best..

"
"

  Manufacturing defectNeed to replace

"
"

  Pathetic Heating issue SAMSUNG will become Next NOKIA I buyed SAMSUNG M01 Also same Heating Issue With Love with Amazon

"
"

  It has a bit heating issues but over all at this price it is a good dealBest for elderly people or people with less usage of cell phone

"
"

  Low cost less featureValue of price is satisfiedPhone recommend for people who want upgrade to smart phone from keypad phone with very less use-ageSound quality is lowTouch screen sense is okFrom internal gb for storage is occupied by pre-installed app 50% apps are useful from pre-installed

"
"

  This phone is not good. It is getting hot very quickly. Even after talking 10 minutes it will become very hot and the battery life is also not good. The phone will be switched off automatically after gei hot. Overall I am not satisfied with this. Total waste of money. So please don't buy this phone anyone.

"
"

  The delivered phone was not functioning Properly, frequently get switched off planning for replacement.The replaced one is in good condition and working good.Suitable for elders those who need a simple phone for calling and social medias.

"
"

  Within one day of use the phone randomly switched off. I tried to charge it and pressed the pwer key but there was no response. After a few tries i figured it out. This phone switches off randomly and can only be switched on by pressing volume key and power key simultaneously.

"
"

  I give zero start to this phone and also to amazon for not replacing this. Very disappointing, waste of money. Now I decided to didn't shop anymore from Amazon ..

"
"

  Totally waste of money..I purchased Samsung M01 core Mobile on 17 August 2020, today ( 17/9/2020) mobile is dead. mobile switched off automatically.Mobile is not working any other functions like format and Boot..So don't buy this product please. my money is wasted..😢

"
"

  I have gifted this Phone to Mr.Imran Ali Shamsi at Rampur -UP.He has received. He told me that it held up too much.Please advise someine to Contact Him on Tel- No-92590 64396  and resolve the matter.If Phone is defective, please arrange replacement.

"
"

  Worst product ever got. Mobile is not turning on now. I can’t able to return.

"
"

  Please do not buy this phone as its battery or some software is faulty right from the beginning. After not even a week's use a message comes up saying that the battery is overheating and then the phone gets switched off.

"
"

  Camera quality is nice in this budget and Battery life is good for normal user I don't recommend it to heavy users because Processor is normal and good in this price .Screen quality is TFT LCD which is nice ,Overall this is the best smartphone in this budget.

"
"

  Good phone in this price range.And it isn't made in China,so extra points for that.Like other reviewers have mentioned,this phone shuts down, in the first day,just force reboot it and it won't give any problems afterwards.

"
"

  In product description handset is available with phone is written but it is not there in product.Wrong Information is being provided by Amazon.

"
"

  Product is good but some software are not working as zoom app.... Cell has over heating issues while talking or watching videos or charging... Suggest not to get this mob if u ve another option

"
"

  Very poor battery phone is heating while using it for 5minutes poor performance poor quality Product please don't buy it waste of money and time

"
"

  Value for money can't say much but according to brand it can be a OKAY deal. Small size and dum processing speed. You can get better device at this price of any other brand. Samsung can do better

"
"

   Amazing mobile phone from the Samsung company which is available in very low price designed with features which can be easily accessed by anyone (older adults) this product is best for our parents. Thank you samsung for such a great product

"
"

  The product is damn too good. It offers a good display with a decent battery life. I actually bought it for regular usage and a little bit of gaming which it carries out quite well. I am very much satisfied with this product..Thank you SamsungYou nailed it..

"
"

  After one and half month it's batter charging stopped , when i connected to phone not  showing charging , when make phone switch off and then it's showing charging but some time not showing ,Bad product

"
"

  phone is poor performance...slow , screen touch also not good..better not to go for this option even of you have budget constraints.very disappointed and no help from Amzon..no replacement request accepted even phone issie reported withinh 5 days of arrival

"
"

  Do not buy, waste of money.Phone is heating, charging takes lot of time, network loses automalically , go for a better one ""Samsung"" losses it's quality here !

"
"

  I bought this mobile for my daughter online class on zoom.But this mobile is not supporting zoom ap.Incoming voice problem.I found this problem today and make up my mind to return this mobile but I found that amazon had closed the return door today.bad luck.no use of new mobile.

"
"

  I am very happy that i bought a new phone in my budget .About this phone . The phone is very good looking and very smooth .Little bit lagging problem otherwise its all okThanksParshant kumar

"
"

  Worst product after using one hour, the phone got dead and in the beginning unable to read the sim. Simply disappointed. If the same issue raised by so many customers, why amazon selling such defective products, without resolving such issues.

"
"

  I bought 2 same phone, one got dead and one very slow and heating problem, then i try to get it return from Amazon at 9th sep 20, but 14 th no one came for take it back, nor i get any call from Amazon,Kindly return both phonesQuality of phones are poorHighly disappointed

"
"

  Really superb smartphone at 6499 I gifted this smart phone to my mom she is very happy it is very reasonable price and very light weight mobile battery packup is good 5star rating and camera is good over all mobile is very good and nice... I really love it.... Thank you samsung and amazon

"
"

  I bought this product on 14th september.On 25th september my phone automatically gets switch off and never opened.i cant able to open the phone and it does not work.What can i do now.I bought this phone in my pocket money which i collected like a bird.please do somthing

"
"

  To be honest.. This phone is meant for parents. I got this for my granny she was happy it's good for people who don't use phone much. It will not be durable for teenagers and people who live on phone a lot.... But a samsung phone @5k is too good.... Received on time... Thank you Amazon.

"
"

  The battery life is not good and the time taken to charge battery is very high. Moreover phone is getting turned off again and again and do not switch on easily.

"
"

   Last night i kept my phone for charging... But then today when I woke up i was trying to switch it on... But it was not switching on... Can you please help me with this problem as soon as possible... Please can u help me with this problem

"
"

  My dear friends don't buy it. It's cheating.. Mobile hanging is very often cannot call also.. Better buy a cheap less than 1k... Don't go for it.. Anyhow I returned it with lot of fight with amazon..

"
"

  I ordered this phone, but just one month only working, suddenly ph is not working . I don’t know what is that problem.

"
"

  I just purchased the phone on amazon .in a few weeks ago , but unfortunately it suddenly turned off and won't start again. After charging it for several times its just not working . I  bought the phone for Rs. 4999/  and the amount of money is really precious to me .

"
"

  After long time very compact smart device by samsungEntry level mobile user best buying chooseCamera averageBattery life more than one day usageScreen quality above average

"
"

  Processor is so slow that does not even support zoom without lag.  Front camera video quality very dark in normal light room.  Battery drains very fast in light uses. Colour reproduction of the screen is not so good. At the price point of 6499 this product is wastage of money.

"
"

  I think this phone is perfect for general useIt has good battery backup,Comes out of the box Android 10 based on Android one program no bloatware and very smooth UI.The thickness of the phone is very good no need of back cover because of the texture.

"
"

  if you want to gift a phone to ur parents then this is best phone. Battery stays i think easily for a day without heavy usage. but u cant play high end games like cod or pubg in this. and if you are going to buy it then buy the 2gb variant

"
"

  Slow interface and all apps are on go version which does not work to its full potential.

"
"

  Samsung M01 over all a good and budget phone by its looks and price but there are a big problem in phone and It  becomes to hot during call and use of internet over cellular network . I hope this will not be in all future handsets and company will take acre this problem.

"
"

  Product was delivered before the time. Though simple and small in size it has a smooth touch with all basic facility like any other smart phone.

"
"

  Screen quality very impressive,Light weight and handy,Looks very Cute,Sound quality is great,Only RAM is less, but the price also matters.Overall a good deal and nice product from Samsung. 👍

"
"

  Phone is awesome till now..battery is also good, camera quality is also good overall in this range samsung delivered good phone . Best part is that, it is very light in weight ,very handy and all apps are run very smooth.

"
"

  Galaxy M01 core is really best smartphone for normal use...Display quality is superb... And battery backup is also good...Overall Product is very good in everything

"
"

  Phone is good with nice display, battery and response time. But just forget that it comes with a camera. Camera is not usable for a photo or a video.

"
"

  Serves best for basic users,I took for my mother who only uses whatsapp and calls only

"
"

  It's a small phone but but feels jus like an iphone. It's really cool and compact. Perfect budget phone. The selfie camera isnt great but back camera is awesome.

"
"

  I bought Samsung M01 core on 15'th aug and today  ( within a week ) it has stopped working. Now I am struggling to find service center and reach out to Sansung

"
"

  THANK YOU SAMSUNG MOBILE LTDI AM BUYING M01 THIS PHONE IS VERY GOOD GIFT FOR MY WIFE COMFORT MOBILE GOOD FOR GIRLS👩‍⚕️👩‍🎓👩‍⚖️ THANK YOU AMAZON

"
"

  After using this mobile for just one week I came to the conclusion that this mobile is a failure model since it has a high amount of heating problems during charging and very poor battery. I returned this product within a week and switched to another mobile.

"
"

  This phone is not performing as expected. Phone is hang most of the times and getting warm very often.I have a very bad feedback on this phone as it stop responding with in 15 days of use. This is not expected from Samsung.

"
"

  Disatisfied with the product. The sound and mic are not good. Amazom has replaced a product but it is with same issue. Hence returning for refund. I will.go with different brand now. Not satisfied with samsung now.  They are cmning dwn on quality

"
"

  I got this mobile at time.Good phone with Google Go edition.Everything is fine and gentle. For those who have limited work ,not hunger for Games.

"
"

  Good Mobile.

"
"

  Don't ever buy this phone, within 5 days my Phone is dead! Performance was lagging since 2nd day, battery life is very poor, takes a lot if time to charge.Now I have requested to return but they aren't even considering my request!

"
"

  Must buy according to price.Very smooth and friendly user interface.Camera quality is very good.Samsung is a very reputed and good brand providing top features in this price segment.

"
"

  I got this Samsung Galaxy M01 Core on September 05th and this mobile is not been working from September 14th onwards without having any damages. It's automatically switched off and we we were tried to switched on but not able to do, so please help me.

"
"

  After one day the phone has become dead. Even after full charge it is not working. Please let me know how to return.

"
"

  Battery is worst part of this phone.At this price nothing much expected.Too much lag or hanging freezing alote.Just use it for calling and WhatsApp only.

"
"

  Cheap qualityI love Samsung but found cheap qualityThe cable wire used for changer along with sim tray wrose Chinese itemMade mistake

"
"

  My humble request don't buy this product. Completely 3rd class product and not even worth of 1000 Rs. In all aspects thus model got failed . Don't fall into the trap by seeing the price and AMAZON don't even provide return option for this product.

"
"

  Third class product I cant keep it even for free and now amazon is making foolosh by ssying to dounload fake aaps in witch costumers had maken comments that this is fake

"
"

  Delivered 15.8.2020. The phone just stops working  every  2-3 days and needs to be taken to Samsung dealer. It’s absolutely useless. While charging it gets very heated.

"
"

  This is good for 2nd phone look wise good, average battery life & camera quality, full value of money, services of Amazon is good delived in time

"
"

  Return window is closed and phone stop working in 15days..... please don't buy this phone

"
"

  Phone is good , rear camera good,front camera average, battery life good, display size in length good but width narrow ,price good , weight perfect, charging late,But one problem delivery is lateI received phone after due date....

"
"

  Pathetic Service by amazon. Providing defective piece with no option to exchange it for a better model.

"
"

  tHIS IS REALLY SURPRISING THAT THE PHONE IS DEAD AFTER USING 15 DAYS.

"
"

  It's really value for money and light weight.  I have purchased both Samsung Galaxy M01 Core 1GB and Samsung Galaxy M01 Core 2GB .

"
"

  Good product but i given 4star because size is too small ....

"
"

  This brand new mobile after inserting the SIM CARD and started downloading the apps it worked for just five minutes and screen got switched off and is not getting on from then on. It is the worst product that I have bought in Amazon.

"
"

  Product is fine enough to use but  more expected from samsung price is under 5500 improve your charger it's take 6..7hrs to charge full

"
"

  Would like to thank the Amazon Delivery team for the quicker Delivery.It's a Good Product to use and user-friendly with basic features.Recommended for Secondary phone or Minimal usage Smartphone.

"
"

  It heats up very quickly and stops running..I was return the product but this product return policy it's not available ... I hated Amazon .. so cheap Amazon company .. it's company terms and conditions it's totally lie.. .

"
"

  its good n value fr money n more over brands says everything .me n my whole family using samsung n nw my charity hv donated this phone to a girl ......she too like it ....

"
"

  Thanka Samsung and Amazon for providing a phone affordable to my pocket that enables my wife to help kida in their  online study. Thanks Samsumg once again to help my family in undisturbed learning.Thanks !!!!!!

"
"

  Totally disappointed in Amazon.After reading other people's reviews, I came to know many customers have received defective phones and are struggling for replacement.Not expecting this for 'Amazon fulfilled' product.

  Please don’t buy this phone. Very slow. Poor audio quality. Poor battery life. It’s just only 11 days since I bought it.

"
"

  1. Good product.2. Price is justified but mobile is of small size with less features.3. Good mobile for voice, video and data communication.4. Camera is average.5. Battery backup is also good.

"
"

  i dont know what is the problem with this mobile. after two weeks of useage, its not working now. its not evening turning on. China mobiles would work longer than this.

"
"

  I have used many Samsung mobiles. I find them user friendly. Featues are good in Samsung Galaxy M01 Core.  Only problem with Samsung mobile is it has too many inbuild software.

"
"

  Weak processor. Weak camera. Average battery life. I bought for 6499 and after 10 days Amazon was selling it for 5999. Phone hangs while doing daily work. It gives ok type user experience only.

"
"

  Phone is getting heated within 5 min of uses, Screen was very sluggish... While speaking over phone won't able to hold phone... Battery will drain like 5 years old phone...

"
"

  Decent phone ideal for those who switch from feature phone to smart phone or your parents. M not saying that, everything is top notch features in this phone but still brand name and the price segment is worthy to buying.

"
"

  Mobile is automatically dead while using and not came up even after charging. Very poor battery backup not even 2hr with playing and one day standby.Camera quality is too bad.Don't buy this mobile.

"
"

  Light weight, beautiful appearance that makes you fall for it, and of course value for money.

"
"

  This phone is quite sleek n compact. Its got good screen quality n picture clarity. Battery life is also too good for the price range. This is the best phone in market with a budget of 5k.

"
"

  Budget friendlyIt's a middle class choice

"
"

  luckily Phone is good , but package is opened before delivery. Without checking I had paid money to the delivery person. Please instruct the delivery persons to not to tamper the packing etc., Charger is very delicate.

"
"

  If you are looking for a alternative phone or to gift to your parents This one is really good. Coz as u all know less RAM and smaller size is enough and good for older people and to use as a temporary or alternatively

"
"

  Just OK Product, Samsung should reduce the pricing as compared to other Chinese phones. In that cost, Chinese phones offer premium service while Samsung doesn't

"
"

  RAM SPEEED DULL,CAMERA LIKE 5MP, CHARGING TIME 4 HRS,BACKUP OK.AFTER USING 4 DAYS POWER OFF AND NOT TURNING ON CUSTOMER CARE SAYING WAIT 7 DAYS FOR TECHNICIAN TO CONFIRM DEFECTIVE PIECE.*******DONT BUY*********

"
"

  Use product deliver to me.opne box in use the handset after sell

"
"

  Great value for money phone;pros:>Battery backup is awesome>has dark mode.>2GB ram and 32 GB storage with additional sd card slotCons:>taking lot of time to charge

"
"

  After one week of use , the product went dead and not able to restart. Unfortunately the return window is closed. So we son't know what to do with this faulty product.

"
"

  very quick delivery, phone is average built quality, performance is ok, but no Samsung special features in this phone, house peoples gift this phone, camera is average, battery medium average, screen look nice👍👍👍

"
"

  The mobile is very light weight. Although the phone is good.But it has a problem of OVER HEATING. You don not make a video call over 10 minute.  After 20 to 30 minutes use it runs slow.

"
"

  Don't buy this .waste of money ...over heating and hang problem ...no return no replace ...dont buy from this seller

"
"

  On 15 th day of delivery of mobile, mobile got shut down automatically. Not started after several attempt.Called Amazon, they said sorry could not help.

"
"

  It's good at this price range. Battery life shoul be extended a little more and camera should be improved too. I'm impressed by looking this type of screen quality at this price range. Well done Samsung👍

"
"

  The Phone has gone totally dead after 7 days...Is it manufacturing defect or is it due to delivery of substandard items....It needs to be replace.... process of warranty...its cumberson through online...

"
"

  I have received a call from technician Amazon,so very helpful,,mobile is going well now

"
"

  Overall phone is good but the internet calling and camera is not at it's best. Battery life also okay and it is in budget

"
"

  Value for money, donot expect much,its good

"
"

  Worst phone ever seen. The phone doesnt work, gets switched off within 2 days and never gets on. I got this phone replaced 2 times and still faced same issue.Dont buy is my review!

"
"

  Heating issues and battery  drains at rapid speed..

"
"

  Good design and battery, overall a good phone at this price range but I am getting some heating issues but not a deal breaker.

"
"

"
"

  Phone doesn't support some apps , while using the zoom app phone is strucking,sometimes audio and some times video is strucking, we can't see both in 1 time . It's performing like 256 mb ram phone not 2 gb ram .

"
"

  The product was not working from the 2nd day of purchase...even after escalating the problem to amazon..their response was hands free..now I have to depend on the seller for the service of NEWLY owned product...

"
"

  There is some issue in sim slot because of which network reception is poor

"
"

  Good product... But sometimes feeling that it's slow processing... its having 2GB RAM but not so effective performance

"
"

  I was sick of big phones tearing my pockets, at this price this is just amazing, thanks a million samsung, like always,

"
"

  This phone is worst... After one month the phone is dead and not charging also. I am not sure if this covers in warranty and it is additional work to go to service center.

"
"

  Very nice product..... I know that Samsung is the best Electronics Brand so I brought this Phone..... I am glad for use this..... Phone on top ranked by me I guve 5 stars of this Phone.....

"
"

  Within five days of purchase, problem occur  in display. Now the phone under dead condition. I have to run to service centre. All service center are too far from my location. So total waste and mental torture.

"
"

  Value for money.. good clarity, great storage space.Some times the mobile hangs with no response. To full charge, it takes close to 2 hours

"
"

  Battery got.discharged suddenly and did not wake up normally....samsung support advise to wake up using vol key+power key..it started again...otherwise value for money..good phone

"
"

  This phone is one of the best purchases i have ever made. It is best for whatsapp,facebook and other social media apps.Battery life is also good.Sound quality is upto the mark.Camera is also good. Must buy !!

"
"

  Product is very bad.Product purchased on 24th Sep and mobile is dead on 1st Oct.Replace window also closed on 1st Sep.What to do in this situation. Amazon should look into the matter for immediate replacement

"
"

  My phone just suddenly stop working and the display is off it is not getting switch on or off please tell me what to do. This happened when i was using my phones hotspot

"
"

  Good one in this range.2,32 is goodBattery should be 4000mah to fulfill all requirements but as Samsung is a famous brand so can't expect everything in such low cost

"
"

  Problem with signal the call will drop  in middle of conversation

"
"

  This phone stopped working after 4 hours of use. It didn’t get switched on again. Whenever  camera was on, it went very hot. Completely damaged product was given to me. Don’t buy from this seller.

"
"

  Good for this price

"
"

  Revie after 15 days of using mobile, battery comes for 4 to 5 hours in standby. Poor battery life

"
"

  Don't buy this handset... Not worth to pay this amount.. We cannot download anything#hangup#no music folder only Spotify.. Not happy with this handset can't return also.. Only replacement with same handset

"
"

  Its a good phone . Its Price is worth it . Display is amazing . Camera is kinda okay . The best thing is that it have android 10 go version .also light weighted .And last its trustworthy brand .

"
"

  Poor sound quality for music. Battery is draining faster, not continuing for one day in normal use. Not a good phone in ₹ 6499. Can it be possible to replace with other M series from the same seller ?

"
"

  Samsung is always best option as compare to other but I think the quality is not appropriate of this product. But in this buzet this is still the best choice..😇

"
"

  Very good one in this cost range.

"
"

  Nice , working fine up till now.. it’s been a month

"
"

  on the day of reciving the phone, it switched off all of a sudden and doesnt start back, when i tried to do a replacement , its a terrible return or help service from amazon. I didn't get any help.

"
"

  The phone charging is very very slow and suddenly goes into sleep mode. Once in sleep mode it does not charge and battery gets drained. It's not even one month and already visited the gallery twice

"
"

   I m really disappointed with the services , I purchased the phone as a gift for my mother-in-law after 2days phone goes completely dead ...bad experience

"
"

   Good

"
"

  Phone has switched off completely after 2 weeks of usage.Check for other reviews and you can find similar complaint.Do not waste your money with this phone.

"
"

  The phone is working smoothly.

"
"

  This is worst smartphone in market doesnot support many apps as well as take 7 hours in full charge. Screen is not very good and camera is worst if someone give this me in free i will not take it.

"
"

  Battery Backup is goodScreen quality is opCamera is goodI like a mobile screen qualityNo lag No heatYou play a free fire in ultra graphics in 1gb ram in this mobile

"
"

  It’s not even been a day we’ve had it and it doesn’t turn on. Called Amazon and they say they’d send a technician!?? Ridiculous- why won’t they replace it?

"
"

  Battery was not charging from day 1, it always shows 30%

"
"

  Though the phone was worth it money but it stopped working after a day or three i have called the amazon service agent and they said tomorrow they will call waiting for it.

"
"

  Battery Life : ok at this price.Camera quality: don't use in night.  In Light Camera Performance is Tooo Good.Overall  : this phone nice choice for your parents

"
"

  I purchased a new phone on 12 Aug 2020, now it's suddenly switched off and tried my best to switch on but unable, so total waste of money

"
"

  Battery drains fast charging is very slowHeating issueIf you want to online classes or play a gameYour fingers feel burnBut phone is enough to that price segment

"
"

  Good mobile with in the budget . Hardy set with good quality but camera is not so good but overall it gives peace of mind

"
"

  Product was faulty. This mobile automatically got switched off. I also faced with difficulty while charging this phone. I would suggest spend few thousand rupees extra & buy another product

"
"

  Some functions are not available for better battery life

"
"

  The video calling and zoom application is not working with this phone. It is having audio issues only at the times of video call and zoom meeting.other than that all are in good condition.

"
"

  Worst experience of life in buying the mobile. Amazon not able to replace the faculty piece. Phone is dead on the date of delivery. My appeal to the customers not buy products from Amazon.

"
"

  Did not meet basic expectations

"
"

  Good phone to use as secondary. Light weight. Very difficult to find tempered glass for the phone.Camera very average. Overall a very average phone. Did not find any cons as of now.

"
"

  Nice Phone  this price.

"
"

  Lightweight,suitable as a second phone,senior citizens will like it.sufficient m emory for apps,my earlier samsung on 5 was lacking in memory.smooth perormance.a perfect gift to parents.

"
"

  the best part of this phone is very sleek in the model and handy lighter in weight. Worst part very very slow like an earthworm. I don't think its value for money...!

"
"

  The battery life is pathetic and the phone is turning off automatically. Would suggest not to buy this phone.Amazon support is also poor and they have refused to return the phone

"
"

  Budget phone very good it’s awesome perfect phone in low range price price is lesser than redmi phonesI got world’s best brand phone for 5.5k

"
"

  Worst phone ever purchased no battery life no good to use and stopped working just after 1 month and no service total waste of money... disguisting and not recommended at all

"
"

  Value for money

"
"

  Phone comes with 1gb of ram, hangs a lot and switches off automatically. It's better spend 1 or 2k more and buy a mobile with 2+gb ram & better hardware

"
"

  Great piece for basic home use.

"
"

  Slik and handy. Value for money received the item within a day.

"

"
"

  Phone permanently dead within 15 days. No replacement after 1 week as Amazon displayed. Now what can I do? Thinking for go to consumer court instead of service centre.

"
"

  Bad camera quality, exchanged with Samsung on5 which has same camera feature but on5 was far better. Heating problem as well, battery drains out very quickly

"
"

  As per budget this is a good phone. Camera &screen quality is good but battery power is not so satisfactory .Thanks to Samsung for giving a smartphone in this budget.

"
"

  Overall a good product from Samsung at this price range. The battery life is average.  The camera quality is good. The display screen is large . Connectivity is good.

"
"

  Battery drain very fast, mobile heats too much,inncessary pre-installed Applications, and important thing don't buy this product from amazon, because of poor service

"
"

  WHILE IN OPERATION THE PHONE GET HEATED UP TOO MUCH,BATTERY LIFE OKCAMERA FUNCTIONING OKNEED IMMEDIATE REPLACEMENT OF MOBILE SET AS FEEL DEFECTIVE.

"
"

  Do not buy this phone ever & replacement is also dead within 3 days. Samsung for India is a bogus initiative and misleading. This phone is a failure model.

"
"

  It is completely dead after using one week.. The mobile just shut off automatically and doesn't turn on.. waste of money.. i need it to be replaced at any cost....

"
"

  I worst my money. After 8hours charging when I switch on the mobile is heating.And i don't have no option for return. Only for repair solutions in amazon aap

"
"

  Nice product ...sleek phone with good quality

"
"

  This phone can be use as secondary/for aged person.screen size little bit small for regular use.

"
"

  Very good mobile phone in its price range.Battery life is good.Camera quality is  normal,long screen good for gaming and video playing,slim design,value of money.

"
"

  best phone for just basic uses,if you are a hardcore gamer or a mobi addict i won't recommend it,it gives performance as it worth,best phone to buy at this price.

"
"

  Not working that day

"
"

  This is an overall good phone.But in case of camera quality it's not good. More than that the processor speed is low and the phone starts heat!

"
"

  It's just awesome, the camera, battery and looks worth buying. I bought this for my Dad for his birthday. Thank you Amazon for timely delivery.

"
"

  My samsung m01 core battery back up is very low and it takes more than 8 hours to get charged completely.... Kindly replace my battery with in guarantee period..

"
"

  Product is good light weight and value for money. But camera quality can slightly be better. Otherwise according to 2gb ram mobile it is good.

"
"

  This phone got problem of getting over heated while in call and the battery condition is also poor, I didn't expect this from branded company.

"
"

  The screen touch is good but litile less smaller. Overall goog one thouse who use smartphone in basic usses or new comer... I gave 3.7 star...

"
"

  After 10days of usage, Mobile switch off any time.And doesn't restart with power button. Defective product delivered by Amazon.

"
"

  Third class product

"
"

  Good

"
"

  Good battery backup and camera quality is also good but screen is little bit small but overall performance is quite good at reasonable price.

"
"

  phone got off after the return period is over and not working, was getting heated up after 15 mins

"
"

  Battery life is ok, camera quality is not very great screen quality is fine. Phone hangs usually.

"
"

  Mobile Look is Ok but Speed is Slow,and then amazon courier service is very poor customer service for Delivery...

"
"

  This is not getting  charged , brand new mobile sent to my old mother leaving in another city,problem for me because of this quality issue.

"
"

  Worst phone quality, this seller is selling defective product. Phone is not charging. There is not standard charger. There is no headphone.

"
"

  While doing video call, front camera quality became worst....even in room light objects wr not clear n dark...Poor video call quality

"
"

  Absolutely awesome product in this range

"
"

  Nice Product.....Happy with it’s  features in this price......😊😊😊

"
"

"
"

  Battery way too lowCamera is just okDisplay is fineDoesn't have light sensor uses camera for automatic screen brightness

"
"

  Not satisfy with the brand. It breaks my heart on sumsung brand. So many disappointments in one product. I regret why I bought this phone.

"
"

"

"
"

  Send defective phone and not charging and when put charging phone is automatically switched off

  this pohe is excelent...and this phone  had some new featers its data conection is perfect and very very fast its display is perfect and so nice,beatiful,nice controling smooth phone handeling i think this is the supper phone i ever buy.......battery is most power full long time storage i want to buy this phone again and the  phone color is so beautiful andvery shine,and about the camera no words about it....becaus the phones highlite is the camera.....selfi is excelantand so clarity in camera the company give us a plane back cover.and game when we start to play the phone chang hismode to game space in game space no disterbence in at there andscreen recorded is so claretableno hang in the phone i am playing ""free fire""""pubg""""fifa mobile""""dream leuge""and etc...i am playing these games every day phone had no hang.i like its gaming....and the game space.its camera had new featers like plano,camera,video,piono,bluring,and most beatiful editing...i am dicided to buy a new one and give the phone to my brother on his birthday...../""PLEAS TRY THIS""""I THINK THAT YOU MUST WANT THIS KIND OF PHONE""

"
"

  The phone comes with 4gb RAM and talks about clocking excess of 2 GHz clock speed. The camera is ok and gives out decent pics. Battery life is good but sadly, no fast/dash/vooc charging available.PUBg games works on Low settings so very big disappointment here. Too much lag when try to change the Graphics settings. I would say the product description was very misleading in claiming that Games are supported.Keeping the price in mind, I would say decent phone but not worth going for if you wanted specs to match the performance.

"
"

  Headphones is missing. Worst experience.

"
"

  Everything is just awesome about this phone... Every penny is a worth.. The look is premium and it runs so smooth.. No complaints so far.. Touchwood... Oppo is always trustworthy

"
"

  The screen resolution of this phone is very poor.At a glance it looks like a 5 inch phone.U will find difficult to use this phone if you go out of your house in sunlightPicture quality is not good as claimedYou find difficult to read the contents on screen because resolution of the phone is not at all good.Battery life is good.Sound quality is also not goodBetter, try for some good brand phone

"
"

  I am getting issue with my phone, issue started after return window close on 26th August voice Eco starts and sometimes videos become blur. Complaint on 4 or 5th SEP. to amazon cce said return window close have to go to service center, there Eco issue resolve but getting that video issue at times now new issue starts. When recieve call light didn't turn on automatically have to check phone after listening ringtone. I think there is some manufacturing in it, tired of visiting service center again and again. Amazon team you have to do something.

"
"

  Super phone.... Nice display.. camera clarity and nice features...Phone design is very nice...If u need a budget friendly classy mobile go for it

"
"

  Best exchange offer by oppoI buy with exchange just 6800

"
"

  Satisfied with the product but handset not received..

"
"

  Nice & value for money

"
"

  Awesome, working wellUsing since 5th May 2019.

"
"

  Perfect phone for moderate user. Not for gaming but battery,looks, display, camera are optimised. But little overpriced. Price should be 7999/- instead of 8999/-

"
"

  After using 10 days product performance was not felling well. It's worrest performance and if any updates will phone will not start up only sleeping mode. My complete review was oppo A5s mldel was failure

"
"

  Ok phone, my earlier Moto g5 was faster than this phone. When I click on any icon on the screen there is 1 sec delay already..... little slowness. Notifications are not displaying on top as icons because of the camera on the top bar. We need to swipe down always to check any notifications. I feel Pure Android phones are better from the usability point of view.

"
"

  I think this oppo mobile is the best to use for me1. I LIKE the camara2. Finger print lock.

"
"

  I am writting this review after using the phone for one month. I think I made a good decision opting this one as it is worth every penny spent on it.Pros:-1. Aesthetically wonderful2. Battery life of 1.5 days with full usage3. Screen resolution is very good4. Front camera is niceCons:-1. Fast charging not available

"
"

  i purchase it on 18 and i got the delivery on 19. And on 27 the phone screen stopped working. We cannot see any thing on the screen. We can only here ringtone, but nothing on screen. Also now the speaker is also having problem. Speaker is blasted (phat gaya hai). I have removed the sim and started using old phone now.I think the Amazon and the supplier have shipped me a used or refurbished phone. Instead of a new one. And big problem , is that i cannot even return it now. And now this phone is totally turned off. Cannot see if it is charging, or not, cannot see anything on screen. Now amazon is telling me to contact manufacturer for this.I am not paying any thing for this.

"
"

  This is the useless phone evermade...... I prepared very much and participated in an online quiz (all around Asia) and this useless phone cheated me...no internet connection when submitting...😖😞 I participated in another national level quiz... In the time of submitting.....it crashed........useless...useless for hundred times.When we capture a cow, we could see a dog in the picture.. such worst...No value fore money... It was hard to make this money and I buyed this phone for 9,900 rupees from Amazon. When I checked this in other sites, it was only 8,900 rupees and less.Amazon fooled me...NEVER BUY THIS PHONE....

"
"

  The fingerprint scanner is less responsive but the look of mobile is quite good. Best if you are not a gamer. Good for normal usage. Good battery backup, runs whole day.

"
"

  Supper mobileValue for money

"
"

  Waste product. Encountered many faults after one week of phone delivery like camera and flash light is not working. Service center in nellore is not responding properly. Its very unfortunate that moving around service center within 10 days of phone purchase.Very disappointed. Even after one month the company has not done service. Worst service and worst product. Plz dont buy this phone.

"
"

  Very nice in all aspects , I value for the offer and price comparing the quality,Excellent, the only con is the weight feel a bit heavy and no head phone in box

"
"

  Not using for a long time hardly two week. So cannot comment so much but so far so good till now. Charging time phone is getting hot some times and picture quality is not fully clear.

"
"

  Overall a good product. One thing to be mentonable here that this product is having three slots. One for SD Card which is very useful.

"
"

  Nice mobile.i loved it. too good mobile .front camera is nice.lookwise superb.

"
"

  Battery life is good for a day and charging very fast using provided charger, do not use other charger. Finger print scanner also good, overall value for money.It's very slow mobile because of 2GB RAM, UI is very worse compare to MIUI

"
"

  Fingerprint is ok. When the phone is used normally, the battery runs for a maximum of 2 days.If you are using online, the maximum will last for 18 hours.You can use it comfortably for 24-25 hours on offline use.If the price of this phone was up to 9000 then it was fine but buying it above 9000 is not right.

"
"

  Security features,Outlook,Display and sound  great,camera average...

"
"

  This was ordered for a young friend, who seems very happy with his phone...that's all I can tell you .

"
"

  Awesome mobile with buiable amountThey send protected cover and screen cover already past very happy to buy Amazon.Battery is also fineOverall good to buy at the price worthyThank to amazon i am satisfied with this.

"
"

  Phone is no doubt really gud I got a Very gud deal.  But I didn't get my 1000 cashback on Amazon...as in chat customer care executive asked me for SS ...now how cm it is available... after a week I asked they said it ll to 15-20 days.....by afterwards nothing hpnd...really sad

"
"

  The phone has just very basic features. Except for the looks of phone nothing is exceptional not even camera that Oppo boasts about. It is for the people who are contended with basics.

"
"

  I have been using oppo mobiles and love these phones in terms of quality durability and performance and mostly during exchange offers I get good deal with oppo phones,  but one thing is for sure, this is not the best phone on its category.

"
"

  Phone's speaker got damaged a month after purchase, although the phone has so far been handled with utmost care.Oppos customer care could not be contacted as it seemed all their nos. we're either out of service or invalid.Disappointed!

"
"

  I purchased OPPO mobile which was to come with offer of screen protection. After purchasing the same, one day I received an email stating that screen protection has been cancelled. I could not understand the reason and they are only asking for documents and invoices.

"
"

  There is no headphone

"
"

  It's awesome phone within this price and with all the ""what not"" features like finger sensor, hd camera, comfortable charging point lid, speaker quality, etc.

"
"

  It is a good entry level phone. However Camera and Ear speaker are not upto the mark.

"
"

  I will get it from exchange offer so its good ...I buy this phn for my mom... But according to me some time it did not process as fst as i want to..... But at this price its a cool stuff

"
"

  Can't revive full associers with the phone like ear phoneI always revive by oppo product but this time not revive with the order it's not good sign I  not happy with the product and seller I want to return it

"
"

  According to price it is worth buying with tech upgrade. Only dissapointment for me being hearing impaired, provision of ear phone if made could have given more comfort. Media speaker is better though.

"
"

  Earphone not recived. Please provide earphone in box theres a slot for earphone. How can company not provide earphone.Even 500 rs Phone also comes with earphone. This is disgusting

"
"

  Overall good value for money. Happy with the product.

"
"

  It's camera clarity is very very poor. I think a VJA cam is far far better than it's 8MP front cam. I was using an oppo phone since 4 years. That is why I choose the same brand again. But it disappointed me.

"
"

  After few months getting some issues with fingerprint reader and another thing the screen story get repeated same story which was very disappointing

"
"

  Very nice smartphone, camera quality is so cool.

"
"

  Electronics will receive standard only

"
"

  Every this is nice...only display is below standards... compared to other phones in this range.

"
"

  The smartphone is useful who are not use all application, means who are less use of smartphone applications.

"
"

  It's been 3 months since I'm using it no lag battery is great go for it

"
"

  Fingerprint works very fast.Baatery backup is also good.Main thing is works as duals volte.if you do internet with Airtel or Voda then jio sim will also works..

"
"

  Nice features but little bit upgrade system..

"
"

  Oppo A5S bought one month ago, The mobile was suddenly switched off when I using and again try to switch on the phone but not on the mobile.  Now my phone is dead. Camara quality is very low.

"
"

  This phone is awesome. Best value for money buget phone. Battery life is best.

"
"

  The camera quality is a problem here. The display we gets 720p@60fps. The fastest fingerprint reader. Battery life is kind of ok.

"
"

  This Product is ok, But the Seller is not File the GST Returns and Not made the Payments. Even he did not respond the Buyer/Customer Query. Please take on this in your concern and revert back to me.

"
"

  Nice phoneBut when someone calls the display can’t appear sometimes

"
"

  Worth to buy, Good looking.

"
"

  Loking

"
"

  Go for it without any doubt

"
"

  I have been facing difficulty in playing games specially when i open the game for the first time in my phone. Phone stops working and the screen also goes black for minimum 10 minutes and also heats up sometimes.

"
"

  Great product at a reasonable price and features.... Battery life suffices. Performance and user interface is smooth and efficient. Camera is ok for this price range.

"
"

  i like this phone is not heating. totally it's good product

"
"

  The product is light weight comes with tempered Glass and cover. UI is good and fast.Hassle free exchange unlike flipkart.

"
"

  One drawaback is voice call over 4g Airtel Network always intermittent,not ever I have placed a single crystal clear call to our friend, it's a major fault in this set plz rectify it

"
"

  Nice product. I really happy to buy this Mobile

"
"

  Finger print reader is not functioning properly,I have to press it for a long time to sense

"
"

  Charger getting over heat

"
"

  It's good but I am disappointed about cost because another week its getting less amt and many others said it's old model

"
"

  Awesome deal, thanks

"
"

  Good product of this price

"
"

  After spending long time with Xiaomi I switched to OPPO. I almost waited for 2 months to make my mind.Excellent overall experience with product, you can feel the difference.

"
"

  I am Colling from Amazon customer service department. Camera regarding but not solve my problems 40 mints totally time West. Back and front camera picture quality very blurring.

"
"

  Good phone for its price

"
"

  According to price mobile is good. Camera quality also good.

"
"

  For a general operation good. Not for an avid user.

"
"

  It is only 3 days but seems to be good

"
"

  Overall good

"
"

  Good product. But not user friendly. My suggestion is use other option

"
"

  Phone camera is upto the mark, battery life is average ,fingerprint sensor not working properly

"
"

  Nise cellphone

"
"

  It is solving my purposes... This device I am using for phone calls,WhatsApp and emails. Daily I need to talk at least 3-4 hrs and battery is supporting well for past .

"
"

  Good phone in budget along with great exchange offer. Screen size is big enough and camera quality is good.

"
"

  Good product

"
"

  Battery life is too good. It is completing the charging in 45 mins. And more over we can the phone approx 1and half day. But the screen quality and sound is some bad.

"
"

  Nice colour & model.....

"
"

  Nice phone

"
"

  Good

"
"

  Worst buying this product. Bcoz no exchange options of this mobile in any online apps. So don't buy this item. You can not exchange this product with any other at online apps.

"
"

  Overall super, camera quality is exhalent mobile thank you amazon.

"
"

  Vivo and oppo compare to better vivo mobile  in oppo a5s mobile price very high and battery very low screen and back Dore quality in low

"
"

  Nice mobile super conditionI am using last two days still battery 40% remainingI got this phone in exchange offer(6000) and delivery boy also good

"
"

"
"

  Nice phone overall

"
"

"
"

"
"

  Phone is causing so much problem while receiving or dialling calls from the 2nd day itself.

  Not as expected...just okay

"
"

  Ok to use, not upto the mark

"
"

  Excellent

"
"

"
"

  Camera quality is not at all satisfactory.

"
"

  Value for money. Smooth Touch Screen. Great Camera.

"

  Very good choice for gamers because of its huge 4230 mah battery . It may play 6-7 hour continue gaming in 100% charge . I will it 5 star ratings.

"
"

  Amazing handset. Great face detection....Fingerprint sensor quite fast. Camera is good too. Overall its really great.Thank you Amazon.

  First time really very disappointed form vivo Y91i..mobile took too much time to charge only 6% charging took 30-40 minute to charge ..when i got this mobile it's bettery already was 30 % then after i pluged it 3.00 p.m. and at 7.00 p.m. it was only 86%...too much long time but not get full charged..before purchased this mobile i alreday seen this type review(  about charging problem) but i leave that sometimes it happend but when i used this i known that it is really a big problem in this  mobile...This TIME REALLY DISAPPOINTED BY VIVO..i never suggest to anyone to buy this vivo v91i .if there is any solution of this problem please suggest me..

"
"

  This phone is great but some of the greatest apps like Google assistant ( ok Google hotword don't work and you will need to manually open it, also Amazon Alexa and Microsoft Cortana hotword opening don't work

"
"

  There was no SIM insertion pin in the box.  Where to get that?

"
"

  man i am in love this phone usally i used to lava and other phones which are cheap and i used to feel y the battery is draining so much but seriosuly this phone has suprised me and i am in love with touchpad i coudlnt find a problem till now

"
"

  This mobile has a lightweight with average camera quality. It is a low budget phone with face unlocking. Nice working with good brightness on the screen. It is quite handy and easy to use for old people as well.Thanks

"
"

  Please dont buy this phone.  Not good, too much heating, working slow.. There is lots of another options in the same price with good performance & quality.  Even Amazon is not giving return & replacement options.

"
"

  I recently shifted to vivo and it was a disaster, The mobile phone started hanging on the very 3rd day.It is way to disappointing spending a lot on devices like these.

"
"

  nice looking

"
"

  Vivo fails me when a call comes in, signal catching on mobile and wireless network. an incoming call cannot be received as the receive button vanishes. some features like screen shot and vdo capture are excellent, looks wise beautiful, space was great. Only issue: sluggish!

"
"

  It is working fast and it is best in low rate and 1to2days stand able battery because if we worked hard it standard on 1day if you prefer low work it will standard 2days and system updating fun touch os will stand this phone to a longer life and about camera quality it's front camera is really awesome and selfie camera is best. For simple users  this phone works very because it is a Indian brand. So it is best.

"
"

  i got this for 8k. look wise its grt. display n face recognition s cool. you cn def go fa this. as usual amazon was prompt with d delivery..

"
"

  Screen quality & battwry are very good, but picture quality is very bad.

"
"

  Sometimes automatically ring when phone is not my hand . Phone hearing quality is not good . Sometimes it becomes hang. Oh what a wrong decision that  lbought this phone.

"
"

  Battery, Camera overall performance is good.Sometimes get heated during use. I am using for 2/3 months. The set got hanghed thrice during my use.

"
"

  Excellent phone at this cost. Touch is extremely smooth. Highly recommended. Only issue in opening shortcut from home screen. I love phones having shortcut keys on top instead of bottom as in bottom there are other keys as well and when you try to open shortcut it opens something else.

"
"

  Vivo Y91i (Ocean Blue, 2GB RAM, 32GB Storage) Is A Excellent Product And Battery Life Is Also Very Awesome & Camera Quality Is Also Very Excellent.

"
"

  In such a Price segment...a decent product for moderate users who use smartphones for just light entertainment purpose, mailing, Whatsapp ,net surfing, the, etc. battery takes a very long time to full charge, but backup is very good.

"
"

  Good battery backupChamera quality not so good but ok

"
"

  Overall it worth and value for money as within affordable budgeted segment.Camera quality a bit low as not what to be expected. But overall performance wise best  deal.

"
"

  the display is not ips panel...colours and viewing angles are not up to mark.camera performs poor too...may be because the screen displays poor contrast ...the overall result and answer is no to this.go for other options Redmi 7 , realme C2 in this price bracket

"
"

  Phone is very good at this range only problem is slow charging.  If they have provided finger print then it will of more worthy.  But it's really good at this range.

"
"

  Nice piece

"
"

  Great product @ Very economical price.

"
"

  Good for camera but overall performance wise work for daily life style with just calling n normal fb insta use but for watching movie or games would recommend for another phone due to graphics quality and screen

"
"

  Love this one

"
"

  Very poor processor. Most of d time mobile is in hang cond. Very poor quality pbone.

"
"

  This Phone is Worst that I ever had till now, it keeps switched off for every one hour and phone is not updating at all.  DONT Ever buy from this seller. I don't like to give that one star rating also, but an option to give this feedback review I have to give that one star which I don't like to give.ThanksRaji

"
"

  Best phone for battery and camera

"
"

  My sister is using this mobile,Mobile is not working since 10 days,no voice is recognized to caller or receiver,not value for money,kindly send service centre details at Gandhidham(Gujarat)

"
"

  it is ok value for money working also good I purchased last month working smoothly as of know

"
"

  Good phone in the price range

"
"

  It's a nice mobile phone with awspme display and good functions.It has a very good camera and the mobile performance is amazing.I am very pleased to used vivo Y91.It's performance of ram is good and the looks of thos phone is so amazing.It has a better bettery performance.

"
"

  Battery life is superb, camera quality is ok within the budget it's a good deal to go for. Only challenge with my phone is speaker sometimes doesn't work dont know why but yes facing only this challenge. Headphones missing not sure if it's a part of general kit or not as per listing.

"
"

  Thank's to amazon very easy exchange process. Where flipcart is doing too much drama for exchange. Also the mobile is very good seal pack box i recived ,everything is fine.

"
"

  There is no option for finger print reader apart from that Accessability, camera, face recognition, interfacing between apps seems good. I love the phone

"
"

  Overall the product is good...Functions very well without any pause. Touch is good. camera quality is also good.However it takes around 2 hours to completely charge. Fast charging would have made it better. Worth product by Vivo under such range

"
"

  Everything is wrong in this. Totally I'm disappointed 😔😔☹️

"
"

  Please Don't Buy 2gb Variant It's Very Lagging It Need For Just Using You Can Buy 2gb Variant For Gaming It's Crashing In the First Week It's Good But After Two Weeks It's Very Lagging And Auto Exit Waste Of My Money It's Not Exchanging 😭😭 For Gaming Go For 3Gb Variant

"
"

  There is no ear phone in the vivo box only phone and charger is there. There is no ear phone lead in the vivo box.

  Battery life is amazing, looks are beautiful in this price the best buy. I was using iphone earlier, found most of the features there in my VIVO.

"
"

  Third class phoneCamera is very bad . Speaker sound is very third class. Not better than red mi or oppo

"
"

  Charger is very slow. Takes more than 3 hours to charge the phone fully. Abd display is not crisp.

"
"

  Good product

"
"

  Not a bad choice in this price segment

"
"

  *No finger print unlock available in this device.*Camera quality is average.*Battery life is good.*Face unlock is qutie good.*

"
"

  Product has issue and I want to return but amazon arrange trouble shooting.That technician found issue but still I am not able to return

"
"

  It's good. Decent battery life and camera quality is fine.

  Super Mobile at 8k price. Everything is ok. But it doesn't have finger print reader has it mentioned in the product description. Happy with this product.

"

  I purchase this phone from the amazon around one year ago. It is very good in use. no complain am happy this product thank you so much amazon.

"
"

  This mobile phone talking time evry call very cojection not completely talking

"

  Worth every penny. Color is devine. Loved the phone a lot must buy in this price range. Thank you amazon

"

  This is very good phone in this budget...what a great performance...I am reviewing after use of one day full time I don't give me rest..but still its performance very good.....

"
"

  Just 5 days after using software problem and charging issues..

  Good phone, worth for price.  I suggest to buy this one because basically all the smartphone life is maximum 3 to 4 years.. So it's a good one for the cost

  Before buying you must know the difference between 7k mobile and 10k to 15K Mobiles .Reason for choosing this title earlier i used a pro version model , Now i am reviewing this model after 3 days of usage.1. Ear speaker quality in outdoor's very poor  . Keep your headphones handy ,2.Sensor's are not working properly ( this is the reason i choose this title , sensor quality is based on price )3.App search option is not available  , you must be very patient to search required app when you have an urgent need , you have to swipe all your mobile to choose required app . or change the launcher . default launcher is not capable of doing this basic function .Rest all other functions are good  .

"
"

   Worst phone ever. Don't buy ths phone.heating issue at the bottom side of touch screen, touch button as well as ghost touch activates on its own within 1-2 minutes and you can not use any of the app properly.Initially thought it may be a due to some kind of virus, even after company reset issue is there and also you can see screen flickering very easily.

"
"

  This is my 4th MI Phone in 3 years. Earlier ones were good.But here The extra battery has made phone heavier and hence has lost it charm, now looks like chinese phone. Earlier ones were as good as other phone apart from brand.Not recommended.Would love to return but it was gift for family,

"
"

  I bought this for an older relative who needed a basic smartphone. Given its pricepoint I didn't have much expectations for the Redmi 8A but after unboxing and setting it up I have to admit - it looks and behaves like a premium phone!In almost every aspect 8A has been upgraded over the 7A. While it doesn't have a fingerprint sensor, the camera is much better than I expected. There is a bit of lag in opening and switching between multiple applications but it shouldn't be a big deal for people with basic usage patterns. To facilitate better grip, 8A has a non-glassy back that is textured. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by the phone given its pricepoint. For its target demographic (light users who might just want to take some pics, use social media and the occasional app) this is a great phone.The only drawback I felt is that Xiaomi has been aggressive in bundling custom apps in the phone that deliver lots of ads and sponsored videos by default (and it requires some know-how to disable them).

"
"

  Mobile is good at this priceBut when I was using hotspot and screen recording the mobile became overheated it hanged so i switch off it.In this range mobile is really good..

Ear speaker quality in outdoor's very poor  . Keep your headphones handy ,2.Sensor's are not working properly ( this is the reason i choose this title , sensor quality is based on price )3.App search option is not available  , you must be very patient to search required app when you have an urgent need , you have to swipe all your mobile to choose required app . or change the launcher . default launcher is not capable of doing this basic function .Rest all other functions are good  .

   Worst phone ever. Don't buy ths phone.heating issue at the bottom side of touch screen, touch button as well as ghost touch activates on its own within 1-2 minutes and you can not use any of the app properly.Initially thought it may be a due to some kind of virus, even after company reset issue is there and also you can see screen flickering very easily.

  This is my 4th MI Phone in 3 years. Earlier ones were good.But here The extra battery has made phone heavier and hence has lost it charm, now looks like chinese phone. Earlier ones were as good as other phone apart from brand.Not recommended.Would love to return but it was gift for family,

  I bought this for an older relative who needed a basic smartphone. Given its pricepoint I didn't have much expectations for the Redmi 8A but after unboxing and setting it up I have to admit - it looks and behaves like a premium phone!In almost every aspect 8A has been upgraded over the 7A. While it doesn't have a fingerprint sensor, the camera is much better than I expected. There is a bit of lag in opening and switching between multiple applications but it shouldn't be a big deal for people with basic usage patterns. To facilitate better grip, 8A has a non-glassy back that is textured. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by the phone given its pricepoint. For its target demographic (light users who might just want to take some pics, use social media and the occasional app) this is a great phone.The only drawback I felt is that Xiaomi has been aggressive in bundling custom apps in the phone that deliver lots of ads and sponsored videos by default (and it requires some know-how to disable them).

  Mobile is good at this priceBut when I was using hotspot and screen recording the mobile became overheated it hanged so i switch off it.In this range mobile is really good..

"
"

  We are highly unsatisfied with the product .There is performance issue with the phone in which the touch ,speed as well as the processor is very slow.It does not worth the money and the sound quality is also low.The battery also gets drained very early though it is of 5000 mAH.We have mailed a return request but they have not taken any action.I need to return this phone and want a new phone as soon as possible.

"
"

  The phone hangs a lot. Processor is too slow. Apps close on their own. Can't ecen listen yo music continuously.

  Defective display (minor scratch) on the scratch and there is now way i can return / service / request replacement.

  Top smartphone in this priceEXCELLENCE camera , great display

"
"

  I purchased this phone in Feb. 2020  from Amazon site and now it's May 2020 and  I find it difficult to swipe it open after the display goes on sleep mode.  So this is the status it's touch mechanism within 3 months.  So one has to be careful about buying cheap quality Redmi phones as the touch mechanism may not be of good quality..

"
"

  Nice design,heavy, gr8 display size , camera quality poor, battery capacity excellentGood price for these features

"
"

  Phone is good, no finger print reader, but price is disappointingBecause it is launched at a price of 6499 now see the price

"
"

  The phone has many pros and some cons.The cons are :Speaker sound is not that good.Sound with bluetooth headphone ,earphone is not good.Equalizer can not be used in case of bluetooth headsets, earphones.There should be a 4 ,64 gb variant.There are some MI apps which can not be uninstalled.Camera is ok, medium quality.

"

   From 12 the day it is not working. Mi service center re installed the software but still it is not working

  Redmi 8A Dual (Sea Blue, 3GB RAM)Battery: The smartphone comes with a 5000 mAH battery. For an average user, this is great.OS: The preinstalled OS Android 9 with MIUI Global 11.0.2. user interface.OS Volume Bug: There is a bug which constantly causes volume to drop to zero. You can fix this bug by System Update.Camera: Pretty decent camera. There are already too many reviews on this, so I'm not gonna comment.Bloatware: Probably, this is what bugs me most in android devices. There are bunch of preinstalled apps and games. Most of them are unnecessary for you. You can remove most of them but not all. This is pathetic.RAM Usage: After removing bloatwares, the system takes around 1.1 GB of RAM, so you will have 1.9 GB of RAM which is enough for the most users.No Heating Issue: I'm not a gamer, but if you are an average you will not find any heating issue, at least most of the time.

"

  I was purchased Redmi 8A on.  19/02/2020,  but received phone is defective,  i was already registered my complain, but Amazon not postive response.

"
"

  I wasted my money on this phone,Phone hang a lot and all functions start working automatically and iam not able to restart the phone. So at that time I have to wait for 20 30mints.I demand product replacement or refund plz.

  I was a little sceptical while purchasing this phone as it was my first Chinese phone as I was fed up with my mom's rough phone usage! She successfully killed many good brand phones like HTC, Samsung etc so wanted something really cheap this time. I paid 7500 for this phone even though the old price was 6500! Due to lockdown, I had no option to roam around! The best part was I got 3100Rs for old Samsung J4 in exchange with no mess, whereas local shopkeepers were talking about 1k resale value lol! That was less than year old phone though but still, I was happy with buyback price so went ahead and decided to buy this phone even though there are plenty of negative reviews!Now coming to the phone I didn't feel like I'm holding some entry-level Chinese phone! It's a great phone for ladies who use phone just for WhatsApp and calling. No problems found so far. The battery is excellent. Colour is catchy. The best part is Type C slot as all other phones in my home have Type C! Best phone for basic users. Not for Pro. I own LG G7, Oneplus etc so I know what premium means! So I won't call it premium but it's definitely worth a try! Consider the life of a couple of years and proceed as even branded entry-level phones die sooner or later. It's been only 2 days so can't say much about it. If there seems to be any problem I'll update my review.

"
"

  Pros:*Cool battery*Type c charger and fast charging*Corning Gorilla glass 5(toughness)*Splashproof*Wireless FMCons:*Too many pre-installed unwanted apps which would kill internal storage and ram space*No private safe, but covered with second space. (Hide option is provided for folder as a whole, not for individual file/image. That too without password protection!! Too bad*processor performance is not great but good.*presence of Finger print sensor would be great*Both the cameras are too bad.. would feel like having 5 mp camera.*Weights heavy due to 5k battery

   My review for Seller Appario :2nd ViDEO :DEFECTIVE PIECE: Mobile is misbehaving... suddenly clicking on any/many app... ""WITHOUT TOUCHING ON SCREEN""... suddenly opening Gmail... suddenly opening SMS and start typing... very sad...

  Missing fingerprint sensor but nice phone with nice design

"
"

  I bought this phone for my dad.Pros:good battery lifelarge screenlook and feel is nicecamera is good for its priceCons:THIS HANDSET IS MADE IN CHINAI thought it is Redmi (made in India), but it is made by Xiomi.Does not have fingerprint scanner.

"
"

  It is fantastic phone for you if you are a normal user and not  a gamer . But unfortunately I received the handset is defective (I dont know that other have faced it or not) . In some app like BHIM UPI it shows the device is rooted. You can not oparate may app in rooted device . So please make sure that if your device same problem . If yes then mark my review as helpful. Thak me latter.

  Service is good but........

"
"

  Cons:1. Very bad camera. Selfie camera is not even enough for video calling.2. Performance is not up to mark with 3gb RAM.3. Heating problem with extensive usage of internet or gaming.4. Many unnecessary apps which cannot be removed are impacting performance.Pros:1. Very good battery life.2. Nice display and well built.3. Budget phone.Overall, it is a budget smartphone with less smartness. Lot of notifications which are unable to remove with many unnecessary apps in OS.

"
"

  Cons: No fingerprint sensor.No Widevine L1 support.Not a good camera at all. Photos captured are blurry and unclear. Totally disappointed with the camera.Too many MI built in apps which reduces the usable memory in hand.Pros: Premium quality design.Feels good in hand.Corning Gorilla Glass 5.Type C port.Fast charging.Dedicated Memory Card slot expandable upto 512 GB.Super Class Audio Speakers. Sound is very good. Listening music is very much enjoyable.Not heating up while charging.Display not bad at all.All in all a good phone at this price range.

"
"

  I have purchased 8A dual but its not a good product ,i have buy many product from amazon but i havent recevied such a bab product these phone camera is not good & get blink any while opening app..& phone get swtich off..while video call camera is not stable i request you to change the product & refund the money asap...i m not happy with this product..these issue i m facing from 1 month..

"
"

  When I receive this item it was 63% charge then I put charge after two hours it get only 68% only then I put whole night charge next day morning it get only 80% charge.. I totally disappointed..After that I returned this item then I received new mobile when I opened I directly put into charge, I get the same issue I don't what a do.. what they are doing I don't know they not checks properly and not inspected.. I really upset this service..

"
"

  In this price segment this is the worst mobile I have used yet. Camera is above average not best, there is a big issue in this phone is network and wifi connection issue.Phone automatically disconnected wifi connection all the time and network is also very weak comparing to other mobiles. One big issue I found today that touch is working automatically. And there is another problem with Amazon to replace the phone that now I have to post the phone to Amazon then they will send a new phone.Third class performance

"
"

  First  of  all I would like to say,""IT IS THE BEST PHONE UNDER ₹10,000""....*GOOD Selfie and Rear cameras at this price.*FAST CHARGING*GOOD PERFORMANCE*STYLISH EXTERNAL DESIGNS*BEST SPEAKERS*BEST FOR PLAYING GAMES LIKE FREEFIRE ,PUBG etc...(but You should play with Standard Graphics otherwise occurs a heating issue )*NO FINGERPRINT FACILITY*NO EARPHONES AVAILABLE WITH THE PHONE*PREVENT THE DEVICE FROM RUNNING IN LOW SPACE other wise There will be a Lag iSsue..

"
"

  First off all it is a good product for this price. Good looking and smooth. But..The camera is too cheap that it is a waste having dual camera for this quality. May be it's software issue.And IT LACK A FINGER PRINT SENSORbut HAVE FACE UNLOCK INSTEAD,it is pretty good.The phone is LITTLE BIT BULKY may be because of 5000mAh battery pack.Anyway it's is good as a budget phone

"
"

  The phone comes with a 6.22-inch touchscreen display with a resolution of 720x1520 pixels and an aspect ratio of 19:9. The Redmi 8A Dual runs Android 9.0 and is powered by a 5000mAh battery.The phone is a bit heavier though compare to the other ones. And sometimes it gets over heated.Overall, it's an affordable phone with a very reasonable amount of money.

"
"

  Defective product received as with many other users. The phone has ghost touch problem. This seems to be the issue with this phone model and also in general with Redmi phones as is apparent from several online forums. Since I only noticed this problem after the return period was over, Amazon wasn't ready to extend any support on this. The problem has only aggravated since and the phone now dials numbers  or opens apps on its own. For the first time in my life, I have faced a hardware issue with a brand new phone. Redmi QC seems to be very lax. Now I need to take it to the service centre. It is really annoying to send a new product for servicing and be left without a phone after spending your hard earned money.

"
"

  Excellent mobile to use... Bought for my father and he loved it as he starts to use it.Big battery lasts longer.Excellent display, vibrant colours presentation, nice photos and videos, up to the mark... Thanks Amazon for perfect package and delivery on time.From company side in the box, No screen guard and no mobile pouch provided.

"
"

  • Camera Quality is acceptable (Don't expect much quality).• Not a gaming processor. (Snapdragon 439)• No fingerprint reader.• Face Unlock is present.• Out of the box type-c charger is present.• Correct fit in hand.• Gives a good inhand feel.• We can play some heavy games in it (PUBG is included).• Excellent Display.• Dual 4G support is there.• 2.5 hours charging time (20% to 100%).

"
"

  The mobile phone is best option for those user that needs good battery backup. Beautiful looking mobile. Type C charging port but charger supplied with this mobile is 2 mAh type C Charger.

"
"

  It's working fineBest phone in this rangeLooking for I was looking for a phone under 8000 for my younger brother as he was having very tight budget so I search many phone went to market in the market offline this phone was being sold about 8500 but I got on Amazon in 7500 only you can see it is available on Flipkart another platform over 8000Other alternative of his phone in the same range having low quality processor and no gorilla glass screen c type charging in this range you cannot find anywherePhone has premium looks

"
"

  1. Battery Life is Good - Lasted for 1.5 days on one charge2. Full Charge took 1 Hour which is ok for 5000 MAH Battery3. Mobile is a little heavier due to battery4. The phone did not heat up though used continuouslyGood Buy at the offered priceImprovement Areas1. AI Camera is not that fast2. Already MI Security Patch is released and takes 1.7 GB of data for update, No problem for wifi users but heavy on cellular networks3. Lot of adds and push notifications, Disable them4. Camera Quality fair enough for this Price, Dont expect super trendy clarity5. Always notifies to update the built in apps all the time, they will work though not updated.

  Best budjet smartphone from redmiIt worth my money Excellent smartphone 👍🔥💥Thank you Amazon and XioamiThe most interesting thing is you get 5000 mh battery in this budjet.But redmi should add fingerprint scanner in this smartphoneBut overall the phone is Good

"
"

  Great phone and you will get all the high end phone trending (gestures, raise to wake, dark mode and much more) customizations with miui11.People who are not willing to spend a fortune on the devices can easily upgrade to this one.For daily usage beats all categories.Love it.

"

  Placed for return! Still not sure when my return will be processed! Amazon Customer service is closed!The adapter of charger DIDNT WORKSOFTWARE FAILURE IS THERE! Identified and reported the very next day of purchase!

  My mom’s been using this for around a month now. It looks great, and found no issues yet.Tbh, display is too big. If you like big screen phones then go for it. Go for the 3GB RAM version, since 2GB one is too slow.Display: 5/5 (No issues at all)Sound: 3.5/5 (It’s loud but not that great)Camera: 3.5/5 (Dual cameras but photos are not at good)Battery: 5/5 (My mom doesn’t use it that much, so battery lasts up to 3-4 days easily)Quality: 5/5 (It’s plastic but the built is nice)Overall: 4/5 (Works out great for my mom at this price. Satisfied)

  Bought this for my father who is 75 years old, suggested by my son who is 15 years old. Both of them are impressed for different reasons. Father, for the light weight and non-slippery hold, son, for the speed, camera quality and sturdiness. I am happy because it is value for money. Overall, a great deal for first time users.

"
"

  This is one of the cheap smartphone according to its features.Battery capacity is amazingCamera is ok not so good.Two things I dislike about this Phone that it is made in China not only mobile, adapter is also made in China and the second thing is 10w charger is given in this box we have to purchase separately.Sound quality is clear and too lound I liked this also.Overall I like this Phone.Note: We have to use invoice as a warrenty card to claim our warrentybecause Warrenty Card is not separately given inside the box. So I request the seller to give invoice in good condition to customers because I have not received invoice in good condition.  (For those customers who have written ""Warrenty Card is not given"" in their review and for the seller).Hope this will help.Thank you.

  I purchased Redmi 8A Dual on 27th July 2020. It has 7 days return policy. After 15 days the phone was switched off automatically and after several trying phone did not power on. I go to the redmi authorized service center for servicing of the mobile phone. They tell me that the phone was water damaged. Due to this I did not get any warranty. But they did not open the mobile in front of me for checking.  Worst quality of phone I ever seen and worst quality of service center they have.

"
"

  Not a good product. Took it to service center. First they changed software. But again started to hang. Requested for replacement, but not getting replacement during warranty. I purchased this because of its high rating and it looks amazon rating is fake.

"
"

  I ordered this phone on behalf of a relative and she confirmed tht the battery last only 2-3 hours.When she went to MI service centre, they said tht they cannot replace the phone because it is bought on Amazon and Amazon should replace it. Some nonsense.They have finally agreed to replace the battery.please be careful buying Mi Phones.

"
"

  I bought it on 13 jul 20 and from last 10 days I am having a huge problem like battery is getting down very fast, phone is getting hanged again and again. When sometime someone is calling me my phone screen is getting totally black. Messages are sometimes been shown in dragbox but when I am touching it or finding it in inbox it is invisible. I am totally hopeless that what I have bought. Total waste of money.

"
"

  A good dual camera phone in this price range. Battery is 5,000 mah, but performs like 4,000 mah. Camera is good. The best thing is its screen. A nice 6.2"" inch display. Similar to most high value mobiles from this same brand. This sky white colour is best among three. A perfect budget phone till date.

"
"

  Posting reviews after using it for 1 month:Cheap quality intarnal materials used ex. Camera sensor, bluetooth, etc.Realized after experiencing following unexpected problems:- screen hanging- bluetooth not connecting now, earlier connecting when it was- leaves the marks/shadow of the icons/screen elements used in previous applications or even after accessing the contacts or any content.- mobile charger gets heated up like anything after 5-10 min of chargingQuality getting cheaper as the number of users increasing. Company only eye on maximizing the profits. That's what the conclusion is.

"
"

  Exactly once 10 days over for replacement 11 th day phone display goes off. Went to service centre asked for replacement they said nit possible done change of display of some other model and given much dissatisfied from this purchase.

"
"

  I think mobile delivered to me today is defective and not in working condition.So it is surprised like a reputed E_Com , Amazon India doing this type of delivery.it hampers your name and fame.please file a case or written compaint to your seller.

  Redmi 8A Dual 3gb 32gb..Mobile average performance..Not available Fingerprint Reader..Battery life performance also average 5000Mah Battery not going full 2 day with normal usage..Camera quality is also average not upto mark..No slow motion video.. not more option..And main thing so many adds on apps unnecessary  getting notifications...Totaly average performance..But good thing is this mobile getting USB TYPE C & Fast Charging Support is available...

"
"

  I had this Smartphone for my mother. Now after using it about 15 days , I can assure you that Xiaomi has arranged a great deal , but by the time passes new Smartphones will be it's competitors. So remember it's time and current scenario I can completely recommend you to buy this phone if your budget is below 10k .I had ordered 3gb+32gb sea blue variant and got delivered within 5 days , thanks to Amazon. The phone supports 18 watt fast charging and has 5000 mah battery and face unlock , which are unexpected in this price range. But Snapdragon 439 processor is not eligible to do any hard work . I would recommend to use this phone for basics.

"
"

  Important tip: Buy 3GB version to run free fire and other apps without any lags (Available Ram 2 GB/3GB).●Mobile is very good without any lags till now. (using Messenger, Whatsapp, gaana app simultaneously).●Don't buy this mobile for playing high config games. Processsor and graphics hardware are of average quality.●The battery is huge in this mobile. Charging with realme 20W charger took around 2 hours (10% to 95%).●The front and back camera is good in this price segment, and don't expect a quality like 15k mobiles.●The screen comes with a corning gorila 5, with no extra thin screen protector which other phones has.●Face unlock is good but sometimes doesn't work in low light. That is completely ok in 8k mobile.●Now the main thing which I don't like on this phone is useless apps which can't be uninstall. (like MiPay, MI secure vault, etc MI apps). And we can't trust these apps as government banned many MI apps because Xiomi read  and store every activity you do with those apps. So only use google apps to secure data and personal details. BTW it is still not reliable because MI11 OS also can read all your data. Some MI apps has own T&Cs which no one reads before opening. So use Xiomi phones carefully and don't store any banks information or passwords.

"

  It's not called grey colour... If there is no stock of the required colour,it should be shown to the customer... Should not just give any colour you have.That's the problem,but this colour too is not bad.

  I have upgraded from 7a to 8a, this series was released just three months after the earlier version.The battery🔋 which is 5000mah doesn't seem to be showing lot of difference from the 4000mah on the previous 7a. The only negative being the weight of the phone is a little heavier than the previous one. The blue color looks great but the phone is not easy to hold, you have to add back cover with a grip.Camera is good but the front camera has a lot of AI in it. When I took a picture with the back and front camera, the front looked too bright with a lot of brightness.Call quality is very good and it sounds almost like Nokia quality. Videos look good.  I have dropped my old phone a few times with absolutely no damage to body or phone function. I don't use the face lock so can't comment

"
"

  The phone does not boot up. I am not sure what quality check has gone into the product. unfortunately I was not able to return the product on time and the return window got lapsed. Now I am running at the MI brand store to get the product replaced. I spoke with amazon customer care and the seller and they were not willing to replace the product as it got out of the window. What good is a phone if it does not even boot up, What quality testing was done on the phone. Worst exp with amazon and with the seller. I was asking them for replacement as I could not ope n the product on time due to medical issues.

Network seems okay so far!I still wonder why don't we get an EDGE to EDGE DISPLAY  & why REDMI LOGO had to be down there. Besides why did they had to come out with shady hue (Sky White, Midnight Grey & Sea Blue) versions, & why not just simple sleek 'Black or White' . They could have been more simple though, i don't seem if the design at the rear does any wonders or is  wow factor..Thanks to Amazon!

"
"

  The phone is good for the average user. I can say the one who needs streaming apps, whatsApp, Facebook and similar other app will love the phone. Everything is as per expectation. Would have surely liked the product if it was made in India. The model I received is Made in China. Battey backup is good. I am not into much of camera but it comes with 13MP which is good from business point of view.Face recognition is working 7/10 times. No fingerprint scensor. But it's okay for few people like us. Storage is more than enough with 53GB. And 3 GB RAM works well with all apps I mentioned.

"
"

  Defective product. Started auto shutoff and on after just completion of return date. I have purchased it on 12th July 2020. Problem started from 25th July and surprisingly 24th July was last date to return. Very much disappointed. I am purchasing so many products from Amazon. They should check thoroughly before delivering at the cost of their reputation.

"
"

  This is the third Xiaomi product I'm purchasing but this time I'm highly disappointed. 8A phone is no different than Redmi 7A except that this is quite bulky to hold and has better battery life and comes with a C-type charger. Redmi 7A is a lot better than 8A in terms of design. Don't go for the Blue coloured one of 8A, cos it has a funny shade than what's seen in the pictures. Camera claims to have 13mp lens but has no quality of even an 8mp Samsung phone. Also has poor settings with so much beautifying filter which makes everything look so lighter in shade, polished and cartoon like. Xiaomi used to deliver top notch quality phones and camera at the same price range when they launched phones during 2015-16 time period. Xiaomi is compromising a lot on camera quality. The touch response of the handset i received is slow. Also they're refusing to return the product and instead they're giving me a replacement of the same phone which I don't want. When we contacted the Amazon customer care they're asking us to place the return after accepting the second replacement. Why this complication when you can return the first right away than make everyone take double risk of travel in this time of pandemic.

"

  I take online classes so video and voice must be clear. The mobile should be slim and light weight to put on tripod.  I needed a rough and tough high performance phone within my budget constraints.C type charging pin means long pin life. Battery backup is superb, Speaker sound is quite loud, slim body and vibrant colours look smart. Camera is more than enough to fulfill my need as an amateur photographer.Display and handling is quite good. Normal apps work smoothly and I don't use phone for gaming. WhatsApp, Facebook, youtube, etc work well and 64GB Storage with 3GB RAM is more than enough for me.

"
"

  Pros:1.Great Battery Backup.2. The display quality is good.3. The processor is powerful enough for daily tasks not for gaming.4. The only phone with Type-C charging port under 10k, supports fast charging.Cons:1. No fingerprint reader.2. Pre-installed Bloatware.3. Normal charger instead of a fast charger.4. Average camera: Good in daylight(Use Gcam for best results).Overall a decent phone for a college student, Family members.

"

  It's a great phone in low budget. If you are looking a low budget phone then you will go for it. It will provide you fully satisfaction.ProsBattery life is awesome.Build quality is good.Display is also very good in this price range.ConsIt does not have finger lock sencer.Face lock is slow but ok in this price range.Back cover in unavilable in the box.If you find my review helpful then like it guys

  Its average phone and disappointed with Amazon as they havent mentioned country of origin as China

"

  Writing this review after using this device for 2 months.Delivery was super fast (Delivered in just 2 days)..Pros :-1. Big Display (This 6'22"" display is really good for day to day usage).2. Battery & Charging - 5000 mAH battery lasts upto 2 to 2½ days for a normal usage and this supports 18w fast charger and also have USB Type-C cable which is excellent in this price range.3. Look & Feel - This entry level smartphone have a polycarbonate back which is decent and have a good grip..., And it also have Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protection in the front.4. Face Unlock feature - This smartphone doesn't have fingerprint sensor but have a face Unlock which is quite reliable and works well..Cons :-1. Processor - They should have gone for Snapdragon 450 or 460, SD439 is old processor.2.  Bloatwares - There are adds in this device & also have few bloatwares like Mi Community & Helo App which are banned by Indian Government..Overall this is a good upgrade from Redmi 7A at this price range..If you want an entry level smartphone this one is good.

  This is a great product under the 10k range..personally loved it.Though it doesn't have finger print sensor its beautifully designed and can be used.. i've bought this for my father n he loves it.. battery life is 5000mah which is huge and camera quality is good for this range. . so you can definitely give a try

"
"

  The phone is beautifully designed, including the patterned plastic back and the dewdrop notch design. the battery life is good but it could be better but since it's miui,there isn't much you can get apart from ads in the UI which are hard to turn off,there's a lot of invasive bloatware and adware,also the camera quality is average,there was no need for a dual cam setup(I feel the lower camera can be fake),the front cam is average too,I think should've gone with the 9i. Also, there's no screen protector or cover in box

   Bought  a new redmi dual 8A through Amazon .There is a technical issue with this handset.its functioning on it's own .various screen and key pad functions start functioning without even touching the handset.Amazon is not willing  to replace the handset. What a waste of money

  I have got a defective product today I pluged earphone but it didn't work than I thought the ear phone is faulty I tried new one but this didn't work too. Then I tried both earphone on another phone these were working.And returning period is also over but the good thing is I rarely use earphone but when I tried earphone today first time and found the product is faulty I have got a lot of anger but it was my mistake too that I didn't check it in starting days.Ya, but it worthy to be criticized.Instead of this sometimes it's touch do not respond instantly, I have got this problem later.

  Everything is good in mobile but processor is little bit slow(if u r a game user not recommended). Also if u use many applications simultaneously then mobile will go slow.Some how I disappointed that chinese applications is still in there by default and you can't uninstall them,such as mi browser,mi music, mi pay, cleanmaster, mi video, xiaomi wheather etc. Chinese applications is banned in india and company xiaomi india also remove all these Chinese applications.Overall recommended if u r not a heavy user battery backup is good and type-c charger  which support 18watt fast charging is the only pros of this mobile.

  Fingerprint sensor is not available, face unlock feature is available, value for money phone for this price range , I exchanged with my old HTC device ,it costs me around 6299 Rs for 2GB variant , built quality is good, feels solid in hand , sky white colour looks pretty decent and beautiful in hand, cannot expect a good gaming  performance from this device, tried playing Pubg lite & Free fire, not suitable for gamming. Best part is battery back up & USB Type C charging port with fast charging options available. Not satisfied with the face unlock feature. Can be considered as a good option for secondary handset, overall a value for money product.

  Product is working slowly. Keyboard not working properly. Was trying to return the product, showing is not eligible. Product was delivered on 4th March. Within a month all these issues are coming up. Feeling really bad.

"
"

  I have read the reviews before buying the mobile. So thought to give it a luck. After using for 1 day the mobile screen keep on touching itself from any part of the screen. The phone hangs a lot. Pubg runs good at times but a lot of time it lags. I checked the battery performance in setting, the screen itself consuming more than 94% of battery which makes battery drain rapidly. I have replaced it. Now got a replacement with tampered mobile box. However the packing was not tempered. To my surprise it is a used mobile. Fingerprint of former user was found on mobile screen and charger. The mi seal was broken and re-pasted and delivered to me. The seller think himself oversmart. Keep distributing used mobile to the customers. I have checked this mobile condition which is good at outside but the internet connectivity is very poor it does not go beyond 350kb at 2am midnight Jio 4G. Which goes beyond 2Mbps at this time in other mobile phone. Also charger is heated up when charging within 20 minutes and it's not 18W power charger. So i got a defective used product in replacement.  Now i  want my refund. I am not satisfied with this mobile. The conclusion is that if you are lucky enough than this mobile will work for a few day until replacement period is over or maximum 15 days later you will repent at your choice. Better put 1-2k more and get better mobile than this Redmi 8A Dual 3-32.

  The Budget BeastNo words to describe the new Redmi 8A especially its stunning look ... amazing display with water drop notch looks premium. This design is seen only in 15 k segment from Samsung where Xiaomi did it.Awesome cameraI have used 4A & 7A but comes to 8A its totally changed in camera. Its AI powered camera gives excellent output even in low light conditions  worth it...oooohIncredible Battery but not hulky5000 mAh class leading battery gives approximate two days of normal use without charging twice. Not much bulky in hand and weight is optimized!!!!! wowperformance is out of the worldGames, movies, chatting, shooting no compromise on multitasking Smoothly run by octa core chipset from Snapdragon 439 is excellent at this price point is amazing....octa core at 6K OMG....main disadvantage I have noticed is there is no notification led...

  Battery is okCamera is goodBut missing warranty cardWhy cheated like this fruaders

"
"

  Ok phone. Brought as I got good exchange price of my old phone against purchase of redmi 8a dual. Speed ok. Phone hangs sometimes. Camera ok. Call quality and battery life superb. Display very good for budget phone. One defect. IR blaster is not working on my redmi 8a dual since day one. One irritating this that MI asks permission to store data and track for almost everything we use on this phone. Would rate it ok purchase as I got for only 3000 in exchange of my old phone.

"
"

  Simple smartphone, but Good Smartphone! Camera average but included PRO mode, Battery backup excellent Charged 4 days ago. Used normal internet and Dual 4G native video calling and WiFi Hotspot without gaming till now. Display 6'22"" good, No lag, Good face detection. Overall 9/10 but if you consider the price then it's 10/10 actually.

"
"

  Battery life is good but as it is not fast charging, it takes 3-4 hours to charge completely. It looks really good as well...and so far it's performance has been amazing. Camera is good as well. Overall it's an excellent phone in this price range.But do refer to it's YouTube review as well. All of its features and deficiencies are explained in detail there.

"
"

  In products detailed information it is mentioned, product would be made in India, but why delivered product is made in China. I know company is from China, however I thought product is getting manufactured in India. Please put correct information in product details.

"
"

  - utmost thing is battery backup- camera is too good at good light condition- low light camera is blurry- speakers are good at sound- there is double tap for screen wake- the VoWifi(Voice over WiFi) is available for selected operators- network reception is also good- phone is little bit heavy- it will good if here is LED notificationat last i would say the phone is best value phone from Xiaomi But there UI bugs are ridiculous

"
"

  Good mobile for the price you get. SD439 does the day to day job, definitely gaming is not amongst those. Camera is what you get for the price. The highlight is battery which is absolutely killer. Can easily give a screen on time of 10 plus hrs on mixed usage. Supports fast charging however only 10 watts charger is supplied in the box and,without any headphones which is understandable at this price.

"
"

  Good budget mobile for basic usage like attending online classes, listening to music, watching videos and normal browsing. The limited 2 GB RAM doesn't allow for multitasking and gaming which you obviously can't expect in a phone at this price. The features are really amazing like the p2i coating, Gorilla Glass 5 and wireless FM which makes this a strong and durable phone to have!

"
"

  Did lot of research before buying.At this budget this the best phone I found it in market. I am not big fan of redmi. But it is cost effective and good for short term use.Over all phone is okay don’t expect much .Sound quality is good.Battery life is also good.Have all the required basic features.Camera is not that great if you need good camera dont go for it.Phone is heating while charging.Go for it if it fit in your budget.Overall okay.

  Redmi 8a dual is the worst mobile in the market. The phone has serious lag issues and the home page freezes from time to time. I got a replacement after I complained about lag issues and the second piece turned out to be worst than the first. Now I am stuck with this ""brick"" of a mobile forever. After a complaint about the replacement, Amazon sent a service expert who was unaware of my phone's problem. He came, he saw, he yelled, he blabbered and left telling that the phone is fine according to him and that I have 365 days time to keep visiting the Mi service centre day after day.

  Hello guys,I am using this phone from 8th july. When i Bought it and start using it initially there was issues of automatic brightness of the display, it was getting stuck at particular level and in the bright light you need to manually increase the brightness. but after software update all those issues were resolve but now i am facing phone slow down issue very much. After this much time phone is got slower and slower. if you go to camera it just hung.very very bad ...experience .... earlier i was using note 4 of mi. which is still working very well ...And one should expect better performance from latest gadget .... which is totally missing....I shall not recommend to buy this product....Do not feel bad Mi.......  Please work on it..Thank you.

"
"

  It’s just not worth the money. I have used MI phones earlier and they work fine but this one is useless.1) it’s very slow and if you open multiple app at a time the phone will hang2) Even opening YouTube application on this phone takes close to 8-10 seconds3) Battery is very and will last appx 1 day with normal usage4) lot of ads pop up which is irritating5) Camera is very bad , My earlier MI 5A takes better pictures than this phoneOverall very unhappy with this product.I have been using this since 10 days now.

"
"

  I returned this the third day after delivery.It hanged in my very first use LOL !•Camera is below average.•Processes is average.•It does not have fingerprint reader.•• Hangs when you record video using Snapchat & WhatsApp. (third party apps)Honestly, Even in Rs.8999, you can get much much much much better experience!AND I'M NOT EXAGGERATING.

"
"

  There is one feature of this phone wherein we can tab three times on screen to see zoom view; when I enabled that, I found lagging issue with phone and also screen got freeze some times, with this option face diffuculty to dial a phone when we need to type like 9998 it's my own number series,Camera performance disappoint me; in day lite it's Ok, I can say average, and in night compete zero..""0"", and color capturing is also not good.I am happy with design, that gives rich look, touch is smooth, also allows to delete preinstalled games & other application.It's okay with this price and No cost EMI option.Thank you

"
"

  The phone got slow after one week use, i wanted to replace but the replace window is closed. Camera & battery are average, It's not like 13MP & 5000Mah. The device is not suitable to play any game even ludo, it's started lagging when you open ludo and after shut any from your app your home display become blank for few seconds ...........Worst experience.Dear Amazon team, please help to replace the device.

"
"

  Rear camera quality is below average, main problem is with auto focus, camera is struggling to focus on objects.Wireless display feature problem, wireless display is frequently disconnected with Smart TV.OS become unstable sometimes, need to reboot is the only option to recover the phone.Failed to upgarde on MIUI 11, after complete download of around 2 GB, it fails to update on MIUI 11.

"
"

  निश्चित रूप से रेडमी ने अपने आप को काम कीमत में बेहतर फीचर्स एवम् क्वालिटी मोबाइल कंपनी के रूप में स्थापित किया है परन्तु कॉम्पटीशन के चक्कर में रेड़मी ने सस्ते पार्ट्स इस्तेमाल करना शुरू कर दिया है। यही वजह है कि रेडमी के फोन्स की क्वालिटी घटती जा रही है। Redmi 8a में mike की घटिया क्वालिटी इसका एक नमूना है। मै redmi 8a के 5 से भी ज्यादा फोन में वही same mike problem देख चुका हूं। Vioce क्लियर नहीं आती । Feels like old days chinese mobile phone।प्लीज खरीदने से पहले एक बार किसी भी दूसरे के मोबाइल को इस्तेमाल करके देख लें । Totally disappointed this time

  Bought the phone for my wife when her phone screen was damaged. It was on offer on Amazon at the time and for its price, it seemed like a great deal. Note that the spec says 2GB ram, 32GB storage. Being a Samsung user, i wasn't sure how the experience would be. However i am happy to report that aside from a few hitches, this phone is excellent. The 2GB may seem less but i never noticed any issue when using fb or youtube. I cannot recommend it for intensive gaming but for casual use like watching videos etc, it is fine. I havent tested the selfie cam yet but the front cam is pretty good. There is no fingerprint sensor. Even though the phone supports fast charging, there is no fast charger provided. No earphones. Basically just the phone and regular charger. Ensure you remove the preinstalled bloatware and banned chinese software. Finally an excellent 5000 mAh battery that lasts almost a whole day on active use. All in all, a phone perfect for the casual user.

"
"

  Ordered it for my mother. Good phone for her but for average user it is not that good.Cons:Phone keep hanging if multitasking done like opening of 2 or more apps at same time.Battery life is also not so good.Built Quality and finishing is not good.Pros:SnapDragon processor at this range.Handy phone.

"
"

  Nice phone, as expected. Only negative side is that it belongs to a Chinese company and a part of our payment will reach the Chinese (though made in India).Only Sub 10K price range phone with snapdragon processor and 64GB phone memory.Phone don't have fingerprint unlock, but have face unlock.Battery lasts for 2 days for average normal use (calls, social media and youtube, without gaming)Camera also good, with decent portrait mode with background blur and all the gimmicks.All in all a good budeget phone.Still i am a little upset that i supported the Chinese (even though indirectly)

"
"

  First I ordered this mobile on 6th July and got it on 9th july(2020). There was 3.5 mm jack issue with this mobile and I ordered for it's return.Again I got a new mobile on 13th July but I can return my mobile till 20th July.On 22nd July I faced another issues with this new mobile. Apps opening and closing itself. Nither I can close my app nor I can switch off mobile. For example if I'm surfing fb then it suddenly get closed and suddenly open. Even mobile automatically start typing in comment box.So I just want to tell you pls don't go for this mobile.

  I purchased this product only cause my one plus was broke and I couldn’t get it repaired on time. I needed a spare phone for emergencies and I bought this product considering the cost factor. I’ve never used any of RedMi products and since RedMi claim that they are the products for cost I wanted to give it a try. As I expected, it’s the worst performance phone. I’m not talking about the performance equal to a premium smartphone. I’m talking about basic use. The touch is worse. It taps automatically and makes the usage of phone a nightmare. Have to restart it multiple times to fix that issue temporarily. U never know when the same error occurs. Other than that, major thing is “THE DEVICE TURNS OFF ALL OF SUDDEN FROM NOWHERE AND WONT TURN ON AT ANY COST”. Nobody knows why that happened and will have to factory reset the device from device factory mode. Will never buy any of the RedMi products just because of price. I’d rather get a good quality product even if I have to pay a little more money.I’d not recommend at all be it any product coming from this company.

  Lots of useless manufacturer and google apps. You open the box and it feels like you're using someone else's phone. Additionally, they cant be uninstalled. Hogs up 14 GB of 32 GB space and you're left with only 18 GBs. And if you're using two sims you cant even insert a memory card to store pics/music or whatever.Ads everywhere! You open any of their apps, even the system apps, and adds are there to greet you.Does not come with a fingerprint senser.Battery life is decent but lets see how it works 6 months from now.Has an ugly(imo) screen tint as default. And for some reason, every time I restart I have to set the tint and turn off auto-brightness all over again.  Idk if it's a fault or I am not doing it right.Screen guard and back cover not included in the box as is the norm with some other manufacturers.Comparing it with Honor 8c which I bought last year for roughly the same price (8.3k), this phone's resolution is massively inferior to Honor's even though they both claim it to be 720 x 1520 pixels.Very disappointed and underwhelmed with this purchase. Only keeping it because it was the cheapest phone (among newer releases) in the 32gb/3gb category on amazon. You save your money to buy an entry level phone and still it doesn't feel personalised. Fed up with these proprietary devices. Linux mobile distros cant come soon enough.

  Worst phone I have ever purchased...3 gb ram but lags a lot on full version kine master and other designing apps other. I have tried the trial on two mi 8 phones pic attached of both.. Samsung and Huawei phones with 3 gb are best it was my first mi phone and I m disappointed with this phone. I was using huawei and Samsung 3 gb ram varient and are best till date after more than 2 years of rugged usage. Even micromax 4311 3gb ram is faster than miI suggest to go for Samsung. mi is best for those who have not used Samsung and huawei(including honor) ram and battery management is best in Samsung, micromax and huawei

  Redmi 8a dual is a balanced phone in its price rangeAdvantages...1. Processor is SD2. Display3.build quality4. battery life5. Face unlock6. Type c charging fast chargingDisadvantages...1. Front and rear camera quality is not up to the mark. It is slightly below avg quality. I hope redmi can fix it by software update.2. Picture stabilization is not up to the mark.3. Sound quality should be given slightly better.4. I have big issue with interface miui. There are a lot of adds.5. Some deadly apps come with pre installed. Those garbages should be removed by software update.Overall if you are looking for a low budget phone for your parents usage purpose or child's study purpose, this is the right one battery is larger, processor is good for day to day life usage and display is much better. Face unlock is fast. But redmi should Remove the garbage apps. Overall 4.5 star for the phone below 8k.

  wifi, every 1min disconnects even from 1mtr of router. Raised a complain. Service centre told factory reset. First time facing Such issue. Xiomi you Just lost a customer.Don't want visit considering current covid and  also stories from xiomi services.I gave video, log every thing to them. As I also work in Mobil domain, i know it is defect which they should know.before.

   I dislike the phone because fingerprint reader so poor that after few times it start becomes blur and screen got shake automatically and poor camera quality. My money goes in vain totally rubbish product. Do not buy any chinese because two of my chinese phone working very worst. I am not lying please see the image and video I have uploaded.

"
"

  It's a little hard to use with one hand, and the keyboard doesn't seem to have one-handed mode, but the split screen feature and the screen brightness make up for that. This is the first smartphone I've used where the minimum brightness is satisfactory for use in a dark room. The dark mode and reading mode options are quite helpful, too. The screen is also resistant to damage, to a certain extent. The battery cannot be removed, but there seems to be a fair amount of ingress protection because of that. Lastly, it comes with its own USB-C charging cable, which is a little short but charges well enough.

  I have ordered this product on September 1 and got it on sep 3. After 3 days ,the display stops it's working. The image in these display are now show as multiple images and are floating most of the time. Not even able to read atleast a word properly.Some times it seems normal but most of the time they are not working. I have brought this for my siblings for attending online classes. But this product is absolutely useless. My all other phones are brought from Flipkart and other sites. But none of them are of this kind. All of them are working properly. I thought that the product from Amazon might be having better quality than other sites,but now I think that I was wrong. I lost believe in Amazon. I have contacted the customer service and they told that service exicutive will inspect the phone and then only they can proceed. But I think this is not fair because the executive will reach to my house after two days and after inspection they will decide what to do. I need refund for this item, I will brought product of another company from somewhere else. Or I will file a case in consumer court for this issue against MI and Amazon India for cheating me. I have discussed this with an advocate.

"
"

  It is a basic phone ... If you have money add 2k or 4k and opt for another model.( Phone supports manily  for children and elder parent )Redmi note 8 or pocco m2* Positives *Best at 7.5k* Excellet battery* Good display* Use for online class* Negative ** No finger print ( but at this price range exceptional )* Camera is biggest issue.. I have expected more from rear cam..* Little bit of hang at 2gb ram , go for 3 gb ram ...* Cannot use for hard, not a gaming phone..

"

  I bought this product with exchange, exchanged with old redmi 5. The pick up guy verified the mobile in and out and picked up from home. Surprisingly after one day he called and said glass is broken which we never noticed. And am sure it was not. We cant say what he did in 1 day with mobile. Now asking to return. It is not acceptable, i do not know wht all he did with mobile. If it was broken he could have rejected during pick up. This what i do not like..

"
"

  Phone is a good option in this range.It lacks fingerprint scanner. Camera quality is not so good. It is a very heavy phone,  difficult to keep itnin hands id you are using it for long while lying in bed. But it is worth buying.It has made in india sticker also,  not sure if it is real.

"
"

  At first glance I was happiest person to have bought this phone at Rs 7499  (2GB Ram, 32 GB internal memory). The joy was, however, short lived. The charger failed to work. Went for return option but customer executive suggested a test via Blancco App. Done. Thereafter, he assigned a technician to visit my place and inspect the phone. Alas, the technician didn't turn up nor did he respond to call. In the meantime, phone frequently began to hang and misbehave. As of now I am cursing my fate. It is worst ever phone i have come across. Don't waste your money. You will repent the decision to buy this phone. Please take my advice seriously. This Redmi 8A dual phone will turn your face red with anger...

  I have  purchased this mobile on 25 July and within seven days mobile Battery is draining very fast. I want to return this faulty mobile. But return window is closed .Amazon can help in this

"
"

  I've been using Xiaomis product from Its Note 4 launch and was satisfied by its performance as well as its manufacturing in India as all the box contains information that it is MADE IN INDIA but this was the 1st time i bought this phone and it doesnt have that MADE IN INDIA logo and it's clearly written over there on the phone that it's MADE IN CHINA😠 I've not expected this from #Redmi_India that they cannot afford a budget segment phones manufacturing in their own country 🤧🤕

"
"

  It has a problem. Of getting auto boot since day one.....recently it flashed with Android 10.....and since then it shuts down auto and it takes very firm press on the power button to boot.....and when u are doing this after every 2 hrs then quite a fun.....I will never buy MI product in my life......it was first n last time I did.....these cheap Chinese re-incarnation claiming to be made in India. .....I really don't believe with the quality it's packed with.....

"
"

  At the budget I didn't have any other choice. So bought this phone, totally a killer.Cons - signal reception not good and no fingerprint scanner.Pros - display and battery is awesome.I had issues with battery backup atfirst later on I turned off may things, which was automatically running in background. Now the battery is unbelievably good, mom is totally Happy with it.

"
"

  At this price range this is a good buy. The phone looks elegant and sleek.The camera is good outdoors in sunlight but in dark spaces it does not perform well. Again at this price it is worth it.The Ad ridden OS is a bit irritating but once the warranty is void one can install custom ROM.It is easy to handle and carry and the does not feel heavy even with the 5k battery.Did not face any overheating issues so far.I never play games so have nothing to comment on that front.Screen clarity is good and brightness in sunlight is also not an issue (I use dark mode)Overall a good buy but in a month or so you may get better models.

"
"

  I've used many phones in this budget segment from renowned brands. I was always skeptical about Redmi/Xiaomi. It was hard to make a decision of buying this phone. But to be honest, I'm totally moved! Be it the display, be it looks, usage, it is totally a power package. The amazing thing is, you're getting 5000 MAH battery in less than 8k ! Easily runs over 1.5 days with a full charge and average usage (multitasking, video streaming, browsing, social media). It also comes with 18W Fast Charging support. The display will blow your mind. Looks are quite good, could've been better. What is a drawback is it doesn't have a Fingerprint Sensor, which is a must for phones in this budget! Camera quality is ""just okay"".Lastly, I'm using this device for the last 4-5 days, didn't feel any lag though it comes with 2GB RAM, all credits to Redmi's amazing optimisation.You can go for it without a single doubt in your mind if your budget is right.

"
"

  Very bad experience, just after 20 days, it is not working properly. Many times while using this ohone, it automatically closes all the apps and returns to home screen and then it just hangs and then we have to restart it to make it work again.

"
"

  I am using 2gb/32gb variant(white). Using it since 16 days and have not found a problem yet... No hanging/lagging...i have downloaded games of 250-300 mb and played it... The result was fantastic and neither it hanged nor became hot while playing or charging... Speaker sound is pretty good and Camera quality is superb in good lighting conditions mainly during day time (outdoors), no one can say it's a 8k below phone by looking it's camera performance due to SD processor and battery backup is good too....Conclusion:- This phone is for people who are not game addict and those who love photography but are know in budget... The phone performance is lag free for day to day usage and most importantly uninstall or disable the preloaded apps if you don't use it.

"
"

  The modem of this phone is very slow. It gives only half the actual speed. My other phone gives a speed of 90mbps on wifi whereas this phone give only 40 mbps on same network. Getting less than 1 mbps on LTE networks. Camera is below average.

"
"

  Don't go for this phone unless your budget is very low.This phone doesn't have aby fingerprint scanner. Fast charger doesn't come in the box.Neither comes a back case or screen protector or headphone. You have to buy all those separately.Camera quality is also not good.My suggestion is to spend 1-2k extra and go for other good phones.

"
"

  I would like to start with prosPros:1. After unboxing, the first feel and look is awesome. The aura x grip design on the back of the device is superb considering its price range which gives a premium feel while you are holding the device in your hands.2. The big 6.22 inch ips lcd display of resolution 720x1520. The viewing angles are good and comes with support of sunlight display which mean in outdoors one will not have a problem viewing this device. Due to its large screen content consuming is very good and the dot notch in the top middle of the screen does not annoy while watching videos or playing games. The display also comes with gorilla glass 5 protection which is very rare in this price segment and protects your device to some extent from scratches and drops.3. This device comes with p2i nano coating which means it can save the device from splashes of water to a certain extent. But do not dip it in water as it is not water resistant.4. This device comes with snapdragon 439 processor which is based on 12nm process. This chipset can go up to 2ghz and performs day to day task and gaming easily. Pubg lite and pubg mobile runs smoothly on this device. Pubg lite can go up to a maximum resolution of balanced at very high frame rates whereas pung mobile can go upto balanced with medium frame rates. Both games run smoothly without any lag or stutter.5. This device is powered by a 5000mah battery which gives a backup of upto 2 dys on average usage. But for heavy gamers and content viewers this device gives backup of upto a day on single charge. This device comes with 10ww charge and if you charge with 10w charger it takes around 2hr 30min but if you charge it by 18w charger it takes around 2hr.6. The camera on the back is 13+2 mp AI dual camera. The ai scene detection is good and fast. The backgroung blur during portrait mode is very good and the selfie camera is 8mp ai camera. This also support portrait mode but the blur could have been better. Both camera support 1080p recording at 30fps.7. Comes with face unlock and is pretty fast with proper lighting condition.Cons:1. The cameras could have been better.2. IR blaster is missing.3. Notification Led is missing.4. Fingerprint reader is missing.5. Both cameras struggles in low light conditions.6. Comes with miui with full of bloatwares and ads. But they can be disabled and and stopped.WARNING: For non chinese smartphone users if you buy this phone it will com with pre installed chinese apps banned by Indian government bu they will fix it with an ota update so not worry.My Opinion:After using this device I would recommend this device to buyers with budget under 10,000. Everything is good and the updates are also quick and timely. And no problem with the device.

  After 1 week of usage:Nice battery backup (5000 mah)Nice display qualityGood soundNice camera quality in this budget.Big displayFace lock available however no fingerprint scanner.As said on the box it support wireless FM but it doesn't support wireless FM you need to connect your headphone for FM frequency.Support Fast charging which is very useful thing.Overall nice phone to buy.Thanks to Amazon for the exchange offer.

  Got my new redmi phone. Overall the phone is as per the features, but the quality of camera is not as per the advertisment, selfie camera is better than back camera, you can understand how the back camera is,  previously had Samsung phone with same mega pixel camera, it clicked so well, so here is the sincere request to all buyers, if looking for good camera, don't go for it,

"
"

  this is a good smartphone which comes with the USB Type C, 5000mah Battery, Good Vivid Screen, Gorilla Glass 5 Protection ,Good Camera Dual rear Camera (13mp+2mp), 8mnp selfie camera which u don't find under other smartphones of  this Budget segment  to be noted do not compare with other high budget smartphones camera ABOVE 10Kand in the last latest android 10 update Released in india & latest MIUI 12 is on its way in next month2GB variant performs well  Ram remains all the time under 60% usageThis is Good Buck Performs and Give features u cannot find in other smartphones , and other smartphones which are available i'm sure they are under preform as per the new smartphones of Redmi 9A, Redmi 9 they even also not has these features and comes with the DOWNGRADED REBRANDED PROCESSOR

  From a budget mobile battery backup and call quality are expected, call quality is pathetic, mic not clear, other party most of the times say that my audio is not clear. Further, earpiece volume is not loud and clear, I am not a power user, just some calls where it frustrated me and some youtube that's it, battery backup is good but what is the use of advancement in technology when it is not performing it's basic task, MI if listening provide good mic, speakers and earpiece for an overall good experience,

"
"

  I expected a little more performance from a redmi phone. It has the typical problems of a 2 GB RAM phone. Really slow. I bought it for my mother. For her use it is just ok. For better performance, a minimum 4 GB RAM phone is needed, no matter which brand you select.

"
"

  I bought this phone for my Father and generally preferred type c charging port which is provided by this 8000 rupee phone , although it has old processor but i must say optimization is good and also look of this is just awesome (not feel like cheap phone).Only draw back is miui which tons of ad but i find a solution to remove unnecessary apps which send anonymous notification.

"
"

  It have sturdy Build Quality . corned with gorilla glass 5 and The display quality is Good.Pros :-Nice Build Quality 10/10Good Camera (both front and back)8/10Smooth performance 9/10Face unlock is pretty fast ( never expected that ) 10/10Good for Mid end gaming 8/10Battery is an absolute monster 10/10Nice display 8/10USB C + fast chasrging 10/10Cons  :-No Finger print censorMy Rating is 8.5/10

"
"

  I don't like this.This is not a good product, I'm huge fan of redmi mobiles,i had also used the phone of this company and that was awesome but this is not good.I will just give only one 🌟 because the phone is not working properly and it is hanging

"
"

  When it comes to budget mobile phones with latest features u cant go wrong with Xiaomi phones. This model is  one such example. You get Good battery, Gorilla screen, big screen size (very big so some 1) etc. Overall value for money!

"
"

  I use this phone more than 5 months I buy it on 4 march 2020 this phone is very very nice 😊👍 in my favor because I buy this phone for my father and it is very easy to use for him and but i brought this phone at range of 6999 rupee and also I see that phone is not lagging and not get heated 🔥  and camera of phone is also niceBut 1 mistake is that his AI screen lock 🔐 not ❌ get open in Instantely but overall this phone cames with 24 hour battery life if you check this phone in volt 📞 and sync and volt to use without power savingBut i see this phone price is geeted increase from 6999++ that shocking for this phone love for people and for peoplepeople and i also play PUBG in a starting months to check the phone performance which is ossom his all sensor almost Avery was working but i don't play now because it my father's mobile 🤣🤣🤣🤣💯💯

"
"

  Best mobile in this budget, Great battery backup...Just once when mobile received, Pls Go in to settings - Accessibility - OFF will be done.Not any problem shown till now, I purchased this mobile 3 Qty for me - my sister - mh wife. (By different ID's)Not a single problem shoen till now.

"
"

   Hii Everyone...I received this phone in a brand new condition.Everything was fine but there is a technical issue in the software or might be in display....When i used this phone on the very first day i did not notice this error.But next day i saw this fault.The display of the phone was getting hang sometimes...Pixels was bursting also...And there were some glitches on the display when i was using it.So i returned this phone. You may also see the pictures and video which i attached here.It might be a technical error.Otherwise Packaging was good.I received this product too early.It was not a seller's fault.Amazon also refunded the total amount.Thank you Amazon.

"
"

  There is no finger print point,. Camera quality is very cheap & poor even 5000/- phone has better camera. If single camera is better, no need of such dual camera. XIAOMI just making fool. Screen is so so. Battery is good. Overall just 5 yrs back quality.

"
"

  All good, as per the cost, eveey this is appropriate but it could have the fingerprint scanner. Processor and ram is okay for this price... No over heating issue. Good and smooth running. Can play Cod or pubg in medium settings. Battery is okay.. 5 watt charger in the box,, but it supports 18 watt fast chaeger, at this price, in box 5 watt charger is okay but if it could come, it shall be a best option because battery is big 5000 mah. No back cover. All redmk phns come with a back cover. But this is exceptional in this phone. All over 7 out of 10. Performance is excellent but accessories could have been upgraded in the box.

"
"

  Firstly 5 stars to Amazon for delivery this mobile phone with in 24 hours.Coming to this mobile phone, my first impressions are it is working good and I liked it's display.  Especially this low budget phone has Vowifi ( Wifi calling ) feature.  Camera is not good ( don't except much for this low price).  Still review under progress.

"
"

  Nice phone in this price range except bit big to handle . I personally recommend not go for this screen size, as it is very difficult to handle or pick call using one hand (mostly during driving or doing some other work). it is quite slippery, so you land up with cover which makes it too big to keep it in pocket.

"
"

  This review is for REDMI 8A DUAL 3GB RAM 32GB ROM(for use 21gb)Nice budget product. Large battery life last 1-2days. Camera is of average quality. Dual 4g standby. Charger given is of 10 watt. Type c port otg support. No fingerprint . Has face unlock. No ir blaster. Good sound and its quality. Sim tray is risky to use very delicate. Very less heating if you use it continuous

"
"

  Not really value for money, a lot of bloatware comes pre-installed even in October 2020, many ads, faltu apps like hago, Zilli, etc. Are automatically installed within 24 to 48 hours of usage. xiaomi is cheating on everyone by showing they didn't give installed app but they automatically install it from their storage later. For specs you should go for other company phone this is overpriced by ₹500.Camera Quality is not even of 5MP. And front camera just exist for name. Once you see the quality you would not use it again

"
"

  Good phone and value for money, good at memory 3GB.. good response time, speed compared to other android phone with 3GB, may be its new 😊, if you have MI TV, screen mirroring is excellent on the full HD VIEW AND SOUND QUALITY. There’s no delay in streaming at allI bought it for online classes for my kid to use “teams” and “zoom” app streaming on big screen for better view and sound qualityAnd since a month the quality of speed and battery backup is good

"
"

  Thanks Amazon for being care full about your costumer products quality and delivery........ So i am writing an 30day long review.......... Redmi 8a dual is an such an nise phone...... I order it on colour white and ran 2gb rom32gb..... But i could not found any problem with this smartphone .......... I charge this phone for an 2houres just and it's chargeing is 👌👌👌👌very fast .,......... I am an free fire lover and I can easily play free, on this device........ I couldn't see any problem on this device camera quality is also good..,. I suggest all costumer go for....

"
"

  After using 10 days I'm writing this review, camera quality is very poor, display average, phone speed is okay, battery backup is very good, but charging time takes 3 hours, for old age people this phone is good not for youngsters

"
"

  Pretty Much Bang for The Buck if you are on a budget . You know the specs go for it . Don't expect higher performance on this budget . According to the budget Mi is delivering the best value .Now if you have some sentimental ego about Made In India products then my friend go and buy a Banana and pretend you are using a smartphone .Thank You.

"
"

  Budget phone for people who are looking to buy their 1st smart phone in life. I bought it for my mother and she is happy with it. Serves the purpose of a first time smart phone user very well. Ordered grey colour.. looks nice tooFace recognition works only in best light. Not counting it as a negative since it is not a must feature. Camera quality is good ( expect what you will get at this price)

"
"

  So far not happy with this phone , although I am not using it personally now but used it for 2 months . It’s not worth buying . Inferior quality features dines not work well . Application support as well as google store content restriction observed while installing vc apps . Don’t recommend !

"
"

  It was a good phone though it hs 2 BG ram but it looks was pretty good n battery was aswme whch was 5000 not even we get in othr top models and evn the fingerprint sensor r good but if u r buying thn buy wid 3gb or with 4gb wil more bettr

"
"

  Iam giving this review more than one month usage yesterday the phone have been dropped in to more than 6 feet depth water tank with in some minutes we took the phone nothing happened to the phone its working normally just we cleaned the phone that to after taking my phone from the water it didn't even turn off and perfomance wise its simplicity good for this budget this phone is more than enough

"
"

  On This Price Range Redmi 8A Dual, is best.I brought Sea blue colour smart phone grippy disign 👌. Redmi 8A Dual is best for biginners.Best camera smart phone under 8k.Main camera 13mp 👌,  secondery camera 2mp depth sensor.👍Front camera : average , It's not clicks quality pictures.👎Battery 5000 mAh : normal use 2 - 3 days battery backup.👌Display : average Lcd display.👍But display disign is superb water drop notch display.face unlock is normal but medium fast but good.Best stylish smartphone under this price thanks to Xiaomi.

"
"

  Good battery, just decent processor, can play pubg mobile only with lowest graphics only, if you want a satisfyingly smooth gaming experience, but for all other uses rather than huge games, it's best buy for this money except for moto g8 lite.

"
"

  If u want to buy a phone with ₹7000 budget this is the best phone....Awesome battery life .....speakers are good ....coming to camera I give 3.5/5...not too bad or not too good ...but money worthy

"
"

   1) Product is good but unforunately I have received this product where its Power key button not working, when i have pressed power button it shows FastBoot image logo , then again i pressed power button then it has been started.2) Also its Volume down key not working only upper key working.3) I have Taken Volume Key Button Vedio for your reference.4) If Possible contact with us because I need replacement not a refund, But when sending new device kindly check on your end all features and all physical accesseries (Like Button, Battery,Charger are in good condition i.e working properly)

"
"

  Really very nice and looks for this mobile but unfortunately thee mobile is not charging up. After contacting the customer care and they did test using the blancoo diagnostic app and confirmed the same. I have asked the replacement for this mobile but they are stated as this is service not possible & refunded the amount.Now I'm looking foe the new mobiles like redmi 9 but not able to place the order while flash sale time.

"
"

  Great value for moneyGreat battery lifeDoesn't hang in day to day tasksType c port with support for 18 watt chargingScreen is good for its priceCamera takes good pictures in day light but in artificial light and low light the quality is trash

"
"

  Very bad product, delivered on 12th July 2020 and I'm writing this review on 1st August 2020, the phone hanged, no app is opening, after restarting also same problem, I brought it for online studies now have to give it in service centre , very bad experience with this phone, recommend not to buy it for anyone.

"
"

  Please dond buy this...one of the worst mobile.keeps disconnected to the network and internet speed was very bad..same sim is working well in other mobile..When I purchased it was 7k,,that itself i felt wated money..Now they increased to 8200,,I dont know what makes it worth..Please dont buy this...

"
"

  Phone hangs and it behaves what ever way it want example it open wats app nd  clicks on Send nd send nd send... Without human intervention I am wondering did I bought mobile or Robot which is frustrated

"
"

  Thanx to Amazon for its fast delivery, in just 2 days..I love shopping on Amazon.One of the best phones under 9K.Redmi has proved its worth..a very good one for daily usage of social media apps like YouTube, Facebook, instagram, etc.. camera & audio quality is also very good..Also games can be played, design & midnight Black colour is simply awesome..Very good as of now I'll update after 1 month.

"
"

  If you are facing problems with the phone accessories, they do not consider it as a problem. If you want to return, they won't allow to do that. They just give chance for replacement and the replaced product may come even worse than before.The Adapter gets heated like a hair-straighter within 10 mins. I asked for a technician and they provided one after 3 weeks. I had to order replacement and the replaced product came even worse. The phone itself started heating along with the defective adapter.

"
"

  It is very initial review based on 3 days usage.First review for Amazon: Excellent experience with Amazon till date. Wonderful buying and up-to-date delivery by Amazon. Thanks.Now mobile: I purchased this redme phone for my wife by looking her usage. Handset is perfect for her and working as per the expectations. Detailed review will write after 3 months.

"
"

  1) Product- Product is good, value for money and handy.2) Delivery- Best delivery experience. Many times on time delivery followed.3) Service- Better service provided by Amazon and product seller. Nice...Keep It Up...Thanks to Amazon...

"
"

   Power button not working properly hence returned. Screen guard ordered separately there is return option. Amazon team i hope will help in this case.

"
"

  Nice phone good in 6.499 is realy nice but not so fast working when open lock it will take 4 to 5 I have to swipe than is open why this happen I don't know  n other things is battery drain fast just in 5000 mh so with use 12hr net than almost 1 day only

"
"

  Product is some what ok. Because my sister needed in this price. Seller APPARIO package is very worst. I give 1 star to seller. Just packed with cover.  No care. Worst packaging.

"
"

  Superb phone at this budget and excellent value for money plus all the features built in with the latest version of technology and software, the only thing is that it is without finger print sensor, but at this budget it is acceptable. 👍👌

"
"

  Pathetic mobile phone in cheaper price. They are not only accepting return the phone but also denying to replace it. Still I'm keep on talking to their technician and they are doing their practicals on that mobile phone by requesting to install other app, switching on and off, updating software. I'm so exhausted now with the Amazon service. I had so much trust on Amazon now their representatives and technicians are forcing me not to believe in Amazon anymore.

"
"

  My Experience is...Do not buy 2 GB Variant mobile as now days most of latest mobile run on Andorid 10 which need minimum 3 GB to run all application smoothly. while i am using app its lack many time.. Sometimes its crashes.. its a worst experience when you are using New Mobile and it doesn't meet minimum Expectation..Don't Expect Good Selfie camera,  Overall mobile is Good.Its support Fast charging is quiet nice feature given in this Price price range.Pls buy Min. 3 GB Ram Variant

"
"

  As per add, it was 10v charger along with the box, but in box it was 5V charger...Due to this wrong charger it is taking over 3 hours to charge 100%.... Also this charge is getting drain before Eod..Absolutely unhappy..So I would suggest, pls pay extra and go for a better mobile than this low end models....

"
"

  I purchased mobile Redmi 8A Dual from Amazon, After one month mobile is auto shut many times.Whenever call is received phone goes auto switch & auto shut.Battery is also not good, discharge within 12 hours.

"
"

  Screen is LCD, not vibrant at all. Contains lot of bloat ware. One thing I liked are the alert tones. Better buy Samsung galaxy m series. This phone is good for gifting... Gifting parents or dumb girlfriends

"
"

  it's a very good product in the market at a reasonable and affordable price.  i had purchased it for my kids for online classes and it is serving the purpose very well.it's 5000 mah battery is good. overall its a best buy.

"
"

  It seems i received a defective piece and now after the purchase of 10 days the mobile works automatically ... When I call amazon they are saying return policy is over and they cannot do anything... It really lack of services and amazon should take action on this because they are the one delivering the product.. Really disappointed and helpless ...

"
"

  I previously gifted it to one of my girlfriends. Now I bought again for another girlfriend because all are equal to me. The phone is good because it has a good battery backup time and good performance. But only disappointed me because it doesn't have a fingerprint sensor. I compared the phone with my Galaxy S10 lite and found a huge difference. From the display to the performance, all feacher in the S10 lite is awesome.

"
"

  Overall, the product is as described except the charger, only a 10W charger is included in the box.I think the handset is bit heavy though I have not checked the weight of handsets of other brands in this price range.I will write a detailed review after using it for some time.

"
"

  Seems like software problems with deviceVery bad experience i had with mi really disappointed. Customer care not responding don't know what should i do now.. Request to amazon please find some way..

"
"

  Best in this segment in terms of battery life and other features. don't have IR blaster, camera is average. keep min 1GB RAM space empty to run high end games Turbo game booster option do the job.Need to see in the long run.

"
"

  Phone is okay, basic phone with 2gb, smooth UI, but I remember xiaomi came up with 5a it was smaller and weigh lesser than this. I purchased this phone for my dad, its too heavy and slips a lot other than that it's okay.

"
"

  The phone was bought for the daughter of an employee to attend online classes. She is extremely happy and able to attend online classes.hence the purpose & objective for purchase has been fulfilled.

"
"

  Product is all-over good but it will be helpful if seller provide the tax invoice or purchase bill in some hard printing material. It will be useful in future to us.

"
"

  This product is very good.But after 20 days the phone was 1st time hang.Now it takes almost 3 hour to be fully charged.Sometime the touch screen is not responding,after restart it works normally.Due to lockdown and current situation I can't go to the nearest service centre.So I am very upset.Please advice me what I should do.

"
"

  There's no fingerprint reader, it would be good if they'd have mentioned it, but i gotta say that I'm amazed by the face recognition reader, it's a lightweight gigantic phone with powerful processor.For the budget, it's a worth buying. Just go for it!!!PS - I just received it so wait for the further update.

"
"

  Bigger battery, nice processor, good camera. Budget phone in this price segment. It's quite ok for the daily staff. The build quality and the back panel is the main highlights. But quite disappointed that no back cover is in with phone.

"
"

  Just a couple of days latter, the phone started behaving abnormally. Application would open on their own randomly. Seemed liked some spot on the touch screen remain pressed and it kept opening up apps. Had to reboot it everytime to sort this out.The phone otherwise works smooth. But this above problem has occurred a multiple of time which has soured my experience.

"
"

  I have not tested the Mobile couz its a gift.But hats off to Xiaomi for bringing phones in this price point with so much specifications.Its a high time for Non-Chinese brands do something or loose the market to China !!

"
"

  Phone quality is good and battery life is also good ..in this range 7499 ... 5000 mah battery and dual camera all are best...Bt only a thing there is no finger print...... Only face lock.. bt it's okkk...It's best phone......

"
"

  This is my 3rd Redmi Phone. I had Redmi 2, Redmi 4, and this is my Redmi 8A Dual. The only drawback what Noticed is Finger Print Missing. I have  lots of apps which require authentication. In my Redmi 4 I had finger print So I unlocked easily all my apps without entering the password / PIN. But in Redmi 8A Dual, I have to manually enter all those keys. Its really pathetic sometime. But other than that I didn't found any other brand who is offering  3GB 64GB for Rs 8999.

"
"

  Superb Phone. Value for Money. MI is always a trusted brand in India. Excellent battery life, faster processorfor general use,  good call quality,  Camera is also good. Go for it guys. At this price level, no other phone can beat this phone

"
"

  Awesome battery backup...Best camera in this price ..Processor is working good not best above average..Overall best in price...

"
"

  It is a good phone and value for money. But itsCamera is not very good.It has high perfomance and great battery capacity.But it has no fingerprint lock system. The phone is very smooth and it has several other quality. The phone can duplicate one app to double.all over it is a good and value for money.I like the product because it is smooth,high battery perfomance and high phone performance

"
"

  Worst product. But more disappointing is Amazon service. The phone started malfunctioning after a few days. First it started hanging and then began off and on all on a sudden.  The problem started just before an hour of scheduled replacement. Initially I thought it is a temporary problem. But when I discovered that the problem is permanent I tried for replacement. But the return window had closed just 5 minutes earlier. Because of 5 minutes delay Amazon didn't care for my repeated request.

"
"

  Very poor product within 4 months the mobile hanged and when took to service centre and they flashed the memory and restarted it after 2 more restarts one more given to service centre and one at home now again hanged Service centre is now recommends change of mother board. When there is a repetitive issue within warranty should not the equipment be replaced however now after warranty the problem is mine

"
"

  When package arrived , got feared like this could be dummy item (junk) by the way it was packed , inside box edge was scrapped , In order to be safety measure , started recording for opening the box , phone was fine for price paid , packaging skills need to be improved by the retailer , when it travels long distance ,packaging matters all on the product.

"
"

  I am facing the screen flickering while using ICICI Mobile banking. is there anyone who is facing the same problem.and any guideline to solve this .so many unuseful apps are available.unable to disable like stock Android...better to go with stock android phone

"
"

  The phone doesn't have a fingerprint scanner but then again with this price range, I did not expect it to have one. Battery life is really good. Even with the dual camera, the quality of pictures suuck really bad. Using Instagram for pictures will help on this device. The 2 GB ram is not at all sufficient for a smartphone these days. If you're shifting from one app to another, the phone lags. Even when you back to home screen after heavy usage of any app, it lags.

"
"

  Nice product with good battery life.For normal use,browsing, you tube, and other uses it is good choice.Redmi mobile are value for money. In affordable prices you get much more.

"
"

  Display quality, camera quality are very poor. App icons on the screen appear hazy. I wasted my money.

"
"

  this phone is very very e nice and mid range is super best value for money phone redmi 8a dualthis phone in battery super charger super display sound quality superb but camera very very badspecial thank you For MI India and Amazon all team very very very thank youthis phone mid range very nice price and me e recommended this phone purchase you all of you

"
"

  This is a basic notch smart phone.... Good for middleaged useres or normal basic user...Front camera is good but rear camera is not that much good... but good for this price... Battery life is so good... but no fast charging... And finger print scanner( may be u will not get  finger print  with any phone in this price range )...  Bought it for my uncle... Look wise its soooo beautiful... Processor nad working is average

"
"

  Recently purchased a week back... Very poor battery backup... The company is claiming 5000mah... It will it is not even 2000mah....it doesnt even last for more then 6hrs...withour even usage... Very poor product... Please dont purchase mi products... Worst

"
"

  Its so worse that when product performance is not good there is NO OPTION TO RETURN. I couldn't even place return order on the day it got delivered. The reason given is so stupid: ""It contains battery, so can't be returned"". Come on, expected something better atleast. Worst ever experience to me after using Amazon for 5 years.Please think twice before ordering anything valuable on Amazon. This would be my last order

"
"

  This is defective products touch automatically worked  Amazon seller cheating a customer defective products send not purchase amazon and seller apprilo seller  you purchase other site I used this products 10 day but today hang automatically  I going to xiaomi service center but not accept it is defective  I blame you fell down this mobile but not fell down this is the modus operandi cheating a customer and Amazon 10 returns period end  seller repair products send me

"
"

  The build quality seems to be good. But the performance is nowhere near what it should deliver! Hasn't even been a week and it already is showing signs of slowing down...

"
"

  MI Remote not working. I purchased Redmi MI 8A mobile phone 8 Sep then replace it again i purchased same then it arrived on 20 Sep that same mobile's MI remote not working and some other was i facing then I raised the complaint. That also replace after it mobile arrived on 4th Oct. In this mobile phone also not working MI Remote.I would like to suggest you, if you are going to use all features of MI Redmi 8A then don't go for it.

"
"

  The phone is absolutely great. I got the phone in 6550₹ in Amazon independence sale. The camera quality both rear and front is great, 5000mah battery is a great advantage with fast charging. Although the processor is old but seems to be working smooth. The phone back panel matte texture feels absolutely great.

"
"

  After 2 month phone outgoing voice not working,And customer service is Redmi not proper responce, they provide only 10 day service not 1 year serviceI recommend don't buy this phone because of customer service

"
"

  Good phone for the price paid...budget friendly for online classes for students...But be aware...I bought it thinking that XIAOMI is making phone in india...but it's actually importing it from china...and further more only replacement option is available... no return policy..

"
"

  Good phone at this price with a large display and a 13mp+2mp rear camera and a 8mp front camera a 5000mAh battery. Big drawback is the absence of finger scanner. But a good product over all.

"
"

  The phone started acting up as soon as it was turned on--the camera doesn't work (as soon as camera is turned on the screen goes dark!), the phone wouldn't ring for WhatsApp calls, the WhatsApp video call function doesn't work as the camera would make the screen go dark. Do not buy from Appario Retail Pvt Ltd--I don't know why AMAZON allows these kinds of dishonest retailers who sell defective products on their site! Very bad experience.

"
"

  Great phone in this price range with sd439, battery life is good , it comes with C type charging facility it is a good pointPurchase only for basic use not for gaming.

"
"

  It will be in the form of brick in your hand, UI sucks to the core, still there are betterr options, face lock is a joke. the processor is way old could not handle multiple task. Does not able to support dual band in WIFI. Think before you guys buy it

"
"

  Battery is good but processor is slow work.Sounds quality is average.Wi-Fi connection is very bad. OTP generation is very bad ofter one minute late arriving OTP SMS.Finger print sensors not provide.First time users can take this phonePhone design is best👍 in blue colour.Overall good phone in this Price range if service center service is good.But I am not satisfied this phone.

"
"

  this mobile we have 3 pieces ay home, using since 8 months, and it works like a charm in all media, gaming also work without any problem. best phone in the market, USB-C is a bonus.

"
"

  Everythin is good...!!I got it @7649rs during primday sale...!!But processer is low i.e 439SDCamera is as per value of money...!!Battery is good...!!

"
"

  It is a good phone. Nice and superb in model, and long life 5000 mah battery, absolutely good for gaming. It provide full screen option and swith option is nice thing. Camera is not out standing but very good. Dual Sim, dual camera and smart face lock. Good in quality, power full glasses and smooth. Advanced features available  here. Not only is good phone but also it's helpful. Low cost but quality is very good.

  This device has great battery life.But it's volume buttons are not working properly, after a week.Full of ads.But other features are good.It has no any fingerprint sensor. As well as ""face unlock"" is very slow.Don't buy, if you are a gamer or college studend.I recommend you redmi Note 7s or 7pro, redmi Note 8 or 8 pro.This smartphone has very low RAM.which is not sufficient for a student ...(Multitasking)

  I bought this mobile for my Grandmother. As per her usage, it's quite good but when it comes to usage by me. It wouldn't meet the need. Camera quality is pretty average but it is decent as per the pricing. Battery life is good. It easily gives around two days for normal usage. It's handy and perfect for normal users overall it's a good mobile for normal users.

"
"

  Nice phone in such an economical range. Battery life and camera quality is good. Fingerprint reader is also quick and easily readable. Screen size and phone storage is also ok. What else could one get in such a price range.Nice phone for those who want in the range of below 8k.

"
"

  The phone is good for usual browsing or low end games. You can play high end games like PUBG on low settings still with a small lag. One of cons is it doesn't have a fingerprint reader but has a 2D face unlock which works fine. Camera quality is okaish, what you expect from an under 10k smartphone. Best part is its 5000 mah battery, also supports 18 W fast charging but comes with 10 W charger. Overall a good budget phone.

"
"

  Device is very good in this price. Touch is not that fast. Meets needs of basis Android well. Earphone and back cover should have been included. Sound quality is loud enough. Overall grade phone.

"
"

  Can blindly buy this mi product for the UI, looks, resolution, battery life and the economic price. We received 10% discount during the independence day sale. Cant be happier! Go for it!

"
"

  Lovely product at lowest price

"
"

  Waste of time money and energy. This Phone did not even last for 10 days

"
"

  Superb amazing phoneUnless sd 439 no heating issues not foundBattery backup is amazingBut it have 10w charger on box super phone but only it has 2 gb ram it is not enough for gamers  and also it a good phone for average user camera quality is super and face unlock is faster best battery  backup for normal users sometimes  it hang

"
"

  Redmi 8A dual is a better one but this time price is higher than normal. I purchase it Rs-8200/- which should be around 6500- 6999. Due to necessity i purchased it.

"
"

  Budget Smartphone, very good performnce, I booked for my relative. He is using it, no complaint from him. But camera littile bit dull.  Other wise great smartphone in this price. Go for it.

"
"

  I have been using Mi phones for couple of years and happy with my experience. So I blinday went for Redmile 8A dual which is really affordable with big screen long battery life and sleek design. Thanks amazon

"
"

  Phone us superb at this Price range. No phone is Better below 8k.Though it is a chinese phone but se Dont have any swadeshi phone in india. So Better to buy this phone if you have less money.Bought it @6500₹ at sale..Battery is super Awsome.. Camera is so so in this Price Its Very good.Dont think much just go fir it. You will Definatly love this Beautiful phone specialy blue one.

"
"

  The Redmi 8A phone's camera quality is stunning with long battery life. FM and sound quality are fabulous. Looks and ocean blue colour is better.The main thing easily changes with other Indian languages. No lagging for games.

"
"

  I brought this phone for my mother. The interface, sensor, camera quality is great and other features are also nice.  Easy to use.If you want a budget phone then you must go for this one.

"
"

  I am reviewing it after 2 months of usage...i will definitely say the battery life is amazing ..But the phone is lagging too much...even you cant play normal games like clash of clans, garden escapes ..also you can see so much lag while doing multitask...like whatsapp fb youtube..Camery is avg ..you cant expect great camera in this rangeBut i will suggest realme c3 ..c3 is way better than redmi 8a dual device..

"
"

  No fingerprint,. No infrared..OK but.. Given hardware is also bad.Camera worste.Sound quality is bad.2gb ram its my failure choice.Its just a phone with basic features.I don't why. Corporates finally blam customers. They want to enjoy the blood of customers to make money.Waste of money.Degraded features.

"
"

  While the phone is very good at this price, from processor and features perspective, annoyingly the charger came alongwith is pathetically slow....I had put my phone on charge for half an hour and the charge moved up just by 3%. Need a replacement of charger pls.

"
"

  Speakers are not powerful enough and call quality is poor .. returned product and got refund thanks to amazon

"
"

  No back cover, no screen guard, no fingerprint sensor, and no earphone in box, very bad camera, weak plastic backside. The screen broke after falling from 1 meter distance. I'm very unsatisfied by this phone. Also this is cheap china mobile. Avoid buying this phone. Don't waste money on this phone. Put some more money and get samsung, lg or apple mobile. You will regret after buying this phone.

"
"

  Battery is good enough. But camera is third class..camera is not as i expected in a 7500Rs. Phone. If you make call in speaker mode then the other side would not be able to hear you properly. One more..if you use few more apps then it's use to getting hang. Very disappointing..😣😣

"
"

  I was not fully confident to purchase phone on online. That too 8000 up to.. With Amazon I had a hope.. They are best and trustworthy.. Hence its proved.. .. I'm so happy..  I got sea blue. . I love the color. . Camera quality is sooo good.. Battery life is amazing.. I chargd 96 per onday before yesterday .. Yesterday full day I used my mobiles.. Today still have 38 percentage. . .im sooo satisfied with this product.. Thanku amazon

"
"

  There is no fingerprint reader but the battery life is amazing of thumping 5000mah and the camera quality is also nice with zooming capability up to 8x. Overall the phone is nice. It has a nice design and is large enough and I think it has infinity display and I think it is better than the price though I am reviewing it on the day I got it I will edit this review after 2-3 months of usage.

"
"

  Happy with the product.Look wise,function wise and battery wise this product is good and if you are looking for a decent phone for regular use then can easily go for it.It provides many features at much lower range than many others which are charging you higher for same stuff

"
"

  The phone is very good for single hand use.The screen size is perfect for watching videos.Design of the phone is also good.We r getting type C charger out of the box and it also supports fast charging.The camera quality is decent for the price range.

"
"

  Using it for last one week and performance is very bad. Can't even use the WhatsApp. Hanging regularly.

"
"

  Pros:Good Battery lifeCompact and easy to handleExcellent Design in its segmentCons:Little bit slowVerdict:If you are a basic user go for it.....If you are a gamer it will disappoint you...

"
"

  Worst product this is, hanging problem since purchase, I never thought MI phone has such quality. I never suggest anyone to buy this one. Processor is too slow.

"
"

  I would say the camera qaulity is better but not the best at this price Point. Battery is Excellent but sometimes it feels like that the battery is 4000mah and one Major problem is there is fingerprint however the face unlock is awesome all over things are Great but the price should be at 8000 not 8999 . I AM using it from 2months and there is no hang problem but android 10 update battery is running fastly

"
"

  No finger print reader.Very good battery life.Average camera( better with Google cam app than the inbuilt one).Truly worth money product in 7k range smart phones of all brands.I bought 3gb 32gb for 6999 don't know why they are now selling the same 8.3k .Any way good phone and not for high end gaming.

"
"

  The returned product has the same problem as before. Not a got phone to buy. This phone has a very slow and bad processor, it hangs or crashes ALL THE TIME. The plastic used for theconstruction of the back is very cheap. You cannot use this phone with patience or Calmness. It is a very bad phone. I do not recommend you buying this phone

"
"

   I ordered and got delivery.For first two days it worked fine. On third battery was at 10% and I opened the WhatsApp, then suddenly colored strips started appearing on screen. Not just WhatsApp, but for google also. See attached video for details.I asked  amazon for replacement but they are asking me to send it by courier in this lock down times.Pathetic product..

"
"

  During this pandemic, I had lost hope that I will get a premium smartphone under 9000 rupees but Amazon made it possible.  No doubt performance of this mobile phone is quite good. Battery life is awesome. Camera quality is not very good but if you look the price of this phone it's ok. Screen appearance and sound quality is also up to the mark. Fingerprint scanner is missing in this phone while fingerprint reader is working well.

"
"

  Worst phone 👎👎👎👎👎👎 not purchase it please..... Redmi is a cheap company fake battery performance and no chroma boostHangs a lot after few days of purchase ......, worst ever

"
"

  Superb phone. this phone I purchased for my 13 year old daughter for her online zoom classes. Two time she dropped the phone from her hand but thankfully nothing happens. This proves that this is quite hardy set too. She is happy with the phone because she don't have to charge it every after each class like before. One day full charge means no need to charge for nxt 2-3 days. Super.

"
"

  Very avg product. Got it for 8300 ..3/32 gb. Camera 2/5Display worst 2/5.Battery life 5/5.Performance 3/5.Audio (speaker)3/5.Overall 3/5.

"
"

  Don't be fooled this mobile isn't what they are showing!!  Battery isn't 5000 mah coz it hardly works only for one day...camera quality is not that good specially of front camera!!

"
"

  Best in this Price. Design is Amazing. I brought Sea Blue colour. Camera is Awesome, Portrait Mode is Outstanding. Battery Life is Really Good, easily last for One and Half Day even if you use your Smartphone Continuously.Now, the MIUI 11 is best SOS Based on Android 9 Pie.You Should Really Go For It.You will not be Disappointed.It is Best in this Budget.Very very very Happy...........🤗🤗🤗🤘🤘

"
"

  Before When I used redmi Note 5, I can't call any body at particular area...But now  BSNL tower is displayed and i can call everybody ...and camera is so good...Battery life i charged yesterday at 2:00PM 96% ... tomorrow till 10:45AM , 89% display , in Between cap i used data 2 Hrs, speak 1 Hr,

"
"

  All the phone specs in Redmi 8a Dual are great! but Redmi 8a Dual phone has a primary camera of 13+2 mp and  secondary phone camera of 8 mp. But the pictures clicked from the  primary camera are only 12 mp and the pictures clicked from secondary camera are only 6 mp.

"
"

  It's too good smart phone at budget price but there is no fingerprint scanner, slow processor but it's quite good at this price point and redmi provides type C port and 18 watt fast charging support, good grip design which doesn't come in other Brand smartphones.

"
"

  Good mobile but its made in china manufacture not made in india, so I am not satisfied. I heat china.

"
"

  I have already used redmi 4a which good for one and half year but after that phone started issues of touch problem and ghost touch problem, i frequently heard from friends who using redmi phones.Now new phone itself a problem though it seems not a great problem but led backlights in screen cleary visible in bottom. It seems okay now. But in future not sure about that. Will see for next few or i will return.

"
"

  Battery is average not good enough as given in specifications.As per specifications battery backup during video play back is 34 hours but I guarantee that you will have to charge it thrice in 34 hours.Charager becomes heat after 30 min of charging. And according to battery charger has low capacity to charge.I don't like this phone.I will have to return this phone.

"
"

  To be honest with you guys rhus phone is superbI am actually a heavy user an thus phone is perfectly perfect at this price. Battery is fabulous camera is just so clear (better then vivo and oppo) and display is also big but it only lacks at fingerprint by the way apple 11 series also doesn't have fingerprint so thisphine is perfect.Believe me guys this a smart choice and smart move too

"
"

  I am giving a Delivery day review!Looks good and I hope it'll work good as well! Used YouTube for a while and it got a little hot, I hope it's not a bad sign or something.And yaa it's a good phone at this range.

"
"

  User guide - Not able to read because of very small letters  and illegibleWarranty details not knownWhether this is having Finger print  identity>Detailed booklet on instructions and about REDMI 8A  dual 3 GB / 64 GB Storage not available  These items may be arranged for my referenceDisplay Brightness level  automatic adjustment  case is not clear

"
"

  I bought it on Apr.. now Jun 2nd... It's getting too heat... Not able to use it more than half hour.. it's getting too heat . Am not happy with the. Product. ....

"
"

  Phone performance good under this price. But the facelock feature is unlocking the mobile at a slower speed. Sometimes recognizing the face but not unlocking just shows facelock verifying, i need to enter the password to unlock. Facelock feature not working properly

"
"

  At 6500 price best phone I get the camera quality is also nic with this price and the over whole features is also nic.Night image is also ok ok because at this price we cannot except to much clearity but the image we can see is nic.

"
"

  Excellent product. Battery performance very good. Cleaner app effective. Feature of auto turn off at night and turn on in morning (savev on battery) effective. Camera is also very good.

"
"

  Battery and performance are good comparing to the price but 1 disadvantage is that this product came with 10w charger adapter this make it slow charging so you would prefer a batter charger adapter like 18w adapter but overall it is a very good product with less price👍

"
"

  1) Just its 2 days, now call center is saying hardware issue is there since it's not operating properly.2) Camera quality is poor3) Auto brightness mode doesn't work properly4) Wifi doesn't get connected, they are asking to check at service center.

"
"

  Very bad phone

"
"

  Pros:Battery life of the phone is good.Quick charge optionPicture clarity is good.Cons:Camera quality is not so greatLil heavierWith in a month , the power charger isn't working.All the videos are played in slow motion as there was no sync between the motion and the audio.. I had to install the VLC for playing the videos.

"
"

  On box the list of contains was there. In which gorilla glass was mentioned.. but on opening of box, we found only poly cover of gorrilla glass but gorrilla glass was missing.. which indicates that the item gorrilla glass was intensively removed from the mobile box before dispatched..  which is directly cheating with customer... not good... the dispatcher should be blacklisted..

"
"

  this is ultimate budget mobile in this range. and the battery life is just awesome. my mom use it . and she needs to charge it once a week. just a quality mobile

"
"

  Battery drains a lot. 5000 mah .is useless. even with average usage, it lasts only a day. Even in stand by battery drains.Its only the price and decent performance that I have given it 3 star else would have chosen only 1 star.

"
"

  Low Quality mobile...Don't buy  1).Sometimes Touch not work  2).Camera Quality is Average  3).Many adds are coming  4).App icon size are large  5).Does not moving files to sd card Overall this mobile is Waste...Battery only best but all performance are poor..touch not work,No sd card move i am very irritating...Choose another mobile at this price range

"
"

  Received the cell 8dual in proper condition. Thanks Amazon, but the warranty card, user guide and sim pin was missing. Please do the needful. Before dispatching please go through the item . Rest is fine

"
"

  This is my first time to order this phone online. It is really amazing. My friend told me not to buy phone online due to defect but i took a risk n i saved 1000/- bcoz market price is around 8500/-But they were wrong there's no defect.I really love it... N battery life is also very good... Thank you Amazon❤

"
"

  I was Micromax Q334 which has 5 Mp. camera which is far far better than RedMI 8A Dual 13 MP camera. Battery backup is good but it takes so much time to charge , approximately 2 hours for full recharge. and rest are good

"
"

  Pro- Slim and easy to handle- best in price- overall experience is goodConc- Mi unwanted apps-dont like MI operating that muchIt should be easy to use

"
"

  Battery back is very poor. It takes 3 hours for fully charge the phone and drain in 10 hours with normal use.Don not go for this mobile if you want good battery back up. The battery claim is false.

"
"

  Friends, never buy this mobile, it's a fault mobile. My mobille facing battery problem and display issue after 8 days of delivery. Both MI and Amazon refuse to replace. MI service is very poor and so guys never choose this mobile. MI service center informed me that 10 days replacement warranty is applicable for Flipkart only. I don't know what to do. Anyway I cheeted by MI and Amazon.

"
"

  Very comfortable product.  Good battery life also. They not provide phone back cover.  The fresh phone how to without use of back cover.  Please add back cover in this type phone.Camera clarity average. Face recognition perfect. Sound clarity, display size also good.  No fingerprint reader in this product then why you add  Star review on fingerprint reader in this page. I can't understand that.

"
"

  Good average phone little costlyCan get infinix with major upgradeCamera not worth itProcessor fineMemory fineIts averageIts too costly

"
"

  One of the worst phones out there, it started to hang in just one month I didn't expect that with a new device. All of a sudden the screen goes blank and keeps blinking battery is decent, camera is ok for this price but the performance is worst and one more upsetting factor that i did noticed after receiving no fingerprint sensor

"
"

  I loved the product battery life is good. Display and camera qaulity is ok.But I am very much disappointed with dilevery boy (Satish) he was very rude, even he was not following the rules for Covid-19. I have done shopping in past from Amazon and flipkart but never experienced this kind of behavior from dilevery boy

"
"

  I buy this mobile . battery  is awesome more than 1 day it's life.Battery charging time - 2.30 hrs with 2amp chargerCamera - averageProcesser - slow  while simple usage its frame dropTime for opening an app back to home screen is 2-3 sec which is very high. Some bug are still after update. Please resolve it

"
"

  Battery life goodPerformance not goodSome times it's not properly respondingCamera not a good oneAlways signal loosing

"
"

  Overall worthy smartphone• Battery life so good• Camera is good for daily need purpose• Display better result• fingerprint not available but faceunlock works.

"
"

  In this price range it is a good choice. Battery life is good. No lag till now. But camera should be better. Low light photography is very poor. Camera always suffer from low light. Selfie camera is decent. Overall a budget phone for day to day work. Don't expect more from this.

"
"

  If you thinking to buy a budget phone redmi 8a dual is great package.negative side-1)You don't get fingerprint scanner2)Even it is redmi phone you didn't get IR Blaster means there is no option of MI remote.3)camera is decent. Portrait mode is not that good.4)This phone supports 18w charger but you get 10w charger in box.5)you didn't get case in box.

"
"

  The display started failing 2 days after the return period ended. Started to automatically open and close apps. Screen would randomly go black, go to the lockscreen and unlock automatically. Since it started failing just after the return period ended makes it seem like this is a planned SCAM. I would recommend not to buy this phone.

"
"

  What a awesome service by Amazon!! Even in this pandemic time, really impressed.Amazon delivered the product on time.Phone is really good, I gifted this phone to my parents and they liked it. Reasonable price with all features.

"
"

  This phone one of good this price range, c type charger, dual camera 8 mp front, 5000mah battery

"
"

   Good battery backup, decent camera & bright display at this price point but there is no finger print censor and the other hand delivery time is also once again 60% faster than Flipkart.

"
"

  This is the best mobile I have ever seen under budget, ❤❤❤this mobile is good for all , easy to use, various themes are their . Good camera clearity. You can play pubg without any glitch. Two sim slot. And the speaker is owsmmmm.. The sound is tooo loud... Which is great for music lovers 😍😍😍😍. You can go for it.... This is like""CHOTA PACK BADA DHAMAKA""

"
"

  this is China product and take a lot of confusion while operating. Apps and software not updated as per new Indian rules. Getting confussion and delay in operating the phone

"
"

  No finger print available.Battery life is better.Camera is average. sound quality is better. Overall it's avg phone with this range of 8k.

"
"

  It has no fingerprint.Battery life is good.Camera quality for this price segment is very good.No lag.Overall it is a good choice for this price segment.

"
"

  No ir ,no fast charger in the box,but great phone with good processes and battery,camera ok ok, look great,in hand feel owsome

"
"

  At this price range this is the best phoneYou can do decenet gamingCamera is awesomeBattery backup nearly 10hrs continuous useCharges in 2 and half hoursPhone is very strong with tempered glass I dropped nearly 10 times from 5feet height no single damageIf your budget is below 10k this phone will reach your expectations

"
"

  Samsung m30 is best performer for a 10k phone. Camera is good and chinese phone cameras are nowhere close to it. Massive 5000mah battery with 15w fast charging. Only issue is battery heats even after a 5-min call. Samsung please bring some update to fix it. SAMSUNG is amazing.

"
"

  The phone comes at an attractive price yet offers good features, particularly the battery. There are many apps from mi that might get a tad annoying, make sure to switch off notifications, an easy work around.Camera and sound quality are decent. Phone performs and responds well.

"
"

  Display remain in that photo shownThat mobile does not any activities.Care persons not contact to that problem after inform to customer careVery worst responseCustomer care every time I call they told transfer to senior and after 5 mins call will be disconnected they rotene 5 times my money total waste.next time I don't buy on that website total cheet

"
"

  Best mobile in class because it has Qualcomm Snapdragon processor and type C port with 18w fast charge , and Qualcomm quick charge 3 support, it's better then redmi 9A, Redmi 9i.

"
"

  Satisfactory phone because of it's price!! A fine offering for ₹8000 phone but the issue of hanging continuously and the high heating problem makes me angry!!!No heavy apps are installed still after only 1 month of use such problems are arising....It's better to go for ₹10000 Or more but not this one!!

"
"

  I AM FIRST TIME USER OF REDMI PHONE.AT THIS COST THIS PHONE IS BEST.P-HONE IS WORKING SMOOTHLY.ALL GAME ARE RUN SMOOTHLY. NFS RUN OKAY.BATTERY LIFE IS GOOD.CAMERA QUALITY IS NOT GOOD. BELOW AVERAGE.FINGERPRINT READER IS NOT AVAILABLE IN THIS PHONE.

"
"

  Good product,only 2 colour variant only available to improve the colour variant and then,expand RAM space and ROM,Good looking,I feeling like heavy weight,Quick charging all very good working,No fingerprint,Good camera,Gaming performance was ok,Battery life good

"
"

  Mobile hanging intermittently, sometimes touchscreen not responding. Camera quality is not satisfactory. I was using different models of Redmi mobiles since last few years. But it's bye bye time... Amazon not returning this mobile within stipulated time frame 26/08/2020 from purchase date 18/08/2020.

"
"

  If you planing to get best looking phone for nearly 7000 redmi 8a dual is the best option to buy among all others. Display is right on part, battery is awesome, supports fast change 2.0 (18W), cemera is decent for video calls, and fells like durable device on hands.

"
"

   Mobile is so light weighted,and thanx to amozon to delivered timely. Camera picture quality very good and i give 10/10 for performance.

"
"

  Its a really good model at this price range. With good battery life and great camera quality. It also comes with 32gb internal memory and 2 gb ram which is also quite good. Fast charging and gaming speed is good too.And redmi is a very well-known brand.If you don't want much high featured mobile then its for you. Give it a try

"
"

  Pros-First look: Great built quality, looks like a 13k phone not 7.5k.Display quality seems like full HD.Camera quality (front and back) better than Motorola g5s plus(13MP) and portrait mode is great at this price point.Cons:Slightly lagging appears.

"
"

  Very bad. When calling the voice of other person is not clear. I think some kind of defect with my handset. Kindly guide me how to claim warranty?

"
"

  The phone was working well for a few weeks. Then suddenly started shutting down in middle watching a video or WhatsApp. It's been only 3 months since I have purchased this one. This was the first experience of smart phone for my Mom. Can't be a more pathetic experience. I need help to exchange this. I am unable to find a way to reach out. Please help.

"
"

  Noooo fingerprint s there..bt ask fr d ratings of finger print 😂..therz nly face unlock .... Mbl S gud enough with some latest apps.... Overall pick up some gud n reasonable..

"
"

  i bought it for my grandpa. this is good phone. not a gaming focused phone but will get your daily task fairly easily.it heats up during charge but its normal for 18w charger.if you want a daily driver and if you dont game that much then go for it. if you want a budget gaming phone then check realme c series.

"
"

   Hello Sir, We are buying a phone from amazon and it delivered on 10th sept,2020 and return timeline complete on 17th Sept, 2020 and today i found a problem like attached photo and videos. we are used this phone in my hand and  accidently stop working. I hope please replace the product as soon as possible.

"
"

  Excellent phone in budget segment... Camera quality is good.. Battery life 52 hours and 528 hour standby.. No lag.. Good performance.. You can use Google lence without any app.. Good quality.. Dual volte and VOwifi support.. I loved it also thanks to Amazon for fast delivery.. Miui 12 update has arrived in this phone. The phone you should buy in this time..

"
"

  I am writing the review after 20 day use. This phone have no finger print sensor. But battery life is ok. Camera quality also good. Selfi camera not so good but budget wise it's a good phone. Everything is very good in this range.

"
"

  A mid-range phone with every necessary features. The design of the phone is superb. An all day use phone and you don't need to exercise regularly with charging your phone. The audio quality and mic works at par. However, if you are looking for a camera phone it may not reach upto your expectations. It's an ideal handset to gift it to your parents.

"
"

  As expected an Mi product of topnotch quality. Unmatched configuration and features at the price. Best value for money. MAde in India.

"
"

  I bought this product for my grandmother. She doesn't need high end configuration. It has been 15 days or so and she is very happy with it. Battery life is really good and phone is decent looking. Easy to work with. Nice for day to day simple usage. Cannot comment on heavy duty usage as my grandmother doesn't need it.

"
"

  Don't have finger print sensor. Battery life is good in new condition butI have listened that battery life will be degraded after use of some months.Also one bad thing is the poor quality of pictures taken by rear camera instead of having dual rear camera. Pictures taken by rear camera is too dark in quality.

"
"

  So i bought this phone on 5th march 2020 for my mother. It went smooth because anyway she doesnt use phone apart from call and whatsapp. Now since 2 days the phone is not starting. It hanged first, when i she switched off phone to restart and again tried to start, it failed.its been 2 days the phone is dead. Its hardly 2 months. Highly disappointed. Poor quality of product.

"
"

  This mobile is nice but there is a problem in it when I call someone it couldn't call then I have to reboot it and then it works I have to reboot it at least three times in a day . It's the major problem in it but the camera and battery life are superb. There should also be a fingerprint scanner. I give the mobile three stars from five stars .

"
"

  Great mobile at this price rangeAmazing look.. Love the sea blue colour.. Good Battery Life and Good Camera Quality.. It doesn't have a fingerprint reader but Face Recognition is available

"
"

  I ordered a 2 GB RAM version earlier for one of my family member that worked fine. But this 3 GB RAM version started giving problems after 2 weeks of use. The screen often starts blinking and the phone has to be restarted again and again. The return window was closed. I think this is pathetic phone. Don’t buy it.

"
"

  I didn't find a finger print reader in this phone it was strange for me , the battery life is good , camera quality is ohk ohk , the phone have a face reader for unlocking the phone , I didn't tested it till now I would update the review after testing it , but it's good for normal use ..

"
"

  After using this about 6 month. I got this for 6500.Its really worth it in this range. Except camera every thing is upto mark.Battery backup is awesome.Paisa Wasool.

"
"

  the looks from the front is as same as redmi note 8 u’ll not find any difference, battery life is fantastic, audio quality is also good overall good smart phone and in this price point u won’t get the phone like this.Bit first let i thank and appreciate the Amazon, by sending this phone within no time and in good packaging

  Dont go buy the review of other if you spend 7.5k on a phone and you expect a performance of a flagship phone than its your problem.. This is a decent smartphone works flawlessly.. Camera is ok ok not that great but overall I didnt feel any lag ot any problem till now its been more than a month... Recommended👍👍

"
"

  Very good phone this price and very good specification and features this price...But fingerprint sensor not......

"
"

  Phone battery is not charging. I kept the phone for charging like crazy,,, but it's not working. Even if I charge for hours, it'll be having just 20%-30% charge. I really need a replacement. Please someone help me. It's been just 20 days I ordered this and return data also crossed. I am so much disappointed with the product and return policy of this device. Someone help me...

"
"

  This phone is one of best entry level  smartphone under 10k with some valuable features like type c port with fast charging, Gorila glass 5 protection and Snapdragon processor better then P22/P25/A25 of mediateak .....

"
"

  Just waste of money. Worse experience with Amqzon ever. Display is shaking automatically after few minutes of using. Worst thing is that it charged 27% only after long 14 hours. I foumd no fingerprint whereas it's asking to review fingerprint.

"
"

  Its good in this price range and my cousins were using this from 2years,yet times it become slow but restart helps to fix things.

"
"

  First of all its chinese phone but manufactured in india and we indians have no option when we are choosing any phone below 10k so I found this redmi 8A phone. Phone quality is superb with 3 gb ram and 32 gb internal storage with Microsoft sd card and AI camera is awesome. no hang just use it and go for it.

"
"

  Good Phone at this Budget. Sound is clear and loud. Camera quality good at day time. 5000 MaH battery is better than other phone, may operate for whole day with good usage.Except for the chinese apps and update, not sure, it would update or not.

"
"

  After approx 15-20 days of use... It's screen start getting freeze and sudden shutdown unable to access anything further...When contacted to customer care... They just keep it for 7 days amd replaca as it is...It is still giving problem while using yet customer care doesn't replace or help with anything.

"
"

  The mobile was really good at this price.There is no fingerprint reader,camera quality is ok and the battery was awesome.It stays for a long.Budget friendly  mobile.It is not fit for gaming and it is a better choice for online class.Hope this review helps you:)

"
"

  (1) I guess camera used to be better in the earlier Redmi phones.(2) The buttons on the side (volume, power) gets accidentally pressed often. Sometimes fast boot opens.(3) Phone doesn't feel very safe to hold. I constantly feel like I'll drop it. Perhaps it's due to size.

"
"

  Within 3 months of purchase the phone crashes and hangs a lot . It’s used for only whatsapp and YouTube mostly. Such simple applications cause phone not responding and requires a restart . I bought this as gift to my mom who handles it so previously yet the phone is a huge let down my first redmi phone. Doubt if I will ever return Redmi. Hope some patch or fix can improve it

"
"

  3gb 32 gb : Without any heavy app. installation and even , phone get hang ,reboot is only option in such cases.Except above issue , battery, camera, sound ,design,display are pretty good in this range

"
"

  The colour of the ph is outstandingBut it's have only the outlook,Inside the phone is not satisfiedLittle bit of lag, 720 pixels regulation,☹️DisgustingOnly the battery is good but the charging time is 2.50-3 hours to get 0 to 100%Really not satisfiedBetter you can buy resmi 8a in less price but same phone

"
"

  Display is destroyed so not available this item when available

"
"

  Fantastic phone quality, great experience..First time i am using redmi and great performance at this Price..Qualcomm processor fantastic job and battery perform first class, camera also good job..And I would to true say the phone quality fantastic.

"
"

  #Desh ka Dumdar Phone by Redmi India.I suggest to you go for this. Amazing Mind-blowing Product. Also, In this phone fingerprint reader is not present. But for budget phone award goes to this under 7500rs. Superb

"
"

  Good Phone, so far working fine, in this price range you can pick this phone, has good quality camera and ram management is also fine.Best part its battery life. In normal usage may be 2 day backup

"
"

  MI phones are worst in quality. It's hanging too much even when I only have 4 simple apps. When in loud speaker mode, even speaker and Mike both seems to be not working properly only after 20 days. Phone is having heating issue & they are having worst service center as they never provide quality service.

"
"

  This is Really Amazing in this price point 😘It has recently received Android 10 update.Battery runs two  days while light usage.Camera is more than average.Long Shots are Awesome.It is enough powerful to run GTA SA, Free Fire on Ultra settings.In my opinion it should be priced around 7,000₹.

"
"

  I bought it for mom..c is newto andriod.. In this price.. Product is good.. Camera n fingerprint reader is good.. Battery depends on use.. Apps..

"
"

  I bought this phone for my dad he isn't a gamer so I tkoght 2GB RAM would be enough and yeah it's enough for daily useBattery stays for a whole day or two with full brightness YouTube streaming I don't know  about that..There wasn't a fingerprint reader that was a bummer but yeah for 7.5k it meets the requirements

"
"

  Very good mid range phone. But the camera quality is not up to the mark. Pubg and codm runs smoothly but gyroscope is not good.heats on charging like any other redmi phone.

"
"

  Awesome smartphone at this price range. Nothing beats it. Nice smooth processor for normal usage. Not for gaming though.

"
"

  Good battery backup and it gives more than 8 hours screeen ontime for one complete charge but in case you are interested in Wireless FM Radio then this is more than dispointment. Xaiomi should be sued for such wrong publicity about  wireless FM radio.

"
"

  this mobile is super everything is great battery backup camera display all is avesam and its design is very impressive I like this mobile very much in this budget is mobile is superb you should for go for it

"
"

  Picture quality is very much bad for the bad camera quality.I sugest try other option which is better then this phone.Most problematic MI stores also, every time required update.

"
"

  Nice mobile according to price, camera more than average, everything is good I am happy with this product. Only one problem at the time of incoming call, when we cover proximity sensor, screen turns off and only rings, we have to on screen from the side button, it's solution is you can on the raise to wake option. Thnx to Amazon

"
"

  I 1st time purchased mi phone & as I thought it’s exactly like that WORST PRODUCT, software issues as you can see in upload video, apps automatically start running, very irritating experienceRequest DONT WASTE MONEY TO BUY THIS PRODUCT

"
"

  Not good for long use, battery camera not up to the mark

"
"

  Its a good Budget mobile .Battery back up is good , it really is 5000mAh battery.Camera is Good but  dont expect High quality Pics .

"
"

  Goodphone

"
"

  First impression ,Good .I bought this for my mom(Amma). Detailed review soon

"
"

  Schedule power on and off and find device options are not working though I followed direction provided by mi customer care and factory data reset. There is a problem in software. Company should notice the problem and customer should notice. Thanks for the replacement initiation.

"
"

  It is lightweight and I like the look. Battery backup is nice. Camera is average. Not like dslr. 😁Processor is fast.

"
"

  Phn isntoo gud but amazon cheat me they cant give me charger.  Nd when I complained they said to self return this product

"
"

  Overall This Mobile is good.1. Bad Camera quality. Selfie camera is good.2. Good battery life3. Slow Mobile4. Back side cover quality is not good5. Better to have good quality pouchIt is suitable For normal usage people

"
"

  Very good battery back up. I watched You tube for 1.5 hours and only 10% battery consumed.Good mobile in such a cheap price.

"
"

  I will never suggest anyone to buy this phone. Now a days quality of mi phones are getting degraded. Phone is hanging a lot. Also some inbuilt feature like screen shot is not working. Not a good phone. Only plus point is battery life, which is good. But apart from that other aspects of a good phone are very poor.

"
"

  It's one of best mobile in low budget, but not good quality of camera. Good for online access, surfing. Not good for video game player.

"
"

  Excellent product ..!1) good touch quality2) HD screen3) Good camera quality4) nice design.Finally great product & affordable price.!

"
"

  I received a used device. The pin wasn't there, cardboard was broken.After switching it on, it didn't ask for my Google account. Home page ooened straight away. I cleared the data and it locked me out saying someone's MI account is already linked to it and now I'm unable to even turn on my phone

"
"

  Performance has been docile after 3 weeks of use.Battery is indeed exceptional along with several other features that make this phone distinctive in the marketplace.However camera quality could have been massively upgraded.Finger print sensor should have been present.Otherwise Okayish in the price range.

"
"

  India's most third class brand is Mi. Not satisfied with this product at all. From the very first day I faced issue. Recent app key does not work properly. Recent app areautomatically dilited. Poor camera quality. Setting is very complicating. Full of 3rd class features. The only satisfactory thing is its battery.

"
"

  Super phone with great look and battery back up. Phone pic and video quality is great.

"
"

  It's a very good product for budget price in lockdown,,battery very good, this is Speacilaty of this product,, over all this phone is very good,, I am very happy to get this product due to study purpose. Thanks to Amazon to gave cod on this product,.

"
"

  Product is good but it's not made in India .It's made in ChinaClearly written on boxIt's imported from China .

"
"

  Just after 42 days, the phone started misbehaving, from any section of mobile it is coming back to home screen automatically in less than a minute, MIUI experience is not good, faulted phone is sent by seller and Mi company, Amazon please look into this, please compensate, I am hurt

"
"

  Battery capacity given 5000maH but actually not like that, battery capacity actually proven for 3000mah. The draining speed is as same as 3000 or less mah. Overall the performance is good but in a term of battery capacity little compromised whether it's internal falut or battery problem that cannot be understand.

"
"

  I purchased 3Gb RAM Variant at rs 8500 and I think it is overpriced as it's camera, processor, screen quality is very bad.

"
"

  The screen of the Redmi 8a is pretty good under Rs 8,000 price phone.I've purchased it for my Mom🥰...She is very happy with this SURPRISE.t has a light weight,thin that you are very easily use for the daily life. 🙂But not really satisfied with the camera quality😢

"
"

  Sir product is hanging a lot from past 20 days . I reboot & updated it 5-6 times still problem continues.  Also there is no replace or warranty option given by you. Extremely disappointed from amazon service . Please solve my problem .There is something very wrong with the software of this product.

"
"

  Till date no issues, good working. I don't think there may be any problems. Good one in this range. No fingerprint reader. Camera is average.

"
"

  the phone is so much laaging .we cant play pubg ,ff  smoothly .the best thing i like  in this phone its battery performence and the back design .

"
"

  i dont why sellers took 8 days for shipping. what he was doing (preparing for refurbished?) i didnt get free basic transparent pouch in side the box. he is too late to ship the product. Apario pvt ltd

"
"

  This phone is good only very for normal user 2gb ram hang this phone sometime.but note its battery is awesome call quality is good speaker is average, design is also good not slippery camera is average, and what u get in jst 7499

"
"

  Best Phone in the price segment. Built quality, camera performance and battery backup is awesome. It's Redmi so we get everything best in affordable price.

"
"

  The phone is good but the camera quality is very poor. It has a written 13 megapixel camera, but it takes pictures like a 5 megapixel camera. No good photo can be taken at night. Overall a good phone, but not recommended for those buying for the camera..

"
"

  I have doubts regarding manufacturing and import date of product. As Date of manufacturing is June 20 and date of import is July 20 . How it's possible that phone is imported in India in July 20 which yet to be come

"
"

  I bought this phone on 3rd march. Returned on 7th march due to mal function. They sent me one more cell but im facing the sane problen. It always tell 'find device closed unexpectedly'. Due to this problem im unable to open some apps like whatsapp and youtube. Even im unable to open camera app some times.

"
"

  Best phone

"
"

  During incoming call display is not showing , we have to unlock the phone to see who is calling.we also wnet to MI center , they reported sensor is not working properly.Please don't buy this phone . Increase the buget if possible to buy other phone. my friend also bought this phone and also received defective one.

"
"

  It doesn't contains Fingerprint reader, Battery life is OK. Again We are so dissatisfied with the camera Quality. Overall this phone is not so satisfying but till it's ok to have this phone !!!

"
"

  Got the budget phone @7499 For 2 gb-32 gb , truly needed for Online Classes, I also suggest to sale at previous discounted price with more choices. Phone is nice, with clear display, Sound is good, Network connectivity is good. Basic needs fulfilled.

"
"

  I purchased it for my mother ... a really very nice product...cam quality with AI  is also good .....Battery life awesome... sound quality good...MIUI 11 supporting system....fast charging with 18 W plug....Go for it..best budget phone

"
"

  Dear everyone,Please don't purchase this phone. after 15 days of purchased, the display not working properly. Automatically many app opening and closing without touching phone. Some software issues is there. But they telling good option within the budget range. Totally waste of money...

"
"

  A budget smartphone , not expect much.Display is quite satisfactoryBattery lasts for one and a half day if you use constantly.No finger print sensorNo gravity sensorCamera is above averageLacks night escape modeCharger heats up a lot during charging

"
"

  Battery got discharged in one night. It was just kept aside without sim and wifi. Will check other features after the phone is charged.

"
"

  The mobile is only 7 days old & the processor is malfunctioning.The product could not be returned within 7 days as the return request could not be processed due to tedious policy of self check could not be materialized.Very very disappointed.

"
"

  Product and service of Amazon is good. I have purchased this mobile in Rs. 8299/- marginally Price is high.Drawbacks- Pre installed app like mi account, mi browser, mi store, mi video , mi pay, mi credit, shareMe and mi community. Which leads to unnecessary memory's cosumption.

"
"

  Nice phone at this priceProsBattery lifeGood displayGorilla glass 5 protectionSD 439 energy efficiency 12nmMIUI interfaceConsAverage cameraNo finger print censorOutdoor visibility in direct sunlightNo IR Blaster

"
"

  Bought this for my mom.  This mobile set is dazzling and has great appeal.  Such a good set at such less price!!

"
"

  It serves all my needs. Display, camera are satisfactory. Signal capturing capability is really good. Touch response time is normal. Battery life is also sufficiently good.

"
"

  The whole mobile set and its functions are very good as compared to it's price. The phone doesn't have fingerprint sensor but camera and battery life are very good. Satisfied with my purchase.

"
"

  Good product and worth ...ideal phone for only calling and whtsp ..since it has less ram and storage ... suitable for eldersAverage cameraBattery doesn't drain muchA bit slow ..not really slow!The back cover has a rough texture , better grip

"
"

  Product was working fine, with this budget got a 3GB RAM,32GB storage mobile and Camera pixels also more as compare to competitors products,It’s simply worthy. And Good product.

"
"

  This product is exalent. Mi 8a dual phone is very intalegent mobile, superb quality. Mi is company quality first rank really great technology, with dolby, dts sound in ear phones. Thank you amazon, ilke phone, one million ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐,,,,,.....

"
"

  This is the best mobile I've ever bought. One thing that i like about it is... It never hangs and processor is damn fast mtlb amazing😍.  But the one thing only i dislike about this device is the design.... When it comes to its design its a Lil bit odd. But overall this phone is amazing.

"
"

  Dislikes: not two day battery, screen resolution Dotty, MI apps useless and can't be uninstalled.Likes: best option below 10k, better than Samsung, satisfactory ownership.

"
"

  Not expected this quality from MI, only after 7 weeks of using its sound speaker is not functioning, mobile also hangs frequently, also getting hot during long calls, worst quality got.As a true customer, If possible, request MI to change the mobile with new one.

"
"

  Budget mobile.....Worthy for money....Little bit disappointed by the processor ....Could have been upgraded but speed is very good for normal user rather than gamers......Especially battery is tooooo goooood .......Type C charger is an advantage..With 18w charger

"
"

  Ear Speaker noise is very less as compaired to Redmi 6A always need to use on speaker. Unable to heard properly so creating miss understanding. Good product in this Price. Battery life good but need to also improve. Selfies camera is awesome.. As compaired to other same specifications this is very good👍👍

"
"

  Good quality. Finger print sensor not yet used. Battery and camera are good. Pre-installed apps are a problem

"
"

  I would rate this product ZERO.. pls do not buy this product waste of money..After inserting the sim the phone is always switched off.  Due to this had got the SIM also changed but the issue of the phone continues.. same sim works on other phone perfectly fine.

"
"

  Budget phone under 10000 and specs are quite impressive but when it comes to camera it's almost similar to redmi 7a...and battery life is okay-okay...fast charging support with type-c charger...face unlock okay-okay...performance amazing...attractive look(sky white)..₹8299 is worth it..

"
"

  It's a amazing phone📱. It's battery has a great power which is long lasts. And fast charging is also super duper. There's no fingerprint reader but other securities performs there best. It's camera quality is good and best selfie it's auto focusing is fantastic. Loving it

"
"

  Battery - 10 marksCamera - 7½ marks.(In this budget price it's worth but the image can be more brighter)Performance - 8 marks. Has good dual 4G speed and shows no lags while playing games.Overall - 8 marks

"
"

  Don't know, but I ordered this phone and returned it.Received new piece again.But same issue with this phone as well , microphone issue,Not able to hear voice of person who is on the other side.Now going to return this phone and will purchase other phone but not Redmi 8a

"
"

   After 9 day phone display is flickering. When I called to customer care, they simply told me we can't help you, your return window is closed. No support received from Amazon.

"
"

  A good phone in this price range. Back camera got good quality. Front camera is little bit low quality.

"
"

  Backcolur is White & its awesome, camera is as always average for redmi products but processor is good compared to same range realme mobile.

"
"

   Very bad quality. Speaker and mic  Very bad quality. Speaker and micVery bad quality. Speaker and micVery bad quality. Speaker and micVery bad quality. Speaker and micVery bad quality. Speaker and micVery bad quality. Speaker and mic

  Nice product by Redmi. A budget smartphone for everyone. Nice battery backup. Nice design. And Amazon service is also very good, delivery agent is very polite. Overall a good experience with Amazon Service. I hope Amazon will provide this flexible service everytime and to everyone.

"
"

  Looking great product 👌.I am looking back cover but hasn't in.selfi camera looking great.packing is good... delivery is well...it has 20 gb storage with phones applications... Snapdragon 439 good processors in the mid range....8300rs...thank you amazon....

"
"

  Hanging, screen not working properly. Didn't work any swhich at time of hanging.very bad feedback from my side.

"
"

  Good phone. Bit bulky may be because of big battery. Awesome back camera, average front camera. No lagging. Overall good budget phone. Ideal for elderly people.

"
"

  Pretty bad performance. Battery drains out in few hours (max 4 hrs) camera quality is not great could have gone for other brands with the same range.

"
"

  Basically A phone for Basic Usage.. If u are a Gaming person don't go for this one but if u hv to give it to ur parents or u urself has limited usage u can give this phone a shot.Totally worth it.Value for money phone.

"
"

  After using for 1 week, I am writing this review the fon is awesome, the battery is good and the camera is also good, mostly it is good fon for the parents.

"
"

   5 दिन में Redmi 8A dual का touch खराब हो गया । शिकायत पर कोई रेस्पॉन्स नहीं।मेरे खराब अनुभव के आधार पर redmi का कोई फ़ोन नही खरीदे। 0 स्टार

"
"

  Older text messages goes up. This phone has a limited memory for text messages. It approx saves 100 messages per number. Beyond a certain limit, older messsages diasppear. If I knew this, I never buy this phone.

"
"

  The phone was fine but the charger was not workingIt is a faulty charger. i thought the phone was fine but with a new charger too, charging is not happening. I realised too late that the piece is a bad one.The changing port of the phone is itself faultyIt is a diffective peice

"
"

  Though Phone battery is great , the internal storage is wasted by installing too many un necessary apps. the worst part is that the in built antenna stooped working within few days of purchase and now has to use head phones for FM receiption.

"
"

  Good one. Had ordered for my dad and he seems at ease using the same. Appearance, colour, display, battery are all fine so far

"
"

  2gb ram gets phone slow.

"
"

  Low in price, big screen, good for normal use. People who have low budget, this is very nice. Also got it on emi, it also went smooth.

"
"

  No fingerprint sensor, normal charging speed, camera not bad, pubg play with gfx tool in extreme setting smoothly but gyro repond veey slow (not work properly).This phone made only normal usage.

"
"

  Overall performance of the phone is good, The battery when compared to other phones in same price range is weak , camera is pathetic, display is not bad ..

"
"

  Excellent phone at competitive price. Great value for money. People looking for low budget phone with comparable features of high end, can blindly opt for this phone and make it ranking no. 1 in mobiles

"
"

  I regret buying this after I got to know that I could have bought note 6 pro at slightly higher price, which is better phone then this one :(

"
"

  I gave this phone as a gift to my Sister and she loved the phone. The charger received along with the phone was faulty and did not charge, I called up Amazon however the entire product had to be returned and was also out of stock, there was no option to retutn the charger and hence I did not return it.

"
"

   Defective piece delivered and now not replacing it.because problem had seen in mobile after 10  days of deliverybso now they are not replacing it... Very bad service.. Not satisfied at all

"
"

  Damdar product at this price range. Battery is very good last long front camera is awesome, back panel and its colour looks very cool. Overall very best phone at this price range just go for it

"
"

  Liked display and notch area. Gives feeling of large screen. Happy about battery too. Cam is descent but could have been better for this price range.

"
"

  Battery life 3 days.smooth display. Classic look. fast charge. Good camera.average performence. 7500 price. Low padjet High range mopile

"
"

  Redmi 8a average budget friendly phone...i bought 2 redmi 8a dual.i felt some issues on automatic brightness .Normally it will be work under the light conditions but when i put it on,suddenly the brightness getting low then it will never back to normal light..both devices have same pblm..

"
"

  Good phone in this price range . Can’t expect much from the phone as it is sufficiently loaded.

"
"

  in this price range this is best smartphone for basic use.Its runs PUBG also on low settings but basically its not made for gaming purposes.This is best non gamer user like me who used only phones for calling and normal streaming purposes.And speaker of this phone is quite loud also.I likes this phone.

"
"

  A very good mobile, camera is not good,But performance is good,Recommended for day to day work

"
"

  I bought this phone for my momThe smartphone comes with a 5000 mAH battery. Large screen good camera.

"
"

  Overall a good phone with quite interesting specifications but not for youth they need more powerful processor and other specifications

"
"

  Good mobile at this price I mean it's such a budget friendly phone. And it's battery backup is great.

"
"

  Finger print sensor not available

"
"

  Thank you amazon.time to time delivery super.packaging is excellent.redmi note 8Adual.3gb,64gb mobile is super.

"
"

  Amazing product at this range i don't have to say battery backup is amazing and cameras just do what they are suppose to do, don't expect much from them, overall quality is amazing i love it.

"
"

  Faulty Product - The charger is faulty and the phone does not charge at all. Unfortunately I got the product during the start of lockdown and now I’m stuck with a faulty product without option of being able to return! Extremely unhappy and feel cheated !

"
"

  Good phone in budget price. Need to improve camera quality. Especially front camera needs improvement. Can give silicone cover atleast and charging can be improved fast front

"
"

  I just bought 2 days back..phone is ok  . But they have sent corrupt charger which is not working at all.. please replace it ...it never get charges more than 2 %... or refund my money  .Amazon  should take care of the products before delivering it . We can't wander to courier office often n often.

"
"

  The product was of very bad quality. Tried to connect Amazon on call, but due to lockdown, it was not possible. When I was connected, I told them that volume button is not working, they said try after restarting the phone. That problem still persist and every time I have to restart the phone to operate volume button.

"
"

  This phone gives you a lot of features which doesn't come in other brands in the same price range. Battery is good, camera is okay and fingerprints works just fine. If you have low budget you can go for this phone.

"
"

  Redmi 8A Dual I bought this mobile some months ago & after using this I can bet this is the best mobile phone in such a cheap price...Battery life is good Camera quality is ok ok but only Fingerprint is not in this phone otherwise good for working people.

"
"

  Camera: The camera quality is not good when considered for portrait shoot. Images are not sharp, you will find the camera to be tiny and not a great build.Body build quality: Worth the moneyRAM: Okay, as its not a gaming mobileAI face unlock: Good

"
"

  This is made in China. Imported in 07/2020. Beware.

"
"

  Top class 👌spec's in it's price.well design 🤟by Xiaomi . Value for money.Most of the people who have buy a new phone in this price range they have one thing in the mind that's value for money. And it is that. 🙏Excellent 👍 service by Amazon .

"
"

  Basically  this phone is bought for my mom and she loves it .She is happy what is product  offer to her .But there is only issue with finger print sensor which is not given .

"
"

  Ok ok ,not soo  better go for samsung ...Nothing about this product 3.8 ratingopen light camera  is good 5 ratingBut inside house camera 2.5U decide

"
"

  The Screen starts flickering after use of a Month! Without any rough use of the Phone! Will suggest don’t do for this Phone Rather u can get better of it with MI itself! Such a fault in Screen not tolerable.

"
"

  Worst product. It's feel like brick in hand.. so heavy . Phone hangs a lot and heating issues are there. OS is not fast and remember it produces lot of radiation ... don't go for it.

"
"

  The product seemed to be excellent for one month but then began to restart frequently, redmi customer care executive suggested to visit service centre, unable to visit service centre during lockdown. Pathetic experience for the first time from Amazon.

"
"

  There is no warranty card inside the boxNo ear phones connector tooAnd these days a screen guard and a transparent case are given to customers but in amazon theres nothing

"
"

  It get hang up within 2 week. After rebooting by calling customer care it's running ok but risk remains

"
"

  Review after 3 month useNice phone in this rangeGood cameraGood batteryFeel very good and nice look

"
"

  Dislike  :  Not head phone available with this packing.Like  : we like RedmiUse  : for my daughter.

"
"

  Looks very cheap. you can buy an advanced/better mobile by adding two-three thousand to your budget.

"
"

  it's a good product. face sensor is work very good.  it's camera battery life and over all performance is the fantastic with its price. i am so happy with mobile . back cover is not given with  mobile.

"
"

  In my set I am suffering from lost of network, I don't know why this occurs. SIM is tested on other mobile instrument no problem of network. In this set spoken to various times on customer care all test done as per there instructions but all in vein. Kindly help.

"
"

   This phone is worst......the screen start flickering after three to four days of use.

"
"

  Phone worked fine for 10 days but now m facing problems. Apps getting crashed, Opened my  contacts, Screen was automatically running.  when i called someone, screen goes turned off and did not turned on even after pressing power button multiple times.

"
"

  This phone is great from every aspect.I bought this phone for my mom.She was amazed to see the battery backup this phone has.Camera is good too for the price.If you're buying this phone for your mom or dad, then it's a great buy.

"
"

  The product is delivered in good condition.I am satisfied with the packagingI bought this smartphone for old person who only needs it for primary use such as camera whatsApp and calling purpose. Whosoever is buying this for basic purpose can definitely go with this product.

  Honest review for a Honest Samsung phone. I am writing this review after using M31s for more than half month. And my verdict based on truly improved Samsung M series with my experience & tested after usage only.BUILD QUALITY. Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. My hand is small but still I found 6.5 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT.With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M31s feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.BATTERY.Main benefit of this midrange M series is it's maasive 6000mAh battery which gave me enough juice for nearly 3 days continuously. Tested.CAMERA.This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 mwgapixel with Single Take feature. Samsung gives what it advertises. Which made me to stick to Samsung brand. My usage of Camera is high & I found no complaints at all in focusing a shoot. Good color saturated. Well bright night shots. Macro shots r OSM. The depth & clarity of 64 megapixel is more developed in this M31s model. So no complaints.PROCESSOR.After using for more than half month I must say, Exynos 9611 works wonderful liquid speed when it is combined with LPDDR4X RAM technology. I have not faced any lag in PUBG or ASPHALT-9 hight end games, in medium setting which is good for battery saving. So 2.3Ghz speed accomplished. No complaints for the budget spent.SOUND QUALITY.After using for hours I found the Speaker this time Samsung made is much improved with Bass Stereo which was missing earlier. The in-ear delivers your ear the pure Dolby Atmos with clear precision and crystal clear bass effect.Bang for the bucks go for it. Thanks Amazon for Safe delivery.

  Ordered on Prime day, 6th August 12 AM. Received the phone on 8th August.All aspects of the phone is on par or above the next segment.Display is gorgeous.Lookwise it doesn't feel like an M series phone.FP sensor works well although it can store only 3 fingerprints.Camera is overall good. Can't say it's a camera centric phone obviously. However it has some good outputs6000mah battery with 25W fast charging is awesome. (you get reverse charging as well).The only con i felt till now is the exclusion of a phone cover in the box. This might sound silly but I'm one of those guy's who use phone with a cover only to be on the safer side. Just because there is no cover I'm unable to use the phone as my daily driver right now.Come on Samsung. How much will a tpu cover cost for you?? 50Rs??M31s is actually A51 without on screen fp. It has better specs than A51 which retails around 8-9k than M31s which makes this phone one of a kind.The dimensions are also the same as A51. So you can use the same tempered glass but cant use A51 back cover for M31s since it should have the cutout for side mounted fp scanner.Overall a great phone. Value for money I should say. If you are not a heavy gamer this is the best choice around.Will update the review after using the phone for 2 weeks.Till then book your phone and wait for the delivery as it is back-ordered at this moment.

   This is to share my horrible experience with Amazon and Samsung. The phone arrived dead and I have to make multiple calls, emails to team to get it replaced. After technician report confirming that phone is dead they now asking me to go for a refund as product is no longer in stock.

  Strongly recommend No..why samsung make lot advertise on m31s.really don't know wt makes new compared to other M series. 'Single take' shot option really useless.People who r looking for camera please don't buy m31s.All the modes camers pictures are 95%blur mode.perfomance of mobile is not up to expectations.When turns into selife mode really shocked IS IT HD photo or Asian paints colored WALL.REALLY SHOCKED.THIS TIME SAMSUNG DISAPPOINTED.Videos display is also not so effective. Starting of series most of them said not  a gaming mobile.really its not gaming mobile.No samsung pay Nfc,No backcase,l.Rather than spending 20k on m31s supposed to switch another model.Name it as blur mobile.THANKS

  Initial impression after using for one day.1. The display is Gorgeous. Feels like a high end device2. Specs say 6000 MaH battery. Power management is not up to the mark. Without using any power intensive app battery drain is quite pronounced and noticeable.  Hopefully Samsung will release a patch to fix this3.Camera: Impressive.  Good lighting conditions result in beautiful and detailed shots. Struggles a bit during the low light conditions. Overall quite ok for the price.4. Processor: Not the fastest out there  but does the job. Nothing to complain about5. Fingerprint scanner is decent.6. No back case in the box. Will take time to get new case delivered.  Case is necessary as the back panel is quite slippery7. I believe the cost should have around 17K instead of 19.5k...! But if you want a non Chinese phone then this is a good option to consider

  I am using this for last 2-3 days now.This is my review after actually using this pgone in all aspects.Pros -1. Canera - Excellent camera - Good low light photography.  64 Megapixel does uts wor. Inteli Cam is just awesome.2. Display is just Superfine even in direct sunlight it works Excellent.Touch is just Excellent.3. Phone looks really cool in hands.4. Smart pop up feature is also good to have.5. UI is good.6. Speaker sound is good.7. No issues in calls - No call drips using Airtel sim.Overall its very nice experience using this phone.I researched alot before burying this phone and i am happy that i made this choice.Cons -1. Battery doesn't look like 6000 MAH it typically gives 1.5 days backup with single charge which other phone alao gives with relatively less Mah Battery.I was hoping to get little more backup2. Processor  - Could have been better3  No back cover for phone as it is hard to find in a market

  Don't buy anyone worst product, Waste of money rs 18000. This product too much heating, display quality very low and touch screen not working, Camara is very worst like 2mp Camara, also don't trust Amazon. I have ordered credit card payment. they cancelled orders and not refunded. I have raised complaint against Amazon but no use. don't purchase in Amazon. Samsung m31s hanging even I am not installed single game

  An excellent device would not be an enough word to describe this phone.Got it through prime and Amazon delivered it before time once again delighted with wonderful service by Amazon and the device is a masterpiece.Loaded with awesome features like 1 click camera, 6000mah battery, reverse charging, bigger and butter smooth super amoled display.Samsung has started to capture the Indian market and that ultimately allow us as customers to get rid of data stealer and spy Chinese phones.You can definitely go for this phone blindly

  Hi all,From Samsung M31s.Bought it on Amazon Prime day sale. Placed the order by 00:04 of 6th August (Day-1 of the sale) and got it very next day Noon 2pm itself. Kudos Amazon India.Grabbed it for 15,999 with a 2k coupon code and HDFC's 10% discount.But, ordered a Matte Back cover and Matte Temper glass (As it didn't come with the box and also wasn't available near me in Chennai). Delivery date is 18th to 25th Aug which is pathetic. I have to take care my SaM31s like a baby.Small review as per my knowledge -On-hand, its so good. (Earlier was using OnePlus 6) Size wise bit bigger that 1+6 (6.5"")Comparing to Nord, we have Memory card slot - no dependency.While updating the phone on first start, i felt bit heat. But later, it was fine.Charged a 100% and had an extensive usage (not a gamer). Battery lasts more than 36hrs (with Bluetooth earphone at times).Charging happened in 70-75 mins with intermediate usage in between.Earphone Jack available comparing to Nord, better than Bluetooth earphone which consumes charge and needs charge for earphones too.Settings - an ocean of settings, wonderful touch sensor and additional features for lock facilities.But, doesn't have indicator on the front face (which shows if notifications are received)No option to find app usage statistics.Audio - Its so good with clear audio in all needs.Photo - Video : Excellent quality of photos and Videos even in a 3x Zoom. Front camera is bit down.Macro Mode is giving a great pic of Close shots.Has Slowmo, Super slowmo, Hyperlapse, Panaroma.AR zone is pure magical. Different features for Front cam and Back cam.Reverse charging facility is amazing. But the box doesn't have USB - charge cable.Overall - M31s is a price worthy with sooo many options.EDIT : Corning Gorilla Glass 3 is fine,just on 10th day of my purchase, my phone fallen down with less than 1m height (slipped from hand) and display borken 💔Handle with care.

  This is my personal view n review.  I upgraded from ayear old Redmi note 7 pro to M31 s because i wanted a non Chinese phone & m31s promo claimed good camera  battery etc. After usage of a week, I am sure that this was a bad decision. This phone is overhyped n priced. 15k would have been the right price for it. Its camera is good but doesn't give you out of the world experience.  Battery is 6K but doesnt run even for 1.5 day under normal use. Plastic used on backcover is cheap, the Samsung chipset sucks, this phone should have come with snapdragon and in range of 15K. I am not liking to write this review but Samsung has disappointed again. Redmi or one plus phones are clear winners. I will return this phone.

  Upper portion of the phone is getting heated after using it for very short period.....and even when making a call for 2-3 minutes same thing is being experienced.....but lower portion of the phnoe seems fine...also called Amazon technical support to check about this....they checked my phone through servify app...told me all are ok....if anyone facing same thing....please let me know....is it a common issue?

"
"

  Pros :1. Display -- Amazing Super Amoled2. Battery -- Huge 6000mAh3. Camera -- Great especially the Single Take feature4. Reverse Charging -- Excellent, you can use this phone as a power bank as the cable in box is type c to type c5. Charger -- 25W fast charging6. UI -- Very good and easy to operate7. Fingerprint scanner on side is very Fast8. Gradient look is nice...Cons :1. Chipset still Exynos 9611 (10nm). This could have  been better at this price range....Over all ...Great product....👍4.5 on 5

  Don't buy this Samsung M31s.Camera quality is bad.Overall waste of money.

  I am writing this review after 3 days of moderate to heavy usage.Design: The design of the phone is stunning even though its made of glasstic. The back is a dust and fingerprint magnet. So suggest to use a case. 5/5.Battery: Monstrous. Lasted for a day after watching 2 movies, occasional checking of mails, light gaming and browsing social media. I still had 10% left. The highlight is of course reverse charging and the super fast charging support. Took around 100 to 120 mins to charge the phone completely from 0 to 100. 5/5.Camera: One of the best if not the best camera in this range. The Sony sensor does a great job in the imaging department with some intelli cam features. 4.5/5.Processor and UI: For the last 3 days, that I've been using this phone, UI was pretty smooth and with some bloatware. I am a stock android lover, so thankfully I was able to delete a few pre-installed apps and block the ads/app recommendations while setting up the phone. There are some cool features like smart pop up view which are really awesome. The processor was lag free and its performance was smooth. I don't want to comment on gaming as I am not a heavy gamer. Overall an great choice for day to day usage. 4.5/5.Display: No comments. Just 5/5.The only disappointment I had was there was no case provided in the box. Overall I would give 5/5 for this phone. Regarding the pricing, when I've compared it with the competitors for 6/128 gb variants there was a difference of 1k to 1500 which I felt was fine considering the Samsung brand and features offered.I would recommend this one if anyone is looking for a decent phone under 20k.

  Phone is heating and also camera is blurring when flash light is on. Worst camera ever.

  Though not a big samsung fan I purchased Samsung M31S immediately after India launch yesterday for 18K after HDFC discount for 6/128GB after waiting for nearly 2 months for Redmi note 9 pro max 6/128 which was at 17K then went to 18.5K due to tax and production issues coz of lockdown. It was impossible to buy in their weekly flash sales coz Redmi didn’t have enough stock.Out of frustration thought of buying Samsung M31 6/128 which was available at 16K then but the Exynos processor, old dewdrop front cam, rear fingerprint scanner and 15watt charger for 6K battery holded me back…My Lenovo P2 which I had purchased on launch day in Jan 2017 had speaker issues after 3.5 years of usage.. Service centre has closed down in my city and nowhere else speaker was available…but after Redmi stock issues and M31 shortcomings made me purchase speaker for P2 from amazon and still using the phone. Repaired a phone for the first time in my life. Lenovo P2 is most underrated phone. Best battery life ever. Even after 3.5 years I still get 9 to 10 hrs of screen time. Excellent.I have used samsung only once earlier….Note 3 Neo….gud phone intially but later started hanging and pathetic battery life…. So my main expectation after using Lenovo P2s huge 5100mah battery from 3.5 yrs was battery life as I am a heavy user though I never play games.Though M31s processor may not be great for gaming etc it’s gud for normal usage. All my other concerns of M31 were overcome by M31s like punch hole camera, side fingerprint, 25 w charger, attractive design with side frame etc. Also Sony IMX 682 sensor and new camera features were add on.Also in Amazon sale got it for just 500 more than M31 and 500 less than Redmi note 9 pro max during normal sale when I intended to buy 2 monthsago… (6/128 model)I had also considered Poco X2 coz of its camera but was put off by its 4500 mah battery. Many users had issues of battery drain also. But if I had purchased Redmi note 9 pro max, Poco X2 or even Motorola one fusion plus or Realme 6 I would have deeply missed my Lenovo P2s super amoled display…..All these chinese brand phones though have gud Snapdragon processors but have very poor IPS display which r no match to super amoled display. I have seen and compared few IPS display phones with family and friends with my Lenovo P2 super amoled display…..there is day and night difference….So if I had gone with Redmi note 9 pro max I would have missed super amoled display and sony sensor…in samsung m31s I will miss Snapdragon processor…btw my 3.5 yrs old Lenovo P2 is having Snapdragon 625….Its super power efficient and smooth for day today tasks and heavy multi tasking..never played any games though....hope Exynos processor will atleast match S625 if not more.I ordered it on 6th Aug around 12.15 am…. was delivered on 8th Aug…..first impression is very gud especially the camera… excellent super amoled display….even a lot better than my Lenovo P2 super amoled display….built quality is the best in M series with new stylish dual colours and also has a side frame….but can’t b compared to glass backs which r just awesome but very fragile in reality….. anyways how many of us use mobile without case…..so this shall not make any impact for potential buyers of M31S…......case is must for M31s coz back though looks like glass is plastic and will easily get scratches.Battery is also excellent....being a Lenovo P2 user for 3.5 yrs I think finally I got a gud successor for it. Can't really tell the battery screen on time coz I am installing my 100 plus apps and logging in. Today charged from 21% to 100% in 1.36 hrs....so from 0 to 100 it might take 1.55 hrs to max 2 hrs...huge important over M31 which had same battery but would take 2.45 hrs to fully charge.Fingerprint is gud….it's fast but u need to touch it correctly….but I am getting used to side mounted fingerprint…it will take some time as I had front (below the display) fingerprint in my Lenovo P2.Rear camera is excellent. I am still checking out its features. Intelli cam with single take is quite interesting and helpful during important private moments.Indoor selfies r excellent provided there is enough artificial light…. without much light it’s avg like any other mid range phone….if we use front flash (white screen) when lighting is less then photo come very sharp and gud but with little boosted colours like wat normally redmi and realme back cameras do….I am not a gamer…..for normal apps and multi tasking there is no delay at all….hope in long run it remains the same…I am still little doubtful abt Exynos processor after few months….but this processor is tried and tested by samsung in many phones so hoping for the best…

  Not happy with this phone, apps are getting closed automatically wifi and mobile data connectivity issues are also there will see two more days else place the replacement or refund request

  Wrost apps. This is built in favor of Amazon. My phone is getting much more heating. Even in cold weather like ac room during a call also. But this worst apps tested and certified ok.THINK MILLION TIMES BEFORE YOU PURCHASE A PHONE FROM AMAZON SITE.NOW I AM GOING TO FILE A COMPLAINT ON CONSUMER FORUM AS PER NEW GUIDELINES OF CONSUMER......

"
"

  There is too much problem in this phone.1.  6000Mah battery but phone doesn't work even half day on standby mode.2.  In 64MegaPixel camera quality is too bad as per expactation.3.  Not working properly any sensor in phone (Face & Fingerprint).4.  It's too much time taken to charge the full battery approx more than 6hrs.Please don't buy this worst phone.

"
"

  My phone is dead after 10 hrs. I'm wait technical visit..........

"
"

  Liked almost everything about the phone. Except video / movies in dark light where images become pixelated. One more thing is lag in apps such as Smule for instance...Edit 1: after 5 days usage- Without a proper back cover, it is very slippery- Due to the massive battery size, the phone is on the heavier side- Some Apps are not having the proper aspect ratio due to the new dimension of the phone- The screenshot option is very inconvenient as compared to my previous phone, Xiaomi Note 4, that one was so easy to use!- I shifted to this non-Chinese phone (of course when the chance came) & expected it to be better but Chinese phones are surely VFM!- The processor is a huge let down! Seems that the RAM is unable to cope up with the lack of processing speed in this phone- The Camera is good yet using the same will take some more time for a Samsung non-userSome more updates in Edit 2!!!

  Very nice phone. I am normal mobile user.. No games.. Just msgs and calls.Used it for couple of days.Below are the points.Pros1. Best display.2. Side finger scanner is fast.3. Good battery life.4. Very good camera for day and Night.5. Feels lightweight and grip is good in hand.CONS1. PLASTIC BODY.2. Quality of Charging cable is ordinary.3. Samsung should have included screen guard and body cover at this price.4. Not sure but internet gets disconnected frequently. Seems some sort of issue.

"
"

  good product under budget. Got it for 18K in Amazon sale.Phone is not heavy weight though it has big battery.Excellent display with L1 support.Super fast charger.Good camerasSide finger print sensor is very good.Stylish gradient design.Few things I personally didn't like:Build quality - seems very fragile.Too much of pre installed software by Samsung.No back cover included in the box.Phone looks very long (depends on personal choice).I am not a gamer.All in all best budget SUPER AMOLED mobile in this price range.

"
"

  Cons:Button position (power& volume) too highThough the battery capacity is high, battery drains fast.A lot of bloatware. Removed loads of stuff, tons still left.Width is less, height is more.The width is less than my MotoG5s+ and hence it disturbs viewing experience e.g. when viewing a YouTube video in a vertical manner.Pros:The fingerprint reader integrated to the power button is nice (touch to open, press down to lock)Does not feel too heavyNice display.The camera is decent.25W charger better than 15W of the M31

"
"

  Two issues detected :1. There is a considerable voice fluctuation in the RECEIVER of the device. While talking on call, the voice of person on another end fluctuates (decrease & increase frequently).2. The Single Take camera feature is not working properly. When I capture from Single Take, it only gives 3 videos but not the 7 photos along with that (which, it is not meant for).One could ignore the non working of camera feature once, but RECEIVER related issue can not be overlooked.When any new model is launched in the market, it is recommended to wait atleast 1-1.5 months from buying it, so that the detected bugs would be fixed by the company in the devices manufactured afterwards.I made a mistake, hope it helps others.

  Looks wise it rocks.Dispaly is amazing.. Touch is also smooth.. Totally First impression awesome ...But i got a defective piece... NO FLASH IN THE MOBILE I GOT... being big brand how samsung will do these mistakes..Horrible experience..

This is the most basic setting shockingly missing.My Vodafone 4G SIM works good in my other OPPO F3 mobile after setting network mode as 4G.If I didn't get solution either from  Amazon or Samsung, I will return this mobile.

  You got for what you paidPros:1. Excellent display & Camera2. Better sound output3. Battery4. Support for Widevine l1 (For streaming Full HD contents of Netflix,  Amazon Prime, etc)5. Glastic back6. Headphone JackCons:1. Lots of bloatware (Even if you choose to skip while setup, it will eventually install later on)2. No NFC3. Little heatup issues then and there4. No phone case or Screen guard provided5. Year old processor which may slowdown with updatesI haven't tried any games yet. So cannot comment on the processor's maximum capability.At 19k, this phone really worth for its Camera & Display

  this is worst experience m facing ryt nw, this device start getting  heat even after taking a call for 5 min., and also app doesn't operate properly device os hanging and legging can also be seen. This starts after 2 days and now amazon is saying thjs is normal heating issue and they are not giving me replacement or refund for this device..so guys take care of this before buy this device.

  I m not sure to call this a budget phone or a mid range phone. But worth the cost. Got it delivered as promised and seems to have good battery life. It's the 2nd day, I still have got 50% after watching few movies. If you have craze for the features and don't have money to buy a high end phone, then 31s is a better choice. The product is a little bulky than my MiA1. The display is just at it's best. Amoled. Phone doesn't seem to heat. But charging isn't in 97 mins as said. I find it to be around 110-120 mins just like normal phones. But the battery discharge is quite good. Found stock android to be a little flexible comparatively. But not to complaint. Overall it's one of the best phones I have ever had. Phone supports dual SIM + SD Card. Really Quality phone Made in India.

  Phone is not working as expected its very slow and even I am getting frequent  error ""System UI is not responding""I need to return this set and will purchase some other phone maker set but Amazon is not allowing me to do that and its seems very difficult  to contact Amazon  customer care in this COVID time.This is my worst experience  with any phone I have used till date.

  Honestly I rarely review on products. I expected a lot from Samsung Galaxy m series particularly from m31s. I purchased one m21 for my father, m31 for sister and m31s for my self on exchange of Oppo f9. I was very happy when I received m31s. But disappointed about the poor packaging. Still I manage my anxiety to taste the set. The handset is having absolute premium looks. Again the picture quality of captured photos disappointed me. Battery is unable to give feelings of 6000mah. Its like less than 4000mah. Network is comparatively weak. Followed the procedure for replacement. The technician asked to install Blancco app to run diagnostic. Then he asked me to go for battery calibration test which is a one day process. Again followed the process of replacement. The technician checked all things and at last told me that the replacement may not be possible for this m31s rather adviced me to go for refund process. The foolish technician rarely knew the process of exchange purchase. On my second attempt of replacement process I came to know that, the first technician registered my complain as the problem is in m21. How foolish. I have compared my m31s with another m31s purchased by my neighbor where I found my set as weaker one. IF REPLACEMENT DONE IN NEAR FUTURE BY AMAZON I WILL BE SATISFIED AND RATE IT AS 5STAR OTHERWISE I WILL WITHDRAW MY PRIME MEMBERSHIP AND CLOSE ALL RELATIONSHIPS WITH AMAZON.

  Awesome camera qualityPowerful batteryNice build qualityExynos 9611 is not bad, I mean trust me if you are a working person an average mobile user, you won't feel any issue with this processor.If you are looking for non Chinese brand, you can choose this phone blindly.If you compare with price this phone is much better than One Plus Nord. I am not even going to comparing this phone with cheap and disgusting Redmi, Oppo, Vivo etc. phones.

"

  All in all the mobile is very good. Especially the display is tremendous in this price segment,but there is an issue of heating on this mobile. Mobile gets hot after 10 minutes of use. I want to know from the Manufacturer that can it be fixed in software update!!??

"
"

  The first Best part is wifi calling. Now you don't have to run to your balcony to catch some signals if you have a wifi connection.Second best part is that it has a very beautiful tag line - Made In India!Battery is literally a monster. No matter how heavy user you are. It will long last atleast a full day. For me it is 1.5 days.Screen quality is better than my iphone 7. Thanks to SAMOLED.Camera quality is again better than iphone 7. Thanks to 4 cameras.Processor is mediocre. Nothing great to boast about it. With this respect iphone 7 was smoother.Android vs IOS... once again ios is lot better than android.Overall happy with Samsung M31s4.5 out of 5 stars

  I bought this cellphone as my backup phone, within 8 days of usage there is sudden pigmentation around bottom left of the screen. Amazon shows that replacement was valid only till 16th Aug, 10 days from date of order but not from delivery.Since its a newly launched model service center is saying that they dont have spares. I am helpless now.

  Firstly I am giving 1star because of its processor I think samsung must upgrade Exynos processor.... And after 2 days use the phone heat too much and battery drained very fastPros..1. Best camera and camera features specially singal take2. Best battery 6000 mah with reverse charging and 25 watt fast charging3. SAmoled Display one of the best display you can say ...Cons...1. Processor It's not so bad but you can say old one..2. I feel some network connectivity issu in my airtel3. Build quality- It is not bad but if the use glass body then it could be much better4. Overpriced 1.5k or 2k5. Heating issue6. Battery draining issue7. It take 3 hours to full charge

  This is just an amazing phone. The camera is really good, Samsung's OneUI is feature rich, but the display and battery are the real MVPs here. For such a huge battery, the phone doesn't feel that heavy, lighter than phones within this price range.But that's because they use glass, and Samsung uses a material which is basically plastic, and to be honest, I would pick plastic over glass anyday. Glass is glass and glass breaks. Besides there is no point in having a glass back if it doesn't have wireless charging as well right?Speaking about the camera, it is very similar to any mid-ranger, but the highlight I would say is Single Take. It is not only just fun to use, but is very helpful as well. I didn't expect to like it this much. It is amazing.Now the display, it's huge. And it's vibrant. It's just a pleasure to look at. Sure it may be 60Hz, but the sAMOLED panel is a cut above the rest.And the 6000mAh battery is coupled with a 25W fast charger, which charged the phone reasonably fast, about 80 minutes from 10% to 98%. This is definitely a two-day phone as I am a mid-weight user, primarily media consumption.The one glaring issue: THE PROCESSOR, and in extension the GPU. It is noticeably inferior to Snapdragon 720g, 730g and the 730 which you can find in phones of similar price range. The difference is not that apparent in daily usage, but I'm sure it will impact a lot if you scroll through media a lot, or if you game a lot. So if you're a gamer, I would suggest a Chinese OEM, they have better hardware for the price.In conclusion, if you are a media consumer who also uses the camera a lot, buy this phone without a doubt. If you are anything more - a gamer, a person who wants to future-proof their phone etc.. I would look elsewhere.I love this phone as this fits my usage perfectly.

  In one word the phone is awesome. U can go for it. I am writing this review after 3 months of usage.Pros:1. Battery life is awesome. It normally last more than a day in vast usage. I had got a maximum backup of 3 day with single charge at normal usage.2. 64 mp camera is just fantastic. Pictures are crisp and detailed. Even it will not haze with sufficient zoom. Night mode is much better then other phones.3. Look is also good with a punch hole camera. Samsung has maintained a premium look even after housing a 6000 mah battery. Phone looks slim.4. Display is much better even then premium Chinese smartphone. Super amoled as it is.5. Finger print sensor is much faster. Face lock is also very good.6. Speakers are loud and crisp. U will get clear, loud and detailed sound while calling and music/ videos playing.7. Gastric look also provide a premium look. (Even Glass back is desired as it becomes a standard now a days).8. Phone weight less with 6000 mah battery. It takes 1.5 hrs to completely charge. Thanks to 25 watts super fast charging from samsung.

  My issue:I purchased this mobile to play PubG or other games but play games on this mobile is now a dream because it's stucking during play and Amazon is not providing any return and replacement option while my return window is still open.Regarding Amazon service:This time amzon changed their policy, so only replacement option available, but you won't be able to replace it because if you are facing any issue then it's technical staff will not approve or accept it.Regarding Samsung:I tried samsun mobile device this time but this company haven't changed so far. They are showing super fast processor or ram but you won't be able to play any game like PubG or any other game, all games are stucking. I will not recommend samsung mobile, you can buy note 9 pro insted of these samsung mobiles.Conclusion before buying any product on Amazon please check they are providing return and replacement option, if they are providing only replacement option then Don't buy those products from Amazon because it's a trap.Don't waste your money on Amazon because they have proven that we should not buy any product online. Because after purchasing if you are facing any issue afterwords their support team will not help you to return it.Thia is just my review and chalanges that I'm facing with AmazonGod bless you guys.

  Don't go for this product. It's not upto the mark as mentioned in product description. Camera quality is not at all good and face unlock is very slow.  Also the phone refreshing rate is very slow.Also the Amazon team is not helping me with returning the product when i am trying to return this within 24hrs of delivery.Worst camera from SamsungWorst support from Amazon team

"

  Lots and lots of heating problem is there in the upper part of the phone while calling or browsing. Because of this issue you can't  call without earphones. Camera is also not that good as mentioned. Battery is also draining too fast .

"

  Phone was delivered without a sim ejector pin and outer case .There was no plastic packaging outside the box only a seal was present.

  I haven't words for M31S,  GREAT, I didn't like Chinese items.Thanks

"

  I bought this phone only the reason it have a best camera. But after 5 days use i am not satisfied with this phone. Reasons:-1. Camera:  It's not up to the mark. In low light photo is very bad.photo looks blur. In night also camera not good. Only v can take good photo in evening. That time all phones give us better photos.No AI support in camera. And portrait mode is in not in one click, its also not perfect. Macro also not good.2. Battery: The 6000 battery feels like 4500mah battery. One day we can use.3. Processer: now I don't feel any lag,but all youtube videos we can see this processor is not good enough for this phone.4. There is no second space option, No IR remote and gallery doest have discover,album options like iphone and honor phone.5. No screen recording option and no network speed showing option.Pros:1. In single shot we can get many videos and photos.2. Great display & design3. Smooth touch & fast fingerprint sensor.

  I have used various mobiles but Samsung is really a price saver and satusfier product Samsung m31 s is a best mobile I am reviewing features1. Camera quality awesome Sony made2. Screen is fully hd3.gamers are invited to purchase this awesome processor for games like pubg4. Reverse charging really amazed me5.battery backup is highIt has only one disadvantage it contains plastic body that I do not like on this and finally I reached to conclusion mobile is really awesome 😊😊

"
"

  bought it on amazon prime day sale . phone looks are very premium. amoled display is amazing . the single take option in photos work perfectly and allows you to take multiple shots in one go. phone battery is also good and works for one and half day without charge on moderate use. overall premium phone at decent price.

  Samsung galaxy m31s is most anticipated mobile ever because of its unique mixture of A and M series mobile features. It's the 1st mobile in M series to provide many flagship features like single take, 25w fast charging, infinity O display and even  it is secured by knox.Pros:1.Big battery and it's quite good with 1 and half day use. A light user definately gets 2 complete.days.2. Camera is also pretty good with more flagship features bundled in it.3. Display is an advantage in any samsung mobile. It does pretty well and looking very much premium.4. Loud speaker. Samsung doesn't teased about it but sound quality is really satisfying.5. Knox security is available but may be with limited functions. I haven't seen secured folder or nfc which are still differentiating it with A series mobile.6. Experience is good. I'm not a gamer, so overall i haven't noticed any issues with UI, software or processor.7. Looks are really premium. Metallic finishing gave stunning look to the mobile but note that it comes with plastic body only.Cons:1. Although the charger is of 25W charger, it's taking 2hours to charge completely.. may be because of monster 6000mah battery.2. Side mounted fingerprint scanner. It's a con since i haven't used it before and it's bit difficult to use.3. Phone is slightly heavy but that's because of battery but weight balance is good.Finally, if you are a heavy user but not with heavy games and looking for a clean android experience other than MIUI , colour os etc which will have adware in the apps, this mobile is a perfect purchase for you.

"

  I appreciate the camera quality of M31s.. the selfie camera has a quality as your rear camera and the night shots or shots in dark are much better. The rear camera has a nice focus though not able to take clear long distance shots (100mts) which are very far but shots within 20-30 meters are perfect.I was impressed by the performance and charging as well. I have a 6GB Ram as i'm not a gamer hence could not comment but else good battery life.

  Here's an honest review after a week's usage. Please take the time to read the pros and cons of this device. I'll start with the pros first.Pros:• The Samsung display never disappoints, very good colors.• The device is pretty smooth to use, there's no lag whilst browsing and using multiple apps in the background.• Sound output is decent for this price range.Cons :• The battery life, its supposed to last atleast a day and a half with this 6k mah battery, but i get only 10 hours of battery life with a normal usage such as WhatsApp, YouTube, music and browsing.• Finger print scanner is not upto the mark, since it's narrow and thin button, it doesn't recognise the print sometimes. I have thick fingers and maybe its because of that.• Face unlock is pathetic, I sometimes think that it's scanning someone else's face at times. Most of the time it never recognises my face eventhough I've registered my face in a bright environment. During low light, forget about it.• Notifications bug, when I play a WhatsApp audio or voice note, it constantly notifies me which is annoying. And whilst riding and listening to music, if there's a notification in the BG, after every song it notifies me which is annoying eventhough I turned off notification reminder.• Camera quality is decent but not great like how they've advertised. Some low light shots are grainy and only in bright environments it can capture some good pics.• No screen recording and no notification lights, although this can downloaded from the play store, there's an app for it. But the whole point is this is an android phone and its the basic feature, my previous cheap Chinese Huawei phone had more features.Anyway, overall I wouldn't recommend this if you're just looking for the battery life because it'll disappoint you. I'm quite disappointed with this phone and I doubt if I'd go for Samsung again. Thanks for reading, good day.

  #Processor is the main drawback#Camera is super awesome in day light but struggles in low light conditions.# Finger print sensor accuracy is 60%## Phone is overpriced if we compare with other brands..## 9611 Exynos is a junk and my Redmi note 5 pro is performaning better than the 9611 chipset!#Screen is a treat for eyes undoubtedly.Charges in 97min. from 0-100% in switch off mode.Doesn't overheat at all.Sound is above average..Voice quality is good.Signal reception is goodAll should be neglected but aged and lagging processor is a thumbs down!!

  Return boy not received this mobile he told me it not work but I'm already complete it not working

"
"

  The screen of the phone was broken when we received it. On calling the customer service, they can't replace the product since it's out of stock so we filed for a refund. The pickup agent denied picking up the product saying he needs a confirmation email first. When we called the customer support we were told that the pickup guy reported that the imei was mismatched which is why he didn't pickup but in reality he didn't even check imei. Since then we filed for a pickup 4 times and nobody has shown up to pick it up. Pathetic behaviour by the Bhopal logistics team. The Amazon support talks very politely to us and assure us of pickup but then do nothing about it.

  Worst mobile ever phone is heating too much I complain to the Amazon but they are not expecting my complain

"
"

  A worst phone and worthless.Camera quality is poorTakes blurry shotsThere is no easy way to click slefies as phone length is more its hard to reach buttons. The palm sensor takes blurred selfies and delay in loading pictures.Any Chinese phone of 10k is much better than thisPerformance is not upto the mark as they claim. Fingerprint sensor takes time to unlock the phone. Hardly recognizes the face. Phone is not quick on opening app or anything.Width of the phone is less compare to other 6.5 inch phonesIts an absolute waste of money.This phone is worth of 8k and I have wasted my money in this worthless due to its hyped advertisement  and just to get rid of Chinese products

"
"

  1) excess Heating while charging, using camera, using for more than 2 Minutes.2) Camera is really good, loved AR3) Charger really charge it fast but battery, whatever mentioned as 6000 Mah, doesnt really upto the mark.4) some time FaceID doesnt work, FaceID is slow.5) Touch quality is not good.6) Side mounted Fingerprint reader doesnt give expected result.7) overall disappointed with this. wont opt for samsung in future.

  Bad product... Don't buy ... Hold your money and go with other devices

  Another excellent M series mobile from Samsung.  Look of the mobile is elegant. The Amoled screen is very much vibrant and better than the previously launched M30s . Also i felt that the screen size is slightly 2 mm larger than M30s. The front camera is placed slightly 2mm lower than the top edge, henceforth may hinder video viewing in the enlarged screen mode. The battery is a monster with 6000 mAh , so need not worry about charging for atleast 2 days with respect to the way I use. Also thanks to reverse charging facility that samsung introduced in this model. Any gadget that has c-port can be charged directly with the charging cable provided as the both ends of the charging cable are of c- port. I think this feature is only introduced by Samsung in the budget range of less than 20k . However for connecting to the laptop I may have to use the M30s charge cable.  Also there is no heating problem during charging. Also the charging time is approx one and half hour from zero to full charge, which i believe is decent for a battery with capacity of about 6000 mAh.The sound quality is great. The camera quality - primary 64MP and front - 32 MP are awesome. There is a flash available for front cam as well similar to retina flash on iPhone 7 plus. Depth ( similar to portrait mode in iPhone) and Macro modes ( useful for capturing smaller size objects) are decent though not excellent. I am yet to check wide angle mode of camera. Also I am yet to check the night mode shots. Also there are other special features like single click are easy to use . It will capture a bunch of photos and video from which the best and required ones can be chosen and rest can be deleted. There are other features like single video recording on front and back cam , smart selfie option which I am yet to explore and review the quality as I just received the mobile . Also I liked the concept of introduction of finger print on the power  button on the right side. The specification of processor, RAM and storage space are decent for the price paid. Also i believe that samsung is offering the mobiles at the decent spec at lesser price when compared to other premium brands like one plus, MI etc.,. Also thanks to Amazon for delivering the mobile within 5 days, i.e., a week earlier than the promised date as I see that the mobile is not available at the time of order placement, because of the demand. Earlier I bought 2 qty of M30s and I had a very good experience of using them as i never experienced any performance issues with them. Also the M series mobiles are quite sturdy. Now I believe that I will have a much better experience with M31s. Thanks to samsung for the continual launch of better quality mobiles at a very competitive price. Also the samsung galaxy eco system of apps and cloud are pretty decent . Also I have a good experience with the services of samsung incase of any damage to the mobile. Overall I am happy with the product and also with the services of samsung and Amazon.

  Facial recognition is not working itself and Its says 64MB camera but its only in writings not in performance.6000 MAH battery but it will drain in 8hrs (Not even Continues) if you watch basic youtube and normal FB browsing. I will not recommend this mobile if anyone wish to by only for Camera and battery

  My first ever Samsung phone...Feels like a premium phone when you hold it in your hand.Display is awesome. It is very bright even in outdoors.Weight of the phone is little bit more. But it didn't feel heavy, because Samsung has done its weight balance in pretty good manner.Processor is good, didn't feel any lag till now.Fingerprint scanner is a little bit slow. Sometimes it needs to press hard to scan.Camera quality is also good especially in daylight. But typical Super slow motion video(which I like most) is of limited duration.Battery last for 24-30 hrs for normal use (battery optimization could be better). The battery life can be improved by changing power mode in the setting.The 25W charger is also very good. And it is ""Made in India"".Samsung UI is also good.Samsung should have provided at least a case with this 20k phone. It is hard to find case in the market for a newly launched phone.Overall worth for the money. 4.5/5 star.Better than the Chinese phones.Do buy the Samsung phones instead of the cheap Chinese phones.

  This device is supposed to charge from 0 to 100% in 97 minutes.However, the product I received takes 3 hours to charge fully.How could this be 25 W superfast charging?! Hope no one else is facing this issue.Need to replace my device!

  Yesterday I received new M31s phone. It is very bad phone with bad quality features, both camera are too bad picture quality and no flash on front camera.Till now found cameras are look like VGA picture camera. I tried to return this phone but Amazon care denied and said no return, replace and refund policy on phone.

  Faulty mobile phone received. To charge this phone, it takes around three hours to charge upto 65%, while operating the phone, charging indicator showing @5%.Spoke to amazon customer service about this issue.

  I purchased this phone on 6th August, but still I can't use the phone. Only because tempered glass and back cover is not available. Come on samsung, I purchased because I didn't want to purchase oppo,pocco.. blah blah.... As I am supporting make in India product.. but these Chinese brand know the nerve of customer and providing basic accessories with the phone.. it would be better if i ordered Mi phones, they are providing basic accessories and the camera quality is better than your phone in this price range..

  So here you'll get my honest opinion about samsung M31s👇I just got this phone.I ordered this phone on first launch day from amazon.Question 1:- What do i think about this phone in this range?Answer:- This phone in this range is quite good but if you're a samsung lover or you boycott chinese product and don't want to buy a chinese phone like mi,realme.You can go for it.Question2:- What do you think about specifications in this range?Answer:- Specification what i like most is Display quality,good battery backup,fast charging,good camera and process is still being tested so keep in touch on telegram @guptajitalks .Question 3 :- Should i purchase this phone in this range?Answer:- Umm i'll suggest you to go for it if you're a samsung lover and your priority is batter backup,fast charging,video watching,camera then please go for it but if in the past you've used realme,or mi phone then don't purchase it because you'll miss some of their feature which is not available in this phone you need to install extra applications for them from play store or other source.Question 4:- Should i purchase Samsung M31 or M31s??Answer:- If your main priority is fast charging and you want to use a new updated fingure print sensor you can go for it otherwise everything is similar in this phone.Choose according to your budget.Question5 :- Does fingure print work fine?Answer:- Fingure print senson is working awesome.I was also getting hesitate but now i am feeling relax because it's working fine and smooth.Question 6 :- Anything else if you want to ask then text me on telegram @guptajitalksAnswer:- Will be updated soon😊I want to mention something:-👇👇👇Note:- 1.Camera,charging,display,cable,Video watching experience is awesome.Processor is still being tested.2.You'll miss some feature if you previously used mi or realme phone.You need to install extra app for it.

  After using 10 days:1. It's not look like 6000mah battery. Other brands phone in below 5000mah, can give more backup than this.2. Very bad wifi receiver. Not able to capture wifi signal properly. Same thing for reverse case means mobile hotspot. It's not able to transmit high range. Trust me if you think I am wrong, just make a comparison with you any old phone and see the difference.3. If both sim card are on, in 2nd sim you are getting call, after disconnecting call sometimes network is fluctuating. It's taking some time to stable.4. If you are dropping your phone to bed, some sound is coming. It seems sim tray is casing this noise.5. Lock or Finger print scanning button which is mounted in right side is making sound (tik tik) while pressing it. It's not smooth.Please check your phone and don't forget to add comments here wheather you are facing or not the same. I am waiting for all your inputs.

  Very disappointed with Samsung and Amazon...Camera hangs and single shot mode doesn't works properly...Sometimes it gives only three outputs and sometimes 7...It never gives 10 outputs as claimed by brand...

"
"

  Not happy with amazon service. Guys it is 20K+ Rs cellphone..the back cover is not fitted properly and it could damage display..In spite of having replacement policy amazon failed to provide replacement and providing refund..this is going to be painful experienceas I have exchanged my reliable Nokia as it was having less tech spec and I purchased this cellphone on EMI..this made situation slightlycomplicated. I am thinking to file a case against Amazon in consumer court..Samsung plz take care of your product quality..not expected from giant like you who is a big game changer and invest lot of money in R&D. Poor quality control and pre dispatch  inspection.I'd never buy Samsung  again.

"
"

  Lets talk about the positives first:Design & Build - Compelling for this Price range. Fingerprint Magnet - AlertDisplay - Damn, This is the best.Software Experience - This is not a clean UI but I like this feature that Samsung almost took customization to the next level.Camera - Decent, Sony sensors does its job and Samsung's camera features is like a cherry on top.Multimedia Experience - This is what the phone is good at. Believe me it wont disappoint you either.Battery - Humongous. and Fast Charger is in the box. No need to worry about the battery backup.Cons:-Not major but noticeable.Weight :- You ll definitely feel it when used for a long period of time.Performance - This is not so good as the competition provides for this price range. You can notice it heavily while scrolling Twitter.  But everything is usable. Just a little bit of boost to the performance would have taken this phone to the next level.Phone gets little bit warm which is also noticeable. ( I don't know if only I have that issue)Overall - (Gamer boy, Performance Addict) - Just Ignore thisPeople like me those who could sacrifice that little performance for a good multimedia experience should definitely give it a try. And that display, you ll definitely fall in love with it.

  Phone which I received is getting warmer around the ear piece area even for short duration calls (less than 2 min) when I made a compliant to Amazon and Samsung they say it's completely normal.My question is how can a earpiece gets warmer even for a short duration calls then how could I take calls comfortably.Better to stay away from this device until we have the complete review or fix for this product.

  After the setup process I have noticed the volume was very very low for some time and it came after some time.After used for two days same problem stared again for some time.Is the mobile need repair or replacement.

"

  Purchased it on sale day, received in 2 days. 5* for Amazon delivery & service. Samsung M31s 8GB 128GB is the best to buy product in around 20k with 6000mah battery & amoled display. Camera is far better than M31 as it used Sony sensor. Works like charm with no lag, beautiful display, good camera, easy too handle, not much of bloatware & many can be disabled/uninstalled of not needed. Overall a good to buy product. 1* less rated due to dual core back cover design, which is not of ok & not much impressive. Otherwise all good. Go for it.

  Best Super Amoled display ,very smooth experience  ,Brilliant  Quad Cmera,Amazing  battery life thanks to huge 6000mah Battery , Fingerprint sensor is very fast and accurate and also  i like the position of sensor,phone supports hdr ,easy to hold ,feel premium,little bit heavier than my old phone (who has 5000mah battery)i suggest you to apply case otherwise you can see some scratches on backoverall phone is excellent

  Please don't purchase this phone via Amazon. These phones not pass by Samsung quality Department. So Iam sharing my experience.

  This is best phone under 20k range and also easily beats many phones under 30k as well.Pros:1. Samsung  brand value2. sAmoled screen, best display, amazin color reproduction, supports Always on Display3. Best in class camera with sony imx 682 sensor, better than many other high range phones as well.4. Single take camera feature works superb5. Amazing low light photography6. 25W superfast samsung charger in this price range and monster battery 6000 mah which easily works of minimum 1.5 to 2 days7. Knox security8. Cool body finishing9. Side mounted finger print sensor, better than back and indisplay finger print sensor10. Small punch hole display in front for camera which makes screen even better. Thats great as compared to pill shaped 2 camera or U camera.11. Sapphire camera glass. Checked this in one of the m31s durability test. It does not get scratched even with level 7 scratches.12. Thanks to samsung for not skipping 3.5mm camera jack13. Dolby audio in headphonesand bluetooth speaker14. Loud loudspeakerCons:Nothing as suchOnly better processor would have been cherry on cake. But i am not a gamer and this processor handles day to day usage easily without any lags or slowness.Overall amazing phone without any limitation in budget and mid range.Will upload phone and camera samples soon.

  Worst product ever,I got this phone on 15aug 2020 and after that I found it camera was not working properly, I couldn't make videos because its not working while watching videos sound is not properly even i can't heard anythingVery disappointing phone i would rather go for one plus nord

"
"

  I liked the camera on M31s and I think it's the best camera on a phone under 20k. Apart from that samsung is making Chinese manufacturers sweat by slowly focusing on mid range mobile category so yeah we can expect great phones under low budget as well.  Only thing which I don't liked about this device is Exynos 9611 as it is an old processor & shows its age while gaming. Apart from that everything is ""monster"" 😁.

"
"

  Phone functions are good but charging is slow not like as fast as advertised..  It took almost  one and half hour to reach out 75% from 20% like other handsets.. I don't find any speciality in fast charging or charger.

  Is this the best smartphone under 20,000/-Let's find outBattery:-This is the only reason why I bought this phone. So, I thought I will share my experience regarding the battery life of this phone first.I really use my phone.  I receive over a hundred phone calls per day and hundreds of WhatsApp message if not thousands. When I reach my phone I have an average of 50% juice left in the battery. So to say, I am pretty happy with the battery life on this phone.Camera:-This is another one of the main selling point on this phone.  This phone has quad camera setup at the back and an single punch hole display in the frontList of cameras at the back:-1. Primary camera - 64MP - Sony IMX6822. Ultra wide lens - 12MP - 123° field of view3. Macro lens - 5MP4. Live focus lens - 5MPPrimary camera takes beautiful crisp shots with excellent dynamic range provided ample amount of light. If doesn't disappoint me in night also! The ultra wide camera provides the same amount of color balance and dynamic range. The live focus provides good edge detection. So this is the most improved phone in the 'M' lineup of Samsung phones.Display:-This has a beautiful display with a dot nucth which doesn't interfere much. Therefore this has a good display tooFingerprint sensor:-This phone has a side mounted fingerprint sensor. The placement of the fingerprint sensor is excellent and I quite like it compares with my previous phones which has fingerprint sensor at the back, but one thing which disappoint me is that it won't work when you r hands have even the slightest amount of water or oil or any other thing.Conclusion:-This is not a perfect phone under 20,000/- but it is definitely one of the better phones for 20,000/-.

  A perfect phone made by Samsung in mid range. Camera perfect, Body style perfect, Battery perfect  & much more. But a thing I don't understand that why Samsung made charger cable C to C, it would better if it comes with USB to C which helps us to connect it easily with many devices like powe bank,  Desktop and etc.And one more thing I like to suggest to Samsung that, it will be more better if Samsung gives a back cover with every smartphone because in market back covers are available after 3-4 weeks of phone launch & all of us know that it is how risky to use a smartphone without cover.

  Camera quality is great. SonyIMX sensor rocks. Night mode is awesome. Screen Display quality is a treat for eyes, brilliant sAMOLED. Battery is Monster.Only one issue of data transfer from laptop due to lack of USB cable. Mobile shipped with Type C to Type C cable for charger/reverse charger. Samsung should add flexible back cover and USB to C port cable in the box.Ad free UI. Simple and useful. And most important it is made in India. GO for it. Good choice over cheap unsafe Chinese items.

  Awesome loaded by samsungI have upgraded from m30sDisplay was new feel with punch hole.Fingerprint and face unlock was faster.Felt good at camera aspect with stunning picture outcomeOnly disappointment is plastic backApart that everything was good and for a heavy user just blindly go with m31s

"
"

  You do not have to check any of the specification just buy blindly, only think on it before buying if you  are a heavy GAMER because this phone is not for gaming purpose it is pure BUSINESS phone.

  The mobile was delivered on Aug 12, much before it was showing earlier. I was using MiMax2, a Chinese product and was happy to use that and had decided to patronise Mi in future. But with current concept of avoiding Chinese products altogether, I ordered Samsung M31s. Initially, it looked to be smaller that Mi max2, though both having 6.5 display. But later on realised that M31s is a bit longer that Mi max2 thus both the phones have the same square cm area!The mobile is fantastic in everything. The finger sensor at the power key on the side is comfortable, so is the face recognition; I am enjoying it. I have set all three, pattern, finger sensor and face recognition for opening it. I could easily install dual WhatsApp. Two sims with external memory card is appreciable, with Volte in both sims always on. Camera should be good; I do not use it much.I could not find a system of locking/unlocking individual app through finger sensor, as I was having in mi max2, nor a shortcut for using torch when in haste. Yet happy for discarding a Chinese mobile and substituting with a good one, Samsung M31s. Go for it.

  Well this is my Jump from Galaxy J7 prime(2016) to this one.  It makes a big difference overall.But don't expect everything to be Premium, honestly speaking1. Camera is not like how it was hyped. It is decent and I was not expecting much from Samsung.2. Display is wonderful you will enjoy High end videos.3. Sound output is good.4. Battery I would like to say it took me exactly 1 hours 44 mins to charge from 0 to 100%. On the other hand it went from 100 to 96% In 23 mins while playing You tube music on Speaker it was connected through Wi-fi, no SIM connection and No any apps in background.5. Processor is fast. It can handle many apps at a time.Rest it is a wonderful fone and I don't have any complaints as you don't have any other non chinese fone is this price bracket.

  Amazing phone in this price range.Camera and battery life is really good.Fast charging works well.PUBG runs smoothly, faced the framedrops sometimes .. but still satisfactory game play. (Not good for heavy gaming )Fingerprint reader aworks well, not too fast not too slow. Face unlock is not good.Screen and build quality is amazing, looks are better than the competition.

  I'm a dentist and, I was searching for a phone in my budget; as well as, a phone with the best of specifications. I saw this beauty put up on the Amazon sale. And I believe it was one of my best decisions to buy it. The delivery was fast within a week and whole care of social distancing was taken by the Amazon Person.Coming to the model and the piece. •The Marble Blue colour is fabulous and the finishing is top class.•The camera quality is top-level, and the wide angle view makes photos look marvelous.•The night view gives the best of the image qualities even in absolute absence of light.•The best specification is the Macro Mode, which gives superb detailing, helping me get the best Intra-Oral pictures of my patients.•The side mounted fingerprint sensor is lightening quick, helps me open my phone in a jiffy.•The 6000mAh battery lasts the whole day, and still I haven't seen my battery bar going below 50%.•The 25W Ultra-Fast Charging saves my time in emergency situations.•The processor is so good & the phone works so smoothly, having 3-4 applications open at the same time is no more an issue.•The sound quality is so great (With Dolby Sound)*Pros:*•Best Camera Quality in this price range of mobiles.•A whole spectrum of specifications altogether.•Great Finishing, with a Great Look•Smooth Processing•Light Weighted, you don't even feel the phone in your hands.•The all new Side Mounted Fingerprint Sensor.*Cons:*The ones who are looking phones in 14-15K might find this one out of buget, but still by adjusting one should go for it, its definitely worthy.

  I bought it in on 6th August first sale. It an excellent mobile under this price.Processer is the old one but it works nicely  no problem at all doing daily activities.I am very much satisfied with it overall performances in all department like camera, battery,display, looks even processer.Thank you samsung for A nice phone in under 20000.

  Ordered M31S on 22nd Aug 2020 and got delivered on 27th Aug . Writing this review  after 4 days of usage.1.Look and feel  of M31S is premium.2.Monster batter for 1.5 days of normal use.3.Night mode is awesome4.Camera is great.5.UI of 31S is good.6.Host of  features in samsung M31S which i saw on youtube for tips and  tricks.7.If you are looking for phone under 20K, its the best non chinese phone in the market.8.Sound Quality of M31S is loud and clear.It is supported by Dolby Atmos.9.Processor is though old but OK for normal use.10.If you have tight budget under 20K....better go for M31S rather than Chinese brands currently availble in the market.

"
"

  Having bought it 1 minute into the sale I'd have to say.... No regrets! Its really great at this price point! The battery is amazing, even though I understand 6000mah is large I've not charged my phone in 2 whole days and still going at 50%; the ultra wide is better than I expected and the phone is light! No idea what phone these youtubers  were using but it fits well in my hand and is not heavy! I normally abhor exynos but I will say this is a tried and tested processor with no lag at all when I'm using the phone but noticeably not that snappy at pubg but not the end of the world! I'd very easily recommend this phone to friends and family. A+

  A great mobile with some cons for 18K price tag(1.5k discount)Pros:Sleek design. Not that heavy in hands.Massive battery life. Almost two full days.Good call qualityExcellent fast charger. Charging 6000mah in 90 minutes is amazing.Cons:Awful unboxing experience. Felt like unboxing a 5000rs phone.No soft case. Very badNo Samsung pay even after paying nearly 20K.Though OneUI is sleek it feels too heavy. Lot of junk ware some of which can be removed but why we need in first place. Why does galaxy store even exists. It started installing some idiotic apps as soon as I opened. Had to remove all the permission to galaxy store to stop it. Major negative.Camera need some software fix. Focusing issues are there.Power button is filmsy

  This is to share my horrible experience with Amazon and Samsung. The phone arrived with an irresponsive touch screen and I had to make multiple calls, emails to team to get it replaced. Even showed it to the Samsung customer care center.  After the technician report confirming that the phone is a defect piece, the only option available was to place it for a refund as it is no longer in stock.

"
"

  I ordered this Samsung galaxy m 31s model.but the charger was missing and camera quality is so cheap..very bad experience.i want to return the product.but they said only replacement of same phone can be done..plz gv me some option to return this item or I can replace with other good phone atleast having good camera quality.my phone screen was damaged.but phone charging is fast and good battery 🔋 backup..

"
"

  On first day.itself.  ..Phone is not getting charged after long hours of charging...And that too from Amazon and Samsung brandReplacement process initiated...But its very very bad experience and not expected from such reputed brandsNow who is responsible for this delay and at what cost band why we should sufferThird class quality control from Amazon and SamsungHope they karna lesson from this...Even though they might have millions of customer's..But bad lesson. ..Remains bad for ever

Deliverywas fast it came earlier  2 days. I'm  happy .also the charger has a feature  reversecharging  so if u want to transfer anything we need to buy separate  cable .I won't  play PUBG so I don't know for gamers but for normal games it runs smoothly. I'm  very Disappointed because they don't  provide any case so if u buy also add temperglass and case it's  my personal request so that u can enjoy ur mobile from the  first day onwards..Samsung team we r buying  mobile for 20000 y can't u afford headphone and case for customer.

  This is my worst experience with amazon that too over samsung.I got the mobile delivered on 20th Aug.Packaging was good.I opened the box overall style is good in view.But when i switched on the phone,it directly opens up in safe mode after restarting also it was in that mode only.Again down volume key button was not working at all.Then I find the phone detecting sim without sim card only.The phone was generating more heat as compared .I called to amazon tech support ,I followed all the instruction according to them still there is no change.I requested for replacement where I saw in my page phone is in stock but they denied for replacement and just the option was refund.

  Got it for 15.4 with exchange and fully satisfied  with product.Positive points1. Display2. Battery3. Camera4. overall software experience which is near to stock Android and lots of customizationNegative Points1. Weight-  Beacaus of huge battery,  the phone feel heavy and trust me u should use it with case.2.  Back of phone is fingerprints  magnet and every time u touch it gets worst.3. Polycarbonate body looks good but compromises on reliability.Overall pgone is worth to buy and color options are great. Good for daily task. NOT FOR GAMERS  !

  I booked the phone on 6th Aug on Amazon Sale but it got delivered to me on 13th Aug..It was first time that as prime member the delivery was so delayed!Coming to the Phone now...Just one word ""MASTERPIECE"" from Samsung.Truely it gives you feels as if you have hold a S series flagship phone.However,there is heating issue on the back as well as front...NO CASE COVER! NO SCREEN GUARD!!!CMON SAMSUNG HOW MUCH IT WILL COST YOU 50rs???

  Good product.Made in India initiative. Fingerprint scanner is very fast.Camera quality is superb.It can take good photos even at night.Optimised exynos 9611 processor deal with a good speed.Battery is the major highlight of this product. It comes with 25 watt fast charger which completely charge it in approx. 80 mnts.I am giving this review after 20 days use. It is a value for money product.Its diary is amazing Also,it is made in India 🇮🇳. Much better than #REDMI NOTE 9 PRO MAX,#REALME 7 PRO#,POCO X2

  1. Battery drains quickly not like Samsung Galaxy M31s2. Overheating, due to this your apps in multi window will close3. Audio jack issue, if headphones are touched or moved the Music Player will open and Call gets disconnected.4. Many reviewers said that macro mode is good, but it is not like that. One must use this personally then can  review.

"
"

  It's been 3 days since I am using this phone.And it has been a premium experience since. I am not a gamer hence it's performance is great for normal use. As for a gamer the processor might fall short.Major pros:Stylish finishPremium screen experienceSuperb cameraMajestic battery (charged once in three days)To sum it up, it is a great catch for a normal user with premium features.

"
"

  Cons.1.When you zoom the clicked pic it gets distorted overall nice camera.2.Processor should be upgraded.3.On screen fingerprint should be given than the side.4. Slight width should be increased5. At least a case should be given for the protection of the phone.6. Not much difference between M31 & M31s.Pros.1.Samsung screen is always a good and indeed a infinity experiences.2.UI/UX is good on this one overall a stock Android experience no bloatware or extra + lastest Android version 10.3.Camera is 8.8/10 (from my view).4.Massive battery 6000mah + 25W fast charger5. Great storage6. Good brand not Chinese.

"

  Even intagram is not working. Don't buy this phone. seriously waste of money. No smoothness, slow booting, UI is not user friendly. Hectic mobile.

"
"

  Phone is pretty much cool but bit heavy .I prefer if it will be more slim and light .The display is good and the camera is superb .Everything is good for me .Most impressive feature is super fast charging and most disappointing is that the battery is draining very fast and I have used it for only 5 days now .Very much disappointed with the overall battery 🔋 performance .It is no where in performance near to Redmi Phones ,Realme or One plus .I am now thinking that I have wasted my money coz it is not worthy for its rate ..What is surprising that there have been no original invoice in the package and its shocking to notice that .

"
"

  I got product today only.  Detailed review I will give later.Initial review under:Product is looking better than I expected.  Outer box is very cheap quality.  Screen resolution good but not best.  Camera quality good.  Soud quality motr than average.  It is taken more than 1 hour for 60% charging. Initially I feel it's a good phone but they could have atleast given back cover and ear phone with this price range.

"

  I was looking for a new phone in the Samsung brand I must say galaxy M31s is the best choice, that too at such a reasonable price.I have been using this phone for over a week now and following are my  views on the phone.1. Delivery by Amazon just the next day of my purchase. Thanks Amazon!2. The size of the phone is quite appropriate,it stays in my pocket easily and can be used single handed. It has a metal like finish3. As far as the display is concerned, crisp and clear with infinity- O display, absolutely soothing to the eyes.4. Sound quality - It has a premium quality Dolby sound and I just love to hear music on this phone.5. The 1st best feature if this phone is it's battery with 6000 mAh. Even if I don't charge my battery lasts for at least 2 days. Also the charger is very fast.6. The 2nd best feature is the camera. It has 4 cameras having best depth and clarity of 64mp with ultra wide lens and macro camera. The clarity of the front camera is outstanding for selfies!I would strongly recommend this phone, you can't get anything better in this range..

"
"

  Very nice and handy phone. Excellent camera, with very useful Single Take feature.Look of the phone is premium with the shaded back cover giving it a premium feel.Battery is good @ 6000mAh, enough to last a full day easilyScreen resolution is the best feature of Samsung phone, and this one also doesn't disappoint.Overall a very good buy at this price... Highly recommended

  For the first time when I turned the device on out of the box, the device was named as Kamal's Galaxy M31s. Now I dont know who that kamal is!!  Can any one tell me why it is named as Kamals and who that kamal is?  Themes also show as "" Themes recommended for kamal"".  This makes me feel like the device has been used by somebody else before and then remanufactured it and sent it to me.Device manufacturing is of very poor quality (not the mobile phone).  Looking at the box and its packaging, it does not look premium quality.  In fact, the package feels very cheap.  There was no back cover and screen guard provided at all in the box.  This definitely feels like it is manufactured by some local people not by the company like Samsung.  M series being specifically manufactured for India.  This shows how cheap the company sees at the Indians to give this kind of worst packaging and quality.  You can even check the printing on the sticker attached at the back of the mobile with imei numbers.  How cheap quality printing it was. (Check out the images. I even attached photos of my redmi box and u will make out the difference).Mobile phone definitely hangs sometimes.  I faced hanging issue while closing telegram app.  I also faced abrupt closure of apps in the middle on its own while installing all the necessary apps in the mobile.Camera wise, rear camera is good, but front camera is not up to the mark.  In low light conditions there is definitely a lot of noise in the photos taken with front camera.Display wise, it is Excellent being a superamoled display. However, they should have given 90Hz refresh rate for the price of mobile.I am not a gaming person so I dont know about gaming performance in this phone.I had high expectations  on this phone and purchased it with a huge excitement and enthusiasm, but this mobile does not meet the expectations and it disappointed me a little bit.I am somewhat a lover of samsung products especially display related products like mobiles and TV.  But, this time I am little disappointed with cheap manufacturing of the product.  Then again, display quality is very good. Other than that, rest of the things really disappointed me in this phone.

"

  Display is best in this segment. Its bright punchier colorsand great outdoor visibility. Deep blacks is perfect for movies. Sometimes i Miss high refresh rate screens but its ok to have such beautiful Amoled display.Camera is better now. Single take mode is fun to use. Night mode is now better than M31 and the best part is pro mode is back with shutter speed control. 4k front video is useful for bloggers like us. Selfie is good. The only thing i missed is telephoto camera. Syper steady is amazing.The exynos 7611 handles the phone quite well. But samsung should upgrade this to snapdragon or better processor made by samsung. UI is best much better than other phones. Its lag free and smooth. Everyday use is best on thisBattery is best best and best lasts more than 2 days with normal use and one day with heavy use. Screen on time is around 9 hours. And the best part is it has the same charger with Samsung provide with s20 series. So i can use my s20ultra with the same charger.Overall i can say its best in this segment if you dont need high refresh rate display but you want best battery life and beautiful vibrant display with better color accuracy then go for it

  Overall this is a phone for non gamers, camera lovers and for media consumption. It has been a mixed reaction with 15 days usage. More details below. Thank you for reading.Pros;Display: 10/10 nothing more to say.Camera:Back cameras are really good with all four of them being useful in different conditions. Apart from the 64MP primary sony sensor the 12MP wide angle and 5MP macro sensor give good quality pics and not there as a gimmick.Front camera is a mixed bag. Under slightly low lighting conditions it doesnt produce great pics and is bit grainy. Samsung please fix this with an update. But if you put the screen flash details are good.Colors are saturated which some will like and others may hate.Network Reception and data:So far so good. However, it is not the fastest w.r.t data download speeds under this price category. It depends on the modem that has been used.Battery: At first the 6000mah battery seemed like a 4000mah w.r.t performance showing battery drain issues. You need to check the device health statistics to determine the culprits. If you have turned on adaptive brightness (auto brightness) then battery consumption will be high. Since smasung uses the front camera for auto brightness. I would suggest you to turn it off. Secondly add apps which you don't use frequently to sleep and deep sleep under battery optimization. Also switch on the adaptive battery optimization. After all this now it finally lasts longer in the range of 40 - 44 hours in a single charge. Again it can vary based on your usage. But these steps will definitely increase your battery life per charge.Cons:Processor: Samsung please use a nice processor in such a good mid range smartphone. This is a downer. Almost everything else is good. Gamers please stay away from this phone. Day to day task are fluid but still you may notice occasional lags while opening some apps and animationsGlasstic Back: If you use a cover on your phone this may not be a concern. However, people who like the phone as is...may not be able to use it without worrying about a scratch.Weight of phone: Along with a good cover this phone can build your biceps. You can feel the weight.Overall people who use a phone for connecting, productivity, social media, vlogging and media consumption then this is a good one. Gamers will hate this for sure.

  I ordered the phone as soon as it went on sale, i.e on the midnight of August 6. I was unaware that it would only be available to prime users so I had to first subscribe to Amazon prime, and during this process the blue variant of the phone that I wanted to buy went out of stock. Nonetheless, I managed to order the mirage black 6gb variant which was the only one available at around 12:25 am.But yeah I would say that I'm not at all unsatisfied with the black one as it looks so stunning. The phone was delivered to me on the morning of August 9, that is pretty fast.It has been 2 days since I'm using the phone and I would say that there is a lot about the phone to boast. I'm so happy to have been able to buy this.Everything about this phone is so awesome but the two outstanding features of this phone are its premium looks and the rear camera. The rear camera captures stunning images in all light conditions and the quality of videos is also amazing. I really loved the single shot feature, its fun to use. One thing that I'm a little bit disappointed with is the performance of the front camera in low light. The sAmoled display is so cool, you won't face any problem operating your phone in the sunlight.The 25W charger is quite useful as it charges the phone at a blazing speed. The 6000 mAh battery lasts longs but I haven't tried extreme gaming yet.So guys just go for it! Nothing can be better than the Samsung Galaxy M31s at this price range.

  The processor is pathetic, your phone would start lagging as soon as you start to use it. I had hoped that samsung one UI won't have many bugs but it has crucial bugs linked with speaker and mic that won't resolve after updates. Sound quality is okay for movies and stuff but pathetic for music. On top of that, Amazon won't accept returns and replacement is too much hassle. I'm used to buying literally everything online but that stops now. The only good thing with this phone are nice display and fingerprint and an average camera with bad camera app. If you can shell out a little more go for little higher end phones with better processor and never buy an Exynos

  Good Phone for the price being a Samsung phonePros -A fantastic display, extremely colour acurate, vibrant, with great sunlight visibilityGood build quality, thought its plastc but looks gorgeousOne of the best camera performer around this price range here I am very specific because I am a photographer by professionInspite being a 6000 mah battery does not feel that hafty & well balenced to holdHeadphone sound output is best in class also the speakers, Media consumption on this phone is a fantastic experience.One UI is better then ever on a Samsung phone now, extremely stable & smooth nowCons -The processor is not that powerful at all, despite being the 8gb varient that I bought shows lag & stutter around the UI every now & then on heavy multitasking usage, high end gaming is also not a smooth experienceThe 6000mah battery sounds much but it doesn't last more then 1 day battery drains so quickly on this phone ( hopefully will be fixed by futer updates )The wifi hotspot only supports 5ghz band its not a duel band one on this phone so if u have a laptop or PC with 2.4 ghz wifi adapter, you won't be able to access the hotspot from this phone, I had to purchase a 5ghz wifi adaptor for my PCOne UI core version on this phone lacks so many features that we found on A series phone so thats a compromise on this phone specially I miss the lack of led notification on this phoneThe Camera to API on this phone does not support Google CameraOn the Camera department , it does not support 50/60 fps1080p, its only limited to 30fps thats a downside for me specificallyPhone does not support some graphic intense apps like .. Adobe Premiere rush, & few moreGorrila glass 3 is not that grat in terms of display protection, so installing a screen guard is a must, also the back is very proan to scratchesThe figer print sensor is good but not that fast like Xiaomi phones, also the face unlock misses so many times but thats also subjected to be fixed by updates.Overall its a good ""Samsung Phone"" if you dont run much graphic intence games or apps

  Poor configuration mobile from Samsung ( Review after a month of use )Following are the reasons:1) They processor performs poorly causing the phone to hang all the time2) The screen touch sensitivity is poor and screen blanks out while making a  call. Need to double tap it every time to get the screen alive ( eg for a IVR call )3) Battery performance sub par.4) Too bulky and fat to use.5) Very poor sensitivity fingerprinter reader. For a left handed person makes  its use complicated due to positioning of the sensor.6) Camera is great quality but for Rs19,500 ie cost of phone I would rather buy a  DSLR camera to enjoy even better quality pics than get stuck with a phone  whose only ability is to click good photos. Remember a smartphones first and  primary use is to make phone calls and its smart use. Both which are sub par.My verdict ..... Please dont go purely on the star rating and reviews published on Amazon.Do your own research and decide.

  I've been using this phone for 2 weeks, extremely happy about the batery backup, fingerprint reader is really cool & impressive.About the camera quality it's been amazing.Apps opens faster and also multitasking is efficient. Really liked the always on display feature and dark mode. Also sound quality is awesome, & with headphones amazing experience as it provides Dolby Atmos feature while using headphones gets activated & you can enjoy the theatre like experience. Also very light weight considering the battery capacity, very easy to operate with one hand & touch sensitivity is also amazing even with screen gaurd. Battery gets charged from 10 to 100 in two hrs. Now no need to carry any power bank.

  This is next level of M31, looks premium. I brought M31 for wife and now I purchased this. After comparing both....Cemera is of next level...Infinity O display looks premium, Side finger sensor feels cool...and finally mobile looks and feel very premium...Just simply go for this.

"
"

  while placing an order i was thinking about better SD chip-set phones ...but after seeing this mobile ....there is no difference performance ...Exynos does Better than expected coz OS is build accordingly....camera & Display =10/10battery=10/10side mounted fingerprint=8/10 (its the only thing not 10/10)feel in hand=10/10 ( premium...feels like 40K device..)social media and  heavy games (except Chinese games (#BoycottChina)),heavy web browsing=10/10!!

"
"

  everything  thing is amazing  especially  battery life and finger scanner and display  is incredible  especially  punch hole camera  on front  side ....... wProcessor is also  good gor basic use it works really  well ..... all sensors nare there and amazing  features  also ..... Night  mode, always on display , one handed mode and a lot more ..... very fast charging  25 watt charger it really  fastly charges the phone .....

  Just got my hands on this beauty today morning, One word, beautiful, excellent display, smooth touch, fabulous camera....will write a more detail review after using it for some time. But first impressions last for long and M31s doesn't disappoint on the contrary it puts a smile on your face !!PS - Disappointed not to get out of the box back cover even for this price segment, had to run from shop to shop to find one as its a new phone in the market, was hard to get one but got it eventually.

"
"

  Battery life is not as per expectation with minimal use only 40% got discharged.Camera quality is better but best. Even Single take feature also not that much impressive, because it not give 10 pics always as per provided information of this feature (or else i dont how to use this feature, if i am doing anything wrong then pls let me know. If any configuration is required to use this feature pls let me know).Not given option of Microsoft office link, so i cant connect my laptop with phone.This is the review after one day use.Over all good.

"
"

  A major drawback which I found; when I'm on voice call, I can't connect to the internet...means you cannot send a photo on whattsapp while on voice call or cannot open chrome to check something...this was a major drawback on my previous phone also...but with today's advancement and latest phone, I did not expected this.....Being a businessman, very often I need to send photos on whatssapp while on call to discuss details at the same time....NOT POSSIBLE on Samsung M31s....rest all things are good at this price.

  Please do not buy Samsung Galaxy M31s model, I bought this model phone through Amazon on 8th August 2020 during lauching fest. Got delivery on 15th August, started using on18th August, today is 36th day, morning as usual I took the phone to switch on wifi to use, screen came on the all of a sudden screen gone total black out, booked service center through samsung toll free number, visted they couldn't do anything much, infact they returned my phone with sreen lights on, they cant do much only requested me to change mother board. I want Amazon to replace with a new phone. I am not willing to use a phone with this sort manufacture deffect.

"
"

  I am using the Galaxy M31s for a few days now. I will note the pros and cons as I have observed so far.Pros:1. The display is excellent. Vivid colors that pop, good contrast and definition.2. The touch response is butter smooth. I think it is at par with an iPhone.3. No lag, no heating issues, no screen problems so far.4. Battery life is very good.Cons:1. There is a huge amount of bloatware. I uninstalled most of them, but some cannot be uninstalled. I disabled or forced stopped them. I deleted 1 star because of bloatware.2. The side mounted finger print sensor is not very convenient. They should have given a normal real mounted FP, which is easier to use. I deducted another star because of side mounted FP.3. The face recognition feature does not work all the time, but that is a common issue across many other phones.

"
"

  Have a phone now with me... over all it is good non chinese and clean UI. I am chinese user earlier switch to samsung this time. Being a normal user it is ok with current processor (youtubers saying processor bla bla bla).Only giving 3 star rating cause no screen guard and case is provided in the box. Which is still not availble in market as well.When you got the box... i observed box quality is quite low as comoare to other brands however no problem..this is ignorable..every companies looking for cost cutting.Phone is good if you are normal user watching media and social networking sites and small gamers.Gamers definitely need to go with realme, mi, other brands having high antunu scores

"
"

  It is Tejas not Rafael.I don't understand why people giving it 5 stars !Camera image quality not as per my expectations.. I was using Moto G5plus 12 MP Camera and I was satisfied with its camera image quality. :-(Battery lasts for 1.5 day.I can not play IAF game in it.  :-(Processor slow, many websites either not open or take lot of time.It is good phone only for average daily use.

"
"

  Things i like ::Excellent Display QualityWatched HD videos on Youtube/Netflix and it was just awesomeThe camera quality and software both are goodOne UI is certainly among the top UIs in android world after Oxygen OSBattery backup is among the bestI was little skeptical about the processing power but i normally play light games so that doesn't seem to be an issue. No issues in day to day task.Overall a good purchase

"
"

  Phone is not upto the mark1. You cannot block any app internet usage2. You cannot see daily internet data usage(Not networking usage)3. You cannot see internet speed in status bar4. Screen recording is not there5. No lock screens gesture6. One tap lock screenThese can be small features  but it helps a lot...I didn't  buy chinese phone to support govt atmanirbhar...I am not satisfied with this product.

  Bought the device on the first day of its release. Have been using the same for more than a week now and below is the review of its real life performance:Pros:1. It has an amazing display. Samsung is an undeniable champion of amoled displays and this phone is not different in terms of its standards.2. The camera, both front and back, are an amazing tool to play with. The photos come out real sharp and detailed. The single take feature is very handy feature and will be a boon for any beginner who will be able to capture amazing moments with a single click.3. The performance is very snappy for daily use. It is not made for heavy gaming, however it will not disappoint for light gaming.4. The UI experience with the One UI is amazing and smooth.Cons:1. The placement of the fingerprint sensor on the power button and that can be tricky for some of the users to get used to with. 2. It is not supplied with cover and that is strange considering all the smartphones in the segment are supplied with one.Hope the review was helpful.Willl update the review if something noteworthy discovered while using the device.

  Excellent display and battery but the delivery  took long enough(6 days) even tho I'm a prime member.overall the phone is Excellent for day to day tasks and mild- moderate gaming. Definitely worth it

  Reviewing this after 48 hours of arrival..So far So good..Haven't experienced any lags..This Samsung One UI is so easy to use than redmi UI (IMO).Build Quality:It is glasstic material in back and our hands are Imprinted ..So better to buy a Back case as soon as possible..On the sides I think its made of metal ..Could have gone with a different material but front looks stunning with a broad screen and a bit curved (4/5)Camera:Gives its best in high lightning areas and indoor shots are good too ....Night Mode is absolutely beauty and the single take feature is woww (4.5/5)Battery:First of all charged it for 7 hours and it took approximately 1.15 hour to charge from 30 to 100%.After a moderate usage for about 36 hours it has a charge of 50%. (4.5/5).Sensor:The side ways fingerprint is new and it is quick enough..Face Unlock is quite a bit slow..(4/5).Overall:Since I am not a gamer i prefer this phone is worth buying and tried adobe Lr Mobile..It is easier to use and in the range of 20,000 with a good UI with a moderate processor ..This is preferred.. It also comes with Knox Security

  CONS1. Battery life not worth the hype. Drains very quickly. Paying 20k for 6000 mah battery and watching the battery percentage go down in front of your eyes so quickly feels very bad. Am normal user, use only and only WhatsApp for office work and calling yet battery drains faster than my 3 year-old Lenovo K8 Plus.2. Unboxing experience not good either. Very disappointing that back cover was not included in box.3. Dated processor shows its mark occasionally for example when searching for something in the native Settings app or launcher.4. Camera performance in absence of abundant light is deplorableNOTE: Am facing weird call drop issue in WhatsApp calls but not sure if it's phone's faultPROS1. Fingerprint and face unlock are both very fast2. Single Take feature is amazing3. Screen, form factor, design looks and feels greatTL;DROverall, if you don't expect TOO much from the battery, you're gonna love this phone. Best non-Chinese phone under 20k atm

"
"

  Awesome phone better than realme and mi phones

"
"

  1. Fingerprint reader is very fast.2. Face unlock is a little slow though it can capture your face in a mid range dark room too.Disadvantage of the face unlock was once it cannot recognise your face it does not try again you'll have to use the fingerprint or password.3. Camera quality is amazing in the light but in the dark there's a little disturbance.4. The battery life is not that good as expected though they have advertised a lot about the battery being 6000mah. It's charges pretty fast.5. Reverse charging also works amazing though you cannot charge it to any phone which uses a B cable. Only C to C phones will work for this.6. A phone cover should have been provided with the amount taken. Plus its a little slippery so a phone cover is a must.Overall it's a good phone but these are a few pros and cons when buying the phone.

  If u r not interested in heavy gaming then can't get a better deal for a phone under 20k.Pros-1) Screen - there is no doubt Samsung does provide the best screen. U will notice that instantly,  and Super Amoled is really something if u r coming from ips led screen.2) Battery - Seriously what they advertise is real it really is a monster. Last from1.5 - 2 days depending on ur usage.3) Camera - This is the first time Samsung is using Sony sensor in there below 20k phone and boy can u tell the difference.  Sony sensor with Samsung image processing is just lit, hands down can't get better camera in this budget.4) Software- Being a past redmi and realme user i can tell how much software is important and oneui is very smooth with no blotwares or ads and works really well. I guess after oxygen os and stock Android,  one ui is right behind them.5) Design - This phone looks far better then it looks in images and overall weight balance is great , doesn't feel heavy at all even though having such a massive battery.Cons-1) No Knox security- Don't be confused by all the reviews u find online, there is no knox security included, idk why it shows secured by knox in boot menu but still there is no such thing. It is such a great and convenient thing I just wished they included it here atleast considering the price budget.2) Processor- It has the same exynos 9611 processor thats in their phone that cost around 11-12k . Come on Samsung why are u stuck on the same processor upgrade it there are several better option available.2) Build- It is a plastic body and is very slippery, so requires a cover ,which is not included in box.3) Screen around the front camera gets automatically and returns back to normal after sometimes, since it is a software bug I hope they fix it future updates , sometimes it stuck out and gets a little annoying.

  So, it has been few days since I got my hands on Samsung Galaxy M31s, and I've got to say if you like media consumption on phone this is the best. Let me divide this into pros and cons.A. Pros  1. AWESOME DISPLAYI mean it when I say this has got an awesome display. The infinity-O sAmolled display is perfect for media consumption. Sure it has not got that high refresh rate that some Chinese phone makers and high end phones are providing, but the qualtiy of the display, is top notch. (Also like some infinity o displays out there this doesn't have any beading or halo effect around the camera cutout) 2. SINGLE TAKE IS SUPERBYou have to use this feature to get to know how good it is to have it on a phone. There are time when we want to capture a moment both in videos and photos (maybe with some filters) This feature let's you have that. It automatically captures the best photos and videos with just one shot. It's not as good as that in Samsung's flagship phones (just because they can capture using various lens and m31s uses its primary 64MP lens) 3. MONSTER BATTERY LIFEWell that's to be expected right? 6000mah should last you a full day with heavy load (like heavy gaming and media consumption) I had 15-20% remaining battery with heavy use. But mostly with semi-heavy gaming and usage the phone lasted me almost 2 days without charge. 4. WELL OPTIMISED PHONEM31s has android 10 with One UI 2.0 out of the box and it's a well optimised for apps and games. I have not faced any stutter or lag while using apps or playing games like pubg and codm. 5. 25W Super fast chargeSamsung provides with the flagship typec-type c Samsung 25W super charger inside the box. Thus it takes relatively less time to charge the huge 6000 mah battery. 6. Non-Chinese phoneSince boycott Chinese products is going on and most of the smartphone are made in China, this is a phone which is made in India so a good alternative.B. Cons 1. Plastic buildSince it's a plastic back it easily picks up scratches. So I recommend to use a case or a skin on this phone. (Case does not come with phone so you will have to purchase it)Well I don't have any more cons that I can think of. Yes it would have been good if Samsung upgraded the processor, but one UI 2 is well optimised for this particular processor so maybe that's why they didn't upgrade the processor.Basically M31s has a good screen, battery life, awesome camera, good fingerprint reader and is a excellent Samsung phone.

  Big thumbs up for this mobile. Looks great. Only draw back is battery not performing like 6000 mah. Hardly one full day with full battery. Everything else is perfect 5 star.Finger print sensor is lightening quick.UI experience is niceCamera is top notchI feel UI needs few more customizations within ONE UI itself. Case and screen guard should have included in the box. Battery size 6000 mah is eaten up by Exynos processor makes this phone battery offset. No advantage of having 6000 mah battery.I think this is going to be the last phone with these many features in sub 20k range. M51 is going to be sub 30k range for sure.Got this phone with exchange and it's a good deal

"
"

  though price great higher than m31 and most specs are similar to the its predecessor, I will prefer M31s to buy as it may sound more future proof. First the things i don't like and i know i am writing cons part first as besides it con part it is actually best phone with everything top notch in its real time usage.* Its processor, in day to day usage didn't find major lags or hang thanks to the great software optimisation with one UI through heavy usage and fast multi tasking might get difficult and i also notice it take more than usual time to power on.* i don't consider it as a con but it is heavy though weight balance is so good that you don't feel it is 200g+ phone* and last one , its about buying a 20k phone ans still not getting a phone case, screen protection and earphones is disappointing to be honest. for initial protection you need these things.* overall couldn't find more negative. i mean there are few small thing but i consider it as personal preference so no complain.some pros-* Its design and its build quality is top notch in the price range of 20k thanks to the added frame and back design.* Its camera department , display is the best* fingerprint scanner is fast though it is parallel to the frame you may need time to use to it.* it is waste actually waste of time to write positives and everything asides cons are great .to be honest i am completly satisfy with this phoneand last thing i prefer 6gb and 128gb varient as it is more value for money . OVERALL A BIG THUMPS UP.

"
"

  Its been a month. The M31s is working perfectly. Totally in love with it.The best Non-Chinese smartphone you can get in the market right now.I was fed up of Xiaomi phones.Pros:Looks daam premium.Display is the best one you ever see.Sound quality is also top notch.No ads in the UI.6000mah Battery works for 2 days.Camera quality improved than M31 and new features added.Cons:Only thing is, as the back panel has plastic glass, it gets finger prints attracted very fast. You will need to buy a back case to avoid this.

"
"

  The best phone Samsung has ever made in this price segment.1.Display makes this phone to compete with the high end flagships.2.Sony sensor is really an add back to this phone since it takes excellent pictures in daylight especially.3.Most reviewers had commented on the processor part that it is not a gaming one but my experience with this phone was different, tried PubG with ultra setting which worked very smooth and lag free.4. Battery perfomance is other thing which stands out and it last me 1.5 days with single charge.5. Fingerprint and Face unlock are insanely fast.The only drawback was samsung could have added a back cover and Screenguard with the box but what I did was ordered the cover along with the mobile.Overall I will rate 4.5/5 for this phone because this really adds a premium feel and experience.Hope this helps!

"
"

  Look wise an excellent product,looks better than m30s and m31, infinity o design looks premium and doesn't feel heavy.Rear camera is actually 16mp main shooter, give you 64 MP image by pixel binning technology excellent one,ultra wide is average, macro excellent.Front camera is actually 8mp gives you 32mp image, average in quality.Display is sAmoled excellent, very well visible in day light.Processor exynos 9611 good for routine tasks not great for gaming.Multitasking and ram management is good.Battery backup is excellent. Inspire of fast charger it takes enough time to charge to 100% due to its large size 6000mAh.Side mounted fingerprint sensor is good.Some software related issues are there which can be solved via an OTA update.Operating system Samsung one UI2.0 is good but missing many features like screen recording etc.Overall a very good deal during this independence Day sale.Of course I get a good exchange value for my one old mobile.If you are not a gamer definitely it's worth to buy.Major problem is its wireless Bluetooth connectivity, auto connect and disconnect frequently, Samsung fix this.

"
"

  The colour combination of the back is so good 🔥. It is normal smartphone like others .And as we know samsung is always known for his sAmoled screen.🙌👌🤘

  I must say that my decision to wait for this phone was a right decision. When i ordered this phone, it was showing delivery on 20th Aug but i got this awsome phone well before that. I must say that this phone is really awsome, new style fast fingerpeint reader, awsome camera quality, fast charger. The phone is really value for money. 64 MP camera , the pics are so crisp and detailed. Pic colors are vivid and really superb quality.I give full marks to samsung Galaxy M31S and would recommend others if anyone planning to buy a mid range phone. I have come back to samsung after a long period, i must say Samsung has improved a lot.

  List of things that I noticed after using for 7days-1. Battery :- As per the mentioned specs the phone got a  massive 6000mah battery 🔋 but as per my usage it lasts hardly for a day ( I didn't try any game and mostly used  for stuff like taking online class ,watching YouTube videos and listening music) but the charger compensates it. It took 2 to 2: 20 hrs to fully charge( depends on condition )2. Camera:-The thing that disappointed me the most is the camera quality of the phone especially the front camera. The front camera is 32mp but the quality of camera is not as good as the no says . It cannot compete with with Chinese co. like Oppo and Vivo in terms of camera. During night even at decent lighting condition the photo it clicks appears to be blurry.White balancing of the photos is not accurate.Live focus is unable to clearly detect the edges of the photos.I previously had Vivo v15 having 32mp 1.5 yrs older whose camera quality is far better from this device which arrived later than that.3. Dark mode is awesome that at night we even cannot distinct the edges of phone and the screen.I loved it4.Design:- Design of this device is 👍 👌5. Sound quality is decent6 Processor: Samsung should have provided better chipset than this.7.While I was taking class on Unacademy within 20mins it got heat up.8.Screen:- Screen is awesome,the s-amoled screen produces awesome colors and the viewing experience is great on this deviceHope samsung fixes the list of problems  I mentioned especially the camera capture during night through the next update

"
"

  Camera : too good. Pics cameout fantastic on all cameras(haven't checked night time performance but low light performance indoors was good) without any over-saturation or discontinuity/fading issue like similar priced oppo /vivo mobiles.Battery: slightly better than m30 and there's 25w fast charging. Almost 5 hrs of SOT on medium brightness n mixed use of media, browsing/shopping wifi.Screen: Its samsung. I don't need to say anymore.No lag of any kind seen since. The only cons i felt r the phone is on heavier side, exynos processor( u'll consider only if u Need to play pubg like graphic intense games on topmost settings)  and may be the fingerprintScanner position, fr some. I got used to it in a day but took my mom 3 days now she's ok with it.

"
"

  It's an absolutely fluid machine. Awesome sensors at the right place. Just wondering if Samsung would make profit by selling this phone at this price. I am sure they are limited quantity and would be taken off soon. The fingerprint sensor is very sensitive and responds with diligence. The great feature is its power-packed camera which not only has extremely powerful lenses, but blended with lossless software to encode it. Battery survives for 2 days, with extensive use for calling and listening to music. I am a lisztomaniac, so you may imagine. Thanks. Very contended.

"
"

   1. It is smooth in grip meanwhile but due to plastic mix body changes of slip reduces.2. Lock button with fingerprint scanner is really a great concept.Double press function, notification tray slide are some features.3. You can have Alarms/Playback/Events/Weather on Lock screen.4. Almost every function is available on notification tray.5. Super Amloed Screen gives you a glance experience.6. Customize your phone according to you.

"
"

  I'm updating my review after 20 days of use. Super display i love it. Great UI. Very good interface (smart switch app) from Samsung to transfer data from old to new phone, effortless. Camera is good, i hope it will improve with updates.I hate bloatware. I purchased 8Gb RAM version, but out of 8 gb, only half is available, it is irritating some times. I observed a bit of lag while playing mine craft. So, I must say that processor can be improved.Overall, good phone, considering non-chinese brand.

"

  Overall good  experience, my rating would be 3.5.Pros:1. Size : Good for movie & gaming.2. Camera : Very good, works exceptionally good in night mode.3. Look and feel : Vivid, typical samsung type.4. Pre- installed softwares: Limited and only required ones. good from security aspect.5. Weight : Feels heavy and when in pocket will definitely make u a feel that u are carrying something worth not losing.Cons:1. Phone heats up if used continuously for 30 mins for phone calls.2. Even video calls and you tube playbacks heats the phone near camera area. Pretty unexpected from an highend phone from Samsung3. Battery: Not a good performance as per 6000 mah. LAsts for a day with normal usage, i.e. phone calls, whatsapp, 1 hour youtube video, and some browsing. To be honest, i am disappointed on battery performance looking at its size especially when Samsung made it a big USP.4. Crux: You have better options in this price range, would recommend to try those instead of blowing 21,500 on this phone.5. Processor: Samsung has not done any big changes in its old Exynios Genre.Must go ahead..But Samsung has been a miser..did not provide  rear silicon cover.Charging cable length is just OK IN length.

  This is amazing value for money mobile, earlier i was using asus but changing mobile worth it.Battery: no worries charge within 1:40 hr, whuch is great compare to other mobiles.Camera:awsome, it captures what you needed.Screen :it's samsung USP it could never go wrong.Processor 9611: i also have some concerns before buying but it's not bad. many review available in internet saying processor is not good, but believe me i play lots of game (Pubg, COD, Asphalt, Mortal combat etc most game size 2.5 gb) , do not find any problem, only difference isduring first time game loading takes few seconds extra as compared to new processors.  So while playing no issue.Screen refresh rate: it's a myth 90 hrtz is better compared to 60, hidden fact is your eyes are only detecting 30 frames/hrtz, so your eyes are not even usung 60 hrtz frequency.Weight: yes it's slightly heavy bit do not hurt while typing or gaming, weight is well balanced.Protection: No comments, I always cover my mobile with screen gauard and back cover,  looks and sturdyness are also fine for me. But for this point you could count on other internet reviews, as i am playing safe with my mobile.

  I have recieved this mobile on 13th Aug, delivery well in advance. Mobile looks and features all looks superb. Suddenly on 21st august the mobile started giving advanced touch error and then screen gone off. Now the mobile display is off. Return window is closed on 20th Aug. Service centres are working only on limited days. I had to purchase a mobile immediately for my daily job. Samsung customer care also giving false information related to service centre. I go to office and find time only on saturday and sunday. Service centre is open only on monday, wed and friday that too with limited manpower. I purchased samsung mobile for the first time and now feeling bad about my decision. A latest mobile with limited application downloaded has suddenly crashed. Waste of my money.

  Pathetic purchase- DON'T BUY GUY'S, full of cheating as Camera quality is literally pathetic, Finger sensor is ""0"", finally it hasn't RETURN POLICY, IT MEANS THEY HAVE LOOTED USE 😵

  If you are not an heavy user then this phone is perfect for you but if you are a student, and  searching for a new smart phone this is not for youIn the first class you will find it perfect but as the class goes on and the 4 or 5 period came it wil start manking frame drops and lagsYou will notice an frame drops in animation while opening and closing of an app, or while switching between apps or in scrolling. I didn't know is the problem is in my device only or if the device is like that onlyI strongly not recommended you to buy this phone because its not able to handel the load of online classes then if you are a heavy user how will it survive in heavy usageAnd please don't trust on youtube reviews of this smartphone they are totally fake.And yaa its camera too its camera in low light condition is more useless then the sit of an dog

  I am facing two problems1. Fingerprint Sensor not so good as my previous  A6 Plus.2. Front Camara is shaking.Apart  from this Amazon packaging  is very  very simple  & bad.

  Received the phone today.  Inserted SIM.  Started phone.  Wi-Fi  problem couldn’t authenticate connection.  Reset whole Router with new SSID and Key.  Reconnected all other devices with new SSID and key including my old Redmi Phone.  All devices got connected except this brand new Samsung.Called Amazon Customer care.  They advised for a hard factory reset.  Did factory reset twice.  Still the same problem.  First impression is the last impression – May be Samsung hasn’t heard of it.  As of now they have allotted a technician to look into it.

  After using it for a week,in this price range definitely a good gadget.Touch,camera,processor speed,finger print sensor up to the mark.A lot has been said for the battery,it charges fast only if you off the net,location,keep phone on power saver than it charges in 90mins otherwise it takes 130 mins to charge,battery drains too quickly than M31.All other aspects are good,one can buy if don't want to go for Chinese one.

"

  To begin with the phone is a complete package. Display gives an amazing experience, no doubt it's a battery monster coupled with 25 watt fast charging, reverse charging offers a great advantage, rear cameras give the best shots in the price segment, they add great variety also, front camera is good, the auto wide angle selfie feature is really handy, but sharpness can be improved. Single take is fun to use. Side mounted fingerprint sensor is really quick. It has Knox security but it's limited as it doesn't have secure folders and other A series features. Though made of plastic it still has a premium look and feel unlike the previous M series phones. Single mono bottom firing speaker is adequately loud but sounds a bit tinny at times. Dolby Atmos is present only for headsets and the music output is excellent. Processor is not made for gaming, hardcore gamers stay away. It's smooth and breezy for day today tasks. Multi tasking is no issue. OneUI 2.1 has excellent improvements over the previous versions. Call quality, network reception is absolutely fine. Internet download and upload speeds are quite satisfactory. Overall it's a great experience. Loved it

  Samsung has been giving the best amoled displays for quite some time now. This phone keeps up with the tradition. There is No 90 or 120 Hz refresh rate so yes that can be an argument as competition offers that.But then Samsung display is Samsung display. You just can't get wrong with it when it comes to watching videos.M Series is known for its battery, and the M31s delivers a punch here. Also, despite a beefy battery, phones ergonomics are pretty well handled and overall grip is comfortable (but sligthly heavy) thanks to back end curves.Phone looks and feels beautiful and the polycarbonate material build quality feels good but I don't intend to test it. Back is a finger print magnet.The Exynos 9611 SOC is good enough for less power hungry games but there is frame lag in certain games which demand graphics. Overall with 6000 mAh battery, a better optimization by 9611 SOC might have led to more than 2 day life, but no one is complaining.Call quality and reception is pretty good.Okay, the best part is Camera! Somehow Samsung has managed to fit a very very decent camera in to this one. Yes colors can be over saturated (5/10 times) but it's the same with most phones these days as perhaps the general public likes punchy colors.Video recording is pretty fine tooBut the winner here is the Night mode. Don't know what got into Samsung's head and they have accidently incorporated a very improved night mode for a M-series phone (less noise and better field of exposure). Its easily the best night mode in under 20,000/- category of phones.Even the 12 MP ultra-wide takes better pictures than other ultra-wides in daylight.Overall a good solid phone. Samsung is always guilty of over pricing (may be their screen costs more or whatever), but still would attract many. A price of 18000/- may just have killed the competition, but may be not this time.Disclaimer:I'm a very casual gamer, mostly see movies on Netflix and Amazon Prime video and so display and battery are my priority and the M31s doesn't disappoint here.Clear advantage is the camera, specially it's Night Mode.The 9611 SoC handles my daily routine well and 6GB RAM eases multi-tasking problems for the SoC. So didn't notice any lag in my experience so far.Min storage is 128 GB, and I really never needed more. You can always use a micro SD card to futher add storage.The review is based on my usage and i feel most of the crowd uses phone for social networking, web browsing and occassional gaming, so any basic SoC can handle it fine.

  Samsung m31s this is a super phone which never I have seen my life extraordinary battery life and extraordinary camera features and superb fingerprint reader fast and accurate than other phones in this phone Face Unlock is also so fast .In the box they didn't provide any case for the phone and no earphones for the phone but in a series they will provide a case and earphones and in the M series wild didn't provide case and earphones I don't know this is I was disappointed in Samsung M series so but the phone is superb and naturally grade in camera quality so perfect and I appreciate the Samsung offices to make a Sony sensor of 64 megapixel super phone in the 2020 year thank you for Samsung officers taking this phone to market

  Another well desinged model from Samsung M seriece with high capacity battery. Android 10 + Dark Mode best combination for Samsung display to viewPros-Design & Display The design of the mobile is awesome with 6.5 Inch Super Amoled Full HD display. Big screen to watch movies. The pixels resolution and smoothness of the screen is damn good. Nobody can beat Samsung in terms of dispaly. Glassy finishing at back side is too good. Edges and screen ratio is fine. Classy look. UI is awesome- Storage 6GB/8GB RAM is definitely huge, helpful for gamers, mutli purpose users. I didnt see any lagging or hanging till now while using. 128GB storage is lot to store-Battery Battery life is good. Lasting 24hours after more use, still 30% or 35% power will be remained.-Charger The charger cable is coming with Type C at both sides. Very fast charging 25W.  Reverse charge is provided in this model which is good option to lend some charging to others (Can use M31S as a powerbank :P)-Camera Came with new feature Single Take which helps you to capture realtime photos and video at the same time (Slow motion video, Fast Forward video, edited photos). Camera clearity is good and decent, Macro, Live Focus options will bring the creative photographer in you, but when I compared with Mi Cam I feel Mi cam sharpness is better-Processor Coming with Exynos 9611 processor. Works really fast and good without lagging.Cons- Since the size is big little bit difficulut to operate with single hand, but now a days it's not a big issue- Fingerprint scanner is not very accuarate, sometimes you may feel disgusting to unlock, even face lock also slow in response sometimes. Can be improved- Sound Quality is good but volume is not much- No indicator for notifications- Unncessary preinstalled Samsung apps- Ads on the screenPrice could have been set 18k as there is no much difference between M31 and M31S in terms of battery, processor, camera (Except Single Take). Must buy for Samsung Lovers

  Using it since last 3 days and nothing significant  o complain other than fingerprint sensor. I guess this is little pricey compared to China phones  especially  comparing to MI Redmi note series which are are almost 40% cheaper and slightly better. Nevertheless I purchased Samsung believing they have stringent quality  checks compared to Chinese.Cons:1) Fingerprint sensor located on the side is annoying since it is tricky to unlock when used with a TPU back case. I would have appreciated if the sensor was on rear instead which would have been very convenient  compared to side to use. Don't use any case if you want the fingerprint  sensor to be less annoying  or choose the ones having sensor only in the rear or indisplay..2) setting  up this phone Initially is very annoying  and consumes lit of time. God knows what updates it is updating in the background which seem i could not find3) Little pricey compared to MI redmi note series phones,  I was using redmi note7s  prior to this phone. The hardware is more or less comparable to MI redmi series phones which are available at much cheaper prices...I purchased Samsung and just avoided the temptation of Chinese  phones in respect to boycott..otherwise they are pocket friendly. Hope samsung reads this review and refund me and bring down the prices a little bit as wellPros:1) Samsung brand, assume completely made in india...not sure how many chinee components  are used though2) display and battery3) decent camera4) does not over heat during normal use

  Good mobile with great changes like..1: Single Take2: Glastic body3: Monster Battery4: Awesome camera with great features

  So after using the M31s for more than 3 weeks, I have a mixed feeling about the device.Things I love about the phone:1. Display2. Clean UI3. Looks good compared to other M seriesThinks which are just Ok:1. The camera is identical to the older M31 and thus is underperforming.2. The battery isn't that monstrous as they claim. Felt like 4000 mAh. But still takes 3 hours and 40 minutes to get fully charged.3. External speakers are better than other M series but aren't good as most mid-rangers.4. Dolby Atmos audio failed to meet expectations as it is only good for enhancing the treble (Great help if you are old).Thinks I hate:1. Bulky and heavy. Feels like some walkie-talkies that I used to have during my childhood!2. Poor performance for this price! Can't even play games like Asphalt 9 without lags and frame drops.3. No option for random wallpapers with the One UI 2.4. Face unlock is pretty slow and thus is an obsolete feature!5. A slippery and plasticky body which acts as dirt and fingerprint magnet. Back of the phone is now full of scratch.6. The phone rebooted by itself 15 times in 22 days which is something scary for me!7. Unable to feel that Samsung signature, I can't explain why but feels like those Chinese brands on hand.

  Guys please beware. Worst ever phone from Samsung. Touch is of pathetic quality. Heavy phone and not user friendly. Very poor service from Amzon. Within an hour I am raising this for return, however No response from Amazon. Time to quit Amazon

  Purchased for birthday  🎂 gift for my brother.  He liked it very much. Great camera 📷, long battery  🔋 life as wanted. Nice touch for fingerprint. All aspect of the phone is on par or above my expectations at this price.Awesome and attractive  back finish liked it very much.Display is 👍 great. With 8gb feature  it's  superfast for all gaming.Sound quality  is much improved  from earlier M series samsung.Thanks Amazon for safe delivery.

  All featured specifications are up to the mark.Camera lovers.. highly recommend for you. #Intelli-cam, #Hyperlapse..But in this price segment, you could have expected Snapdragon 845 or 730G or a better processor in this phone instead of Exynos 9611.Good:•Excellent battery life, Monster 6000mAh.•Reverse charging.•Side mounted fingerprint sensor.•Crisp AMOLED display.•Bundled 25w fast charger.•Easy grip & sleek design.•Camera switching. Thumbs-up.• Has 3.5mm jack. (Thanksgiving)•Note like fealings to mid rangers. With PENUP support.Bad:•Doesn't offer earphones in the box. (Why samsung?)•Old processor.•No back cover included.•No clipboard for cut, copy & paste.•Major missing of important apps like Samsung Flow, Pass and Secure Folder* which you easily get in A Series.Glastic Back Panel is not so impressive when you pay Rs.21k+*Hope Samsung will fix and offer these in upcoming updates.

"

  Battery is discharging very fast. Its a worst  choice  to choose  dis phone. Thought  to hav a long battery  life. But its discharging  very fast.More over Amazon  asking to install a software to check the things. And dat software is not having battery option.Guys opt some other. Its useless.

"
"

  Screen is vibrant.Camera is good.Battery life is superb. One can easily get 2 to 2.5 days of battery on one full charge.One UI provided by Samsung is quite good. No lags or heating for day to day usage.25 watt charger. Reverse charging.Phone is not very heavy.Cons:Phone costs around 20000. Samsung should provide features like Samsung Pass in this phone.Panel is made of plastic. It get scratches very easily. One has to apply back cover to avoid this.No water resistant rating provided or mentioned.M30, M30s, M31, M31s all have same processor i.e.  Exynos 9611, which is based on 10nm. On other hand many cheaper phones are using 8nm processors which is more efficient. Samsung is charging good amount of money for some incremental changes.

  This is my 3rd Samsung Mobile. I was a big fan of Xaomi Redmi Mobiles, had 4 of them; I still am a fan, except for some performance issues, quality and other worrying issues with security, as its Chinese. Don't know when the updates stop as Xaomi stopped updates of its UI year after year for some 2-3 year old models too.Lately after purchasing Samsung Tab.. I am once again wooed and wowed by Samsung Quality & performance.Its SECURITY & PERFORMANCE that landed me here with M31S. I have no complains except for screenshot feature which is easy in Redmi & little cumbersome in Samsung, yet a 5* for everything from Samsung.  I admit and say that this M31S has a bundle of features to explore. The camera is very very impressive and pro mode is simply exquisite.

"
"

  Georgius, awesome!It is powerhouse of battery, camera, processer and smooth fabulous display. It is better than other China's smartphone in this price. Only one thing who gave unsatishfaction that it is time telephoto,Periscope lens but samsung didn't work on it still.I hope samsung work in future immediately.

"
"

  Happy to switch to samsung phones from all other chinese phones i owned previously.Samsung has inbuilt device care app which manages the ram and saves battery and puts apps to sleep when not required. You also get samsung max premium VPN service for free although you will have to select the premium service from samsung max app bcz by default basic service is selected for everyone. Kindly note bcz the VPN is free its slow. Comes with Dolby atmos feature but ya dolby atmos can only be used with headphones and works with Bluetooth headphones too. What I liked about samsung is the dolby atmos feature provided is not there for show it really works amazing when you listen to real dolby atmos content using headphones on the phone . For me I am satisfied with this phone

"
"

  Pros: -In hand feeling is great with unique gradient look.-The cameras of this one is just amazing. Photography might become ur hobby with the ultimate quad camera setup in this device.- Fingerprint sensor is modern and works really well.- Super amoled display and the speakers with punchy sound gives a completely different experience with the multimedia.-25 watts charger is the cherry on the cake.Cons:-A back cover could have been provided because the back is a fingerprint magnet.- A bit advanced processor could have made this phone an asset worth possessing (Only for hard core gamers).Conclusion- Being a moderate user, I am really happy with this Samsung device. It's a big competition to any other smartphones in this range in the market at this point of time.

  Aesthetics :First of all the phone is very good to look at. The glossy finish on the back of the phone where the colours merge looks good. The one down side is back side of the phone is a finger print magnet and be ready to invest in a good back cover for the phone. It would be good if samsung provides a good cover in the package for the phone as they are providing for some models in the m series.Camera:The phone has good camera on paper and lives up to its expectations in the real world. in well lit scenario it provides very good results. The low light scenario is really challenging even for the top of the line phones. This phone is also no exception in low light scenario I see a bit of noise and loss of detail.Battery Backup:The big thing about the phone is the battery and it is able to hold the battery for two and half days of normal usage.Software Updates:One thing I remain skeptical is how long samsung will provide software updates, I think it is for 2 years but I would be happy if get for 3 to 4 years.Conclusion:So, if you are looking for a good phone under Rs.20000 this is a phone that will and should be in the first three places in your list of phones.

  It's not about giving review, it's about sharing my experiences with someone who need to buy this from hard earned money. I don't share my mobile picture because its my whole thing now.Why you have to buy this?1. Mobile look is awesome.2. Performance is really good, behind my expectation.3. Side finger print sensor is working than what you think, meanwhile faceunlock also working soo good.4. Battery stands upto 14hrs rough use, but I'm not try it more than twice.5. Edge to Edge perfection in screen looks and handy to use.6. Don't worry about price because Samsung 25W get know you it's perfect.7. UI 2.1 gives you different experience.8. PUBG is really working equal to other competitors.So why you should not buy this1. If you want a 5G network don't think about this mobile.2. Signal strength is not improved like other M series mobile, I feel its have to look by samsung.3. Battery save mode ( Medium power saving) not perfect as I seen before.4. Faceunlock consumes more battery.Don't confuse by review if you want a mobile classy, good performance and updated trend choose this because it has everything. Expect 5G.

  Feels good to hold. It is a plastic body but still seems quite premium.The camera is good. Not a flagship so  ant expect much. But a lot better than my  previous samsung s8. The single take feature is a load of c**p. Or maybe I haven't used it efficiently yet.Battery backup is simply awesome. Don't.  Have to keep plugging in. But again the 25w fast charging is a load of c**p. My previous moto g6 had 18w turbo charger and that worked a lot better. Though that battery capacity was low as well. But gave me equivalent backup.Screen is the best part. It's beautiful, huge and crisp with minimal pinhole obstruction. Good colour saturation and brightness. Face unlock is just a tad bit slow. Fingerprint sensor is a bit of an issue. New position at the side on the unlock switch but more importantly it is not the most responsive

"
"

  Bought the 6Gb/128Gb Mirage Black variant..- Battery does not feel like 6000 mAh just one day max with medium to robust usage..- Camera is good but the 64MP feels like some 16/32MP..Macro lens also not upto the mark..- Only good thing is display in S-AMOLED..which is again a common thing in all of samsung's mid range smart phones..so not a big deal- Issue with network as wellI simply din understand how a flagship level phone which created soo muchhh hype in the market turned out to be a big S###..Samsung just foxed the customers taking the ongoing anti-china emotion into their advantage..JUST A BIG THUMBS DOWN FROM MY SIDE...

"
"

  Although i was super excited for the product, but after receiving it i was little disappointed for the camera.The camera is not upto the markThe front camera looks like 16mp only and clicks smudgy pics. Plus you have to keep your hand super stable otherwise it clicks blurry pics.The plus point of the phone is it's built quality. Does not looks like it has 6000mah battery. Plus the display is also very good. The side mounted fingerprint button click is not so good, but okk.The processor is really bad, not very smooth.

"
"

  I am a oneplus user. I just bought this for my mom usage. I have been using it for week. After the present situation  of against the made in china products. I just blindly  booked Samsung after gone through  some reviews in YouTube.Totally waste of money. U will find lags in each animation. I regreat for my worst decision  ever.Dont buy if u are looking  for a good product.

"
"

  Simply brilliant! I definitely think this is the best phone to buy if one has the budget of about 20K. The battery is long lasting, the cameras are better than any other phone in its category and the screen is magnificent.The only little glitch is the fingerprint scanner on the left of the phone. It can be really uncomfortable for people with small fingers. And it isn't as responsive as it should be. I had to press at least  twice to unlock the phone. Maybe I am a bit too casual with my touch, but its definitely an issue.However, besides the above minor issue, I think this is a brillphone by Samsung for people who want to have a good viewing experience,  a great set of cameras and a long lasting battery.

"
"

  Excellent photos with Sony IMX682, But low light captures are very poor. Battery is good, can manage two days with normal usage. A bit laggy while playing multiple games Simultaneously with 6 GB RAM. Anyways the screen is super amoled which is pretty much common in samsung devices, watch movies with super quality when compare with Chinese mobiles in this range.

"
"

  All good. Comes preloaded with some 3rd party softwares, that was a bit irritating but all can be uninstalled. Great value for money though. Battery lasts full 24 hrs with heavy bluetooth usage with my earbuds and wireless ON all the time. Takes around 1.5 hrs to charge completely. It has Knox security but remember, it's not water proof so be cautious in rain and near pools, tanks, bathroom, etc. Feeling on screen is good. Great with multiple apps open at the same time. Do not forget to put TPU cover or armor guard with some screen guard. My friend dropped his 2 days old M31s from half a meter height and screen is shattered and gone black completely.  I think original screen replacement from the authorised service center is 8.5k. Better safe than sorry. Worth every penny for this price. I bought in prime day sale so got 1500/- additional discount.

"
"

  This is perfect for day to day usage with fantastic camera quality. There is no full version of Knox security. Processor is not for high gaming. Battery is descent but you can get 5830mah like battery life because of this processor.Display is awesome.And there is a hidden app lock system with samsung max app for data saving and privacy protection.Fingerprint sensor is very fast but face unlock is secure.There is a unique single take feature.And it is a non Chinese  phone.Build quality is awesome.Big screen bright writing  is very helpful for students.

"
"

  Pros - This phone has monsterous 6000 mah battery, reverse charging and Samoled display. Coming about single take camera make this phone more interesting and look wise make this phone best under 20k.Cons - only con is processer. Exynos 9611 since 2 yrs samsung is using this processor in mid rangeOverall pubg is running smoothly because of optimization

"
"

  Lets talk about the cons first.. the front camera struggles in low light, due to the charging cable being type c to type c.. one cannot use it as a data cable which is a little annoying. There is no TPU case or screen guard applied with the phone which makes the phone little more vulnerable and so we have to spend some extra bucks to get to that security.Pros are more than cons. The rear camera is really impressive, night mode too adds to its advantages, the front camera works like magic in good lighting condition. If we turn off the skin smoothness and beauty mode, it produces some good details. Battery life and the charging time is decent. Display is extraordinary. Sound is rich and loud. Don't worry about the processor, if you are not a gamer who streams and plays for hours, it is a perfect phone for you. It works lovely . Moreover it comes with Knox security.

"
"

  This is just an ok product. I ""will not recommend"" it at this price. Only reason I bought this phone was because I did not want to buy a Chinese Phone.The performance of this phone is worse than a Chinese Phone.Only good thing is it's screen size and display.The phone isn't very fast to respond. It hangs frequently. Everytime I unlock this phone the application which is already open does not work.I have to close the app and open it again.The fingerprint sensor on the side button also requires getting used to. It locks often as we hold the phone in our hand as it starts recognising anything on the sensor as our fingerprints which fail to match.If you don't save all the WhatsApp images to your gallery by default, there is no option to save it manually. Such a pain.Google Chrome also won't update no matter what.

"
"

  The overall experience with the Galaxy M31s is great. I like the overall features of the phone specially the feather touch on the screen. For those who are looking for a battery life its a huge disappointment.Two major disappointments:1. Since the phone is new in the market, Samsung should have provided a better experience with One UI 2.5 or 3.0. But there seems to be no plans for the UI upgrade.2. I am a heavy user and the only reason for buying the phone was the massive 6000mah battery. But it seems to be a pretty much disappointment from Samsung. I have been using the phone for a week now and the battery does not perform as expected. I don't play games on the phone but daily uses like Paytm, google pay, Teams, Outlook, Gmail, WhatsApp. The battery does not long even for 8-9 hours. I am sure that it is a paid promotion from the vloggers that they mention about the 2-day battery life. I was expecting the phone to be charged every 2 days, but I have to charge the phone every day. If I want to have a 2-day battery then I have to use very cautiously like not using wifi, WhatsApp, or any sort of heavy use.

  A Very Big Samsung Mobile Fan.First of all, loved the new Glastic design and the side-mounted fingerprint sensor which is very fast.A Very massive battery and the Amoled Display puts a cherry on the cake.The 64 MP intelli-cam is just Lit🔥🔥.The new infinity O display in M series was a great idea.The sim slot is also very unique.Currently using the Samsung M30s, M21, M31s. All of them are great considering their price point.Attached some of the Camera samples.Loved the Knox security in M-series.Reverse charging is a very useful feature.The 25W charger is also awesome.The image processing is awesome and very fast.

"
"

  It is a very nice phone. Loved the always-on display. It's a very large and good display. I am playing casual games. The sound is loud. The battery life is good and fast charging helps to fill it quickly. There was no breakage for me on the Bluetooth front, I am pairing my Sony XM3 with this and I am not an audiophile but Dolby Atmos makes a nice hearing experience for me (XM3 is not Atmos-certified). The camera is also good enough for me (it has Sony cameras). I am not a pro photographer and ultimately all my photos are uploaded to google, so good enough camera for me. So it is a very nice purchase for me. And I hope every person buying this phone (instead of buying Chinese brands) have the same experience. Also do always buy insurance for your phone for at least the first year. I have seen many cases when it comes handy coz you never know when an accident (only to your phone) happens.

"
"

  I personally don't like cameras where it smudges your facial texture in the selfies/photos, this phone cam has a bit of same issue like other new phones where it shows as if u have a clear skin without any dark spots. Other than that landscape pics are very clear, still need to explore the Cam.Disappointingly, headphones not included in the package. No other offers in it like free scratch guard & back cover.Configuration is a bit tricky, opening a Samsung account, syncing, copying & all.Overall phone is good, look wise & applications in it. Love the colour combo, metallic Greyish-Silver & Blue.Will update after a few months, just got it yesterday.

"
"

  Picked up the phone for my mom. Went for samsung as I didn't want to buy a phone manufactured by a Chinese company, if not would have definitely gone for xiaomi.Great phone. Loved every thing about the phone except the plasticky feeling of the back cover. Felt like I wasnt holding a  phone that costs around 20,000 ₹. Have redmi 8a dual and must say that the over all build quality of redmi 8a dual, which cost me around 7000/-₹ when it was launched, is better, at least the phone feels sturdy.Otherwise m31s is great phone. Camera and the picture quality great. The phones responsive. The finger print scanner at the side is a refreshing change.Would have rated it 5 if not for cheap plasticky feeling of the phone.

"
"

  Its A real monster from Samsung M Series that I can't say in few words. Its really user friendly and Comfortable. Overall its too good in All Aspects.Pros* A Cool Design with beautifully arranged side keys* A Stunning AmoLED 6.5"" full HD Screen* A Beutiful 64+12+5+5 MP Rear and 32MP Selfie Camera* A Powerful 6000 mAh Battery* A Descent Samsung Exynos 9611 Processor* A Smart 6GB RAM With 128 GB Memory* A Comforatable Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection.Cons* Price is Liltle more when compared with Other Chinese mobile Phones.* Doesn't come with a back cover. So I bought a back cover. (Amazon Solimo brand).I was thinking about Cons and wasted so many time. Because it's a Kind Of Smart Device When beuty mets the Quality. Samsung Made it Possible. Btw Proud to be an Owner of Indian Mobile. Jai Hind.Don't Think So much....Jus Go for It !!!

  Very bad expirience with Samsung as a company, I am a doctor who is dependant upon mobile so my patients can contact me at any hour. I had xiomi note Pro 7 working fine, due to china border problem ( being patriot) I decided to spend 20000 rs on samsung M31s and I did. On 26 th night sometimes my phone went blank,I came to know when my emergency covid patients relative  came knocking on my door at 4 am accusing me of putting off my phone which I did not do, Samsung m31s did. After working tirelessly for 25 yrs and even in pandemic I was accused of being careless thanks to Samsung. I have lost my patient reports, was not reachable, went to service station exposing myself to 20 people as Samsung has no social responsibility of maintaining social distancing in 80 Square foot space.I am throwing all my samsung things and will not ever buy anything from Samsung anymore and I advise everyone the same.Thanking youDr Sameer

  Wifi signal reception is too week as compare to Mi mobiles. Battery gets discharged bit faster than Mi mobiles.HOTSPOT signal strength is weaker than Mi Note 5 Pro.I would say Samsung must use better hardware if selling these mobile more costlier than redmi and other Chinese brands who are giving better hardware in less cost.I would not suggest to buy this phone regriously.Within a month of use, it has started HANGING even on basic apps opening, processor is not capable to handle basic process and apps.. DISAPPOINTED from SAMSUNG again.

  Samsung Galaxy M31s is the latest offering from Samsung India in the M series of smartphones. Samsung Galaxy M31s is an excellent smartphone and will highly appeal to all Samsung fans in India. With an excellent camera setup which has many intelligent features, the camera enthusiasts will simply love this phone. The only thing that should have been upgraded by Samsung in this phone is the processor which should have been more powerful. The 6GB RAM 128GB storage variant costs ₹19,499 and the 8GB RAM with 128GB storage variant will cost ₹21,499. All in all, this phone is still highly recommended. Check out my full review on my YouTube channel with the same name.

  First and foremost this is a non-Chinese brand phone.Display:With Super amoled display u can ditch ur tv and enjoy the tv like experience in Samsung M31s. The blue filter option can protect ur eyes while viewing in low light.Camera:The best till now. U can stop carrying ur DSLR henceforth if u have Samsung M31s.Single take is a good option in camera where you can capture the best moments and it gives best photos, videos and boomerang.Macro lens option is another plus point to capture the tiny things.In daylight the picture u get out of 64 mp camera is the best.Other best ones in camera are slow motion, hyperlapse, wide angle camera and lot more are there to explore here.Battery:No need to carry a powerbank if you have Samsung M31s. With one time charging you can do browsing, watching movies, playing music, clicking pictures etc. all these in a day and still battery will have another 25% charge.Fingerprint reader is very quick.After 1 month usage of this phone, my recommendation is just buy this phone.

  I ordered this phone before one month.Its working fair enough and having no any issues at that timeBut after one month its start giving headache.Dont trust on Battery capacity of this phoneI put phone in charge and when its fully chargedBattery percentage falling to 0% in 4-5 hours without even using phone.Fast charging is also not working nowSo i don’t recommend this phone.Go for any other brand or model but dont spend 20,000 for 2 months.

  I've gone with this phone for the brand value which samsung carries. The important highlights of this phone are as follows :-Pros ----1- Design2- Look and feel3- Screen quality and colours4- Fantastic cameras5- Small notch with minimum bezzelsCons :-1- Moderate Processor Exynos 9611 which is available in M21, M31, M30s. Which is not suited for heavy usage, apart from that it works fine.2- Back pannel attract a lot of smudges-------I've attached a few camera samples

  One of the best phones I have ever used.This is my first Samsung phone, and I think I'm going to be with this brand for longer time.The most amazing part of the phone is the Camera. The Camera quality is simply amazing. User interface is also very user friendly. It's truly value for money phone. I would have given 5/5 stars but I reduced 1 star because of following problems.Fingerprint reader sometimes doesn't identify and we have to use PIN.Also, Battery life is excellent, but charging fully takes approximately 3 hours which is too long considering 6000 mah.I would also suggest Samsung to come up with brighter and flamboyant colours especially for India to beat the competition for longer time.

  I have used it for 4 days and i feel for the price,  its a wonderful device . Even though you will get a mobile with better specs from Chinese manufacturers in the same price range  but thats the trade off you need to bare if u want a non Chinese phone keeping  in mind the privacy and data of users .Let us look into the pros of this device- 6.5 inch s amoled screen  is dope , colors are too vibrant . I think this is the selling point of this device.-battery is 6000 mah and coupled with 25 w fast charger its insane . It takes little more than 2 hours to fully charge and lasts more than a day .- samsung UI is refined and comes with many features  .- camera is too good ,you will get clear and vibrant pics .- side mounted finger print scanner is ergonomically  placed.Few cons which I have noticed are- processor is weak , they should have upgraded it for the hardware they are providing  .- its good for day to day usage , works pretty fine but not for heavy gaming- although phone is not slippery but they should  have included a cover with the device .

  Phone get heated up very soon during voice calls, video calls n shooting videos... so disappointed...

"
"

  Camera quality is very poor and taking 1hour time to charge only 36% of the battery...worst online shopping experience..as per Amazon no return policy for this product...they want to send a technician to repair this brand new phone..

"
"

  Not as expected. Don't go for fast charging which is one of the slowest. Big battery has not made any difference. I was using phone which was using low battery but still used to get same usage time as i am getting on 31s. Charging takes more than double the time my earlier phone used to take. Photos looked OK. Finger print reader is absolute waste. Nothing more to tell as of now. Not at all worth for money. I waited and bought this as wanted to buy non Chinese, but completely disappointed. Adding - ctakes lot of time if charged from car charger. Even 1% increase takes hell lot of time. Other phones get charged 10 - 15% by thr time this phone charging increases by 1%.Don't know what to do. Samsung this is not good.

"

  Phone is not usable on speakerphone, your voice will not go to second party due to mic issue. Very poor noise cancelation, its basically a voice cancelation. This is my last purchase of samsung. They lost the trust for quality. Now we will switch to other brand.Processor is slow!No feel of having 8GB RAM. Apps loads at same speed as 3GB RAM.Overall quality is average.Disappointed this time with samsung purchase,Color contrast is not as a premium phone amoled.Speaker lacks.At speakerphone, mic does not capture audio properly.Battery life is good. Cameras are average.Fingerprint is impressive..Overall phone is slow in speed rest is ok.

  Relieved that going through those countless reviews paid off. Almost bought M31 but then did not like the low light pictures from M31. As soon as i read M31s had a primary 64MP sony IMX682 sensor, knew my search was over.Pros:1. Camera quality exceptional, very impressed with low light and night shots.2. 6000mah battery lasts almost 2 days with decent usage. Dont need to fret about plugging in every night.3. Clean UI, very limited bloatware4. 1 year complete protection at very nominal priceCons:1. Side fingerprint sensor is too narrow for my male fingers. Could never open lock in one attempt. Very frustrating. Samsung should have gone with traditional finger print sensor placements at back or front. I guess on screen sensor is too much to ask at this price.2. Screen freeze, after unlocking screen if you were browsing or reading, have frequently observed scroll to freeze. Unless i press return or minimize window, scroll dosent start to work. Very surprised to see such major software glitch, hope samsung solves this in future software updates.All in all its a good package. I could over come the cons as for me pros out weight cons.  M31s launch had perfect timing for me as i was looking for a under 20k phone with decent battery, scpecs and an awesome camera. Non-chinese brand was a cherry on top.

  I have used this phone for a week.Pros:1. Fast charging2. Battery3. Camera4. Finger print5. Good fit in the handCons:1. Poor default launcher2. Speed isn't great3. This gadget should have been around 17.5K.4. Build isn't strong.5.  Missing screen recorder.6. On the fly call recording option is missing.

"
"

  I have been using this phone for a month now (6gb ram, 64gb rom variant) and here is my review:1. Build: The build is entirely plastic but does not feel cheap in hand. The gradient design at the back makes it real cool.2. Screen: The screen is one of the brightest and vivid. The colors come out really well and don’t  make the phone appear as a budget phone anytime. The media viewing is actually awesome.3. Battery: I take around 50-60 calls in a day; watch media for 2-3 hours. The battery lasts me the entire day (8am-9pm) and then I have to put it on charge again with 20% battery still remaining. The charger provided is 25w which takes almost 1.5 hours to charge the phone completely.4. Camera: The cameras are really good, especially the output from the primary on the rear one. The pictures are bright with good details in daylight. I also find the night mode to be better than most other phones at this budget. The selfie snapper is 32 mp with good images in daylight; the images appear soft and grainy in low light however.5. Software and performance: This is where the lag comes into play. The device is powered by a age-old exynos processor. I have felt stutters while using apps like youtube and whatsapp. When I minimise the youtube window and again go back to reopen it, sometimes I get only the audio with no video playing. Similarly sometimes whatsapp freezes while I try to take a picture. However, I think these are minor issues and can be fixed through software updates. All other apps run well. I am not a heavy gamer but games like subway surfers, ninja warrior run without any lags.6. Network and call: I have noticed many call drops and voice issues. The 4g connectivity is also not very stable (I use airtel). These again can be addressed through software updates.Overall it is a great budget phone with few software issues. This is the phone for you if you are on a budget of less than 20,000 bucks and a light to moderate user.

  The phone has gone dead in 15 days and when we took it to the Samsung store, we were told that the motherboard is defective and needs to be replaced. The part is not available at the store and we are severely inconvenienced without a phone and having to visit the store during these Covid times. The phone cannot be replaced because the 14 day deadline is over, according to Samsung policy. This defect in a brand new phone is not our fault and we are very unhappy to get a defective and repaired phone in just a few days of using it. This is not expected from a reputed company like Samsung. Very upset. Would like this problem to be addressed urgently.

  Camera quality is very bad. Very disappointed....

  The Exynos 9611 processor in this phone doesn't affect its performance experience in-person. You'll barely notice any performance lags in day to day tasks. Don't stick to spec sheet comparisons, you'll barely notice the difference in performance while using it side by side with other phones. It is a very solid and beautiful phone. Full charge in 1 Hr 45 min which is quite fast considering 6000 mAh battery. The screen is beautiful and cameras are great.'About phone' section shows it has Knox security but I don't understand why it doesn't have a secure folder option and any other option. Knox is there but I am confused about its purpose.Also, UI is scaled down and doesn't have a 3 finger gesture screenshot, no screen recorder, no edge lighting, and no Gcam support. Other than that everything is superb especially no bloatware and ads, unlike Chinese counterparts. Also, it has very good privacy control options. Also no issues in call reception and signal.

  I like the phone for a lot of things considering the price point it falls in. I use samsung S10 as my second phone and despite a bit bulkier than that because of the battery size, I like the touch sensitivity, the screen quality and crispness of the display and the touch sensitivity despite applying a screen guard.The battery lasts almost 1.5 days and the phone does not tend to hang. I use it as my office phone and Light gaming, so the screen real estate makes it easier to use the phone. I also would say that samsung has done a commendable job with the software, UI and there are a host of useful features similar to the high end S Series.... I find the earpiece sound to be quite loud and the speaker to be 3.5 on 5.You can go ahead and buy this phone if you are looking for a budget device that satisfies most of your requirements.

  Not at all happy with this phone from a reputed company. On the 10th day after purchase, I had kept it for charging in night and in the morning saw the screen to be blank and unresponsive. Took it to the service centre and they said the screen has broken due to fall. I felt that it was on the bedside table and may have fallen due to my movement in my sleep so asked them to repair it. The service personnel said that it is a new launch so parts are not available and he doesn't know how long it will take. I have still left it at the service centre and it's been a week, haven't heard from them.Most surprising thing is that Samsung says it has Corning gorilla glass 3 and Corning claims it to be scratch and drop resistant. But if thephone fell in my sleep from the bedside table which is 22 inches high and screen broke then all claims are false. It even had a screen guard installed. My several other phones have fallen many times but never broke. I will never ever buy a samsung phone again.Others should also think before investing their hard earned money in these times.

  After all the smartphone from samsung this one came out to be all rounder at mid range category. Except processor, which is having a decent performance, everything is fine. Looks is good, light weight, good camera, great display. Battery drains bit faser considering it has 6000 mah battery and S Amoled screen, expect this to be resolved in future updates. If you love photography, specially pro mode then go for it, it has impeccable pro mode the iso works the same way as dslr. See the shot attached. You will hardly find any noise. Low shutter speed with tripod give you amazing result. I love this phone because of its camera.

"
"

  I was very happy with my purchase, because I found this phone after doing a lot of research on the Internet comapring a lot of mid range phones. The 'M' series provide very very promising specs at their price points and even Samsung's own 'A' series starts at a price point ₹10000 higher for a similar specs phone in the 'M' series.What went wrong is that my phone's touchscreen went unresponsive on it's own about 7-8 after the phone arrived and i couldn't get a replacement from Amazon because of their ''7days'' return poilcy. And surprisingly I couldn't even get a replacement from the official several Samsung service centres, because they prompted me that ""The M series phones are malfunctioning quite a lot and replacement parts for this series is not being supplied by Samsung "". So i decided to get a refund coupon that could sadly be applied at ""Samsung Brand Offline Stores"" only!. So I ended up purchasing a Samsung Galaxy S10 Lite as an upgrade, because the Samsung 'A' series line-up is just so stupid, having the same specs as 'M' series and being ₹10000 costlier.

  Using from 5 days, Satisfied with the phone so far! Here's a real user review from my end:********Pros********•Premium AMOLED Display! enhances your streaming experience.•6000 mAh marathon runner with Fast juicing capacity of 25W•Fingerprint accurate & Fast•Cameras give excellent output for a regular user. For Camera Geeks, you have a plethora of features out there!•On Performance, it's snappy in day to day usage. Though not 90Hz, its touch response is smooth and it adds to performance!********Cons********•Graphic intensive Games like PUBG might lag!I've played PUBG, it performs smoothly upto 1hrs or when you play in Solo/Duo/TDM, But when you play with Squad, phone heats up a bit after 30 mins, lags & shows stutters on prolonged gaming!In simple, its for those who chill out with friends & not serious gamers!•Other cons: No major issues noticed, Will edit when I see one!*******Verdict********Who should buy?•It's perfect for those who then owned a 2yr old Mid-range/Budget Device or 1yr old Budget device! Someone who've used flagship earlier will be disappointed!•For those who don't game everyday•For those who want Camera ready phone giving best pictures!•For those who watch a lot of content, it might be a Mid-range device but a Flagship in Display!

  Writing this review after few weeks of usage:Pros:1) Display: Probably one of the best display in this price range. Outdoor visibility is good, display is bright and vivid.2) Battery life: It truely lives up the hype of its battery. It's monster battery easily gets you a day with heavy usage and continuous usage and few time on gaming.3)Performance: The overall performance is excellent for day to day usage. Handles routine multitasking with ease. So far I haven't tried any heavy end games but I'm preety sure it can handle it with ease. Samsung is giving regular updates to make UI work smoothly.4) Camera quality: It is it's strength as well as bit of weakness. Overall general photography is good. You get a good color reproducibility in day light with Standard camera. In wide angle mode, image quality decrease and image tends to be over saturated at times. Night mode is okiesh but not great in extreme low light conditions. Selfi camera does great job for selfies and also for group selfies. Samsung has added lots of features in camera app to overshadow the shortcomings of camera in this phone. 64MP is just a number, don't fall for it. Regular 16MP mode shoots photos mostly upto the mark of most of the people. Overall Camera is not the best but above average for this price range.5) Fingerprint reader: Well it's fun to use. It's very precise and haven't been able to fool it yet, so feeling relaxed 😜. But accidentally you tend to unlock the phone though you don't want to. But with routine usage, you'll learn how to avoid it.Cons:1) Weight: With this huge battery inside it, the phone weighs heavy. If someone has habit of putting it in upper pocket of shirt, it will be difficult for day to day handling.Overall, it's more than a value for money phone and a definate upgrade over M31. Go grab one for yourself.

  It is only  non Chinese brand. Other than not value for money.Fingerprint reader works well.Battery life is good enough.Camera quality is not comparable with my very old phone Gionee Elife E8(2015) and Nokia N8(2010). It is laggy and not delivered sharp photos as my old Phone. So I have to wait for Google Pixel 4a. Samsung Galaxy M31s actually made for modern girls(slim design and beauty cam). I am not a gamer nor so much app user. But I've noticed this mobile is laggy. In every time when I open Google Photos in my high speed wifi, it takes much time than my 5 years old gione elife e8(3gb ram). Who have this mobile they will agree with me. Because my mobile (Samsung Galaxy M31s) is not defective, it is OK condition.  But it has limited capability and capacity which is not worthy for this price segment.

  Have been using this phone for a week ans I must say its quite impressive,  key feature of this phone is charging speed,  it charges from 0 to 100% in about 1 and 1/2 hour which is pretty fast considering the massive battery size- The 64 mp camera works flawlessly-The fingerprint scanner is placed very well, it detects almost 8 out of 10 times accurately and is very fast- A great phone for a regular user , the speed with which all apps open up is incredible- The hidden  feature of Transcribe lets you type a statement in a documented format as you say, which is a great feature for students and office goers- Lastly, the front facing camera is superb and the multi foto features saves your lot of time while taking photographsIssues that I have with this phone- No back cover included in the package- No clarification about the Knox Security as mentioned on the phone- Polycarbonate back cover, please replace it with Gorilla Glass protection( it gives a premium feel to the phone)- Battery drains a bit faster compared to M30s

  My review after using this pgone in all aspects.I am using this for last 3-4 days.Excellent camera - Good low light photography. 64 Megapixel does its work. Inteli Cam is just awesome.Display is Superfine even in direct sunlight it works Excellent. Touch is just Excellent.Phone looks really cool in hands. UI is good. Speaker sound is good. Phone charging time is little bit higher. Battery backup time would be better.Overall it's a very nice phone.

  This mobile doesn't justify its cost.Cons- IT hangs too much where only basic apps are installed not single games are running in this situation its hangs tooo much means you will get annoyed ,No led indicator  provided to show the notification .Battery life is not up to the mark,Camera is goodWhen I received this package it was just wrapped in plastic packet . No bubble Wrap was provided.Lot of dust on mobile when I open the box  . Thin plastic cover was not even wrapped as new .I have bought this on EMI and canceling might cause me fine from bank so I have to keep it as there is no Replacement only return is applicable.Even Samsung box was having scratches .

"
"

  In the box contents:1. The phone2. Type-C to Type-C data cable3. 25 Watt fast charger brick4. A SIM ejector pin5. A user guideAbout the device:Looks:I bought the mirage black and it looks more premium than it actually is with all the gradient finish on the back.The front looks absolutely fantastic with the BIG 6.5 Inch super AMOLED display which looks gorgeous.The tiny hole punch camera on the top middle of the screen is so tiny that you wouldn't even notice that the hole exists sometimes.You get a 3.5 mm headphone jack, Type-C USB connector and a speaker at the bottom.The volume button and the power button is on the right side of the phone and they are reachable.The fingerprint sensor is embeded into the power button and it works just fine.Performance:The overall performance is great, deals with the daily tasks with no issues.The 6000 mah battery is a champ and you can easily get through a heavy day with 40% battery remaining in the phone.The talking point here is the display of the phone. With the ppi over 400 the quality of the display is absolutely fantastic. For media consumers this is a gift and the massive battery combined you can go on and on watching your favourite shows on this beautiful display.Coming to the charger it is 25 Watt and it comes IN-THE-BOX which is GREAT!The charger will take the massive 6000 mah battery from 0 to 100 in about 1 hour and 50 mins which is great and enough for most of the people and the back-up you get from it is good too.Overall:Great phone for daily use and content consumption with great display and great battery life.If you are looking for a phone for gaming I wouldn't recommend this. But otherwise you can just buy this phone with no doubts what so ever!!

  It is the best M series smart phone till now by samsung. The camera quality is awesome(both front and back), expecially i liked the micro 5MP camera. (Attached sample shots )Other camera features like ONESHOT is quite amazing and gives a premier feel. Overall camera quality is very good having the sony sensons. The amoled display by samsung is fantastic. Figerprint scanner is quiet responsive but it could have been a bit faster. And the last thing is the Huge Battery with long batterg life. For moderate use the battery last for around 1.5-2 days, which is amazing. For heavy users it last for a day.Very Satisfied and Happy with the product. And one of the best in Price.

"

  Purchased it as a gift for my wife. Looks, build and performance is excellent. I myself have  S10+  but  comparing the price ranges of both these Samsung Models, Galaxy M31S is a better choice. Its battery is still showing 25 % even after 72 hours ( moderate use )  where as S10 lasts only 24 hours.  Delivered much before the expected date.  Earphones , not included in the package is disappointing.  Fast charger is great. Biometric scanner on side home button is not convenient. NFC is also a miss. Cameras are excellent .Overall a  five star deal. Thanks Amazon.PS Please take care while buying covers for this model. People are selling  M31/M31s covers As compatible  but there is size difference of .1 inch in these two models.

  Not happy with the product, complete waste of 20,000 rupees,extremely heavy phone, phone thickness is much high,Extreme poor screen resolution,Low grade chienese phones are better as compared to this phone,Multi shot mode is non sense,Camera quality is poor,do not buy this phone

  I'm using since 4 days ago but I'm facing too much voice breaking problem  and this is not my first phone,  I got replacement  ,but same issue facing in replacement product  ,I'm not happy with this product.

  I purchased this phone going by the rave reviews but it turned out to be a huge disappointment. The selfie camera is just okay. Haven't been able to test the rear camera that much due to the pandemic situation. Phone is slow and hangs when using multiple apps and switching between them. It also hangs when you turn off the screen while using an app and then turn it back on. Sometimes one has to click several times on action items to get a response. Fingerprint scanner takes an entire second for thumbs. I ran all the benchmark tests and this phone fared very poorly for it's price bracket. I had Redmi Note 7 Pro before this and even that fared significantly better. All I can say is that it was more of a downgrade than an upgrade for me. Battery backup is good though, as is the display.

  After going through specifications and youtube videos of many brands of mobiles (i let off all chinese makes) I zeroed on Samsung M31s. I had to wait a month as it sold like hot cake on launch day. Now that I have got it in my hand, I am really happy. It has 64 mp camera, 6000 mah battery and it charges so fast with new C charger at 25 w. It is handy and not to much weight. It has wireless calling facility too. One thing which gave me tension was the low audio volume of incoming calls. Suddenly i started worrying about my hearing capability. Then went through the settings and found that the default volume was kept for under 30 years old. May be the mobile took me to be one below 30 years and I am happy about that too. But my  Ears were not happy. Then Eureka !  I found here is a facility to personalise the audio volume too. This I am posting because  in  many  elderly persons face  with this hearing problem.Cons-------The  inward audio is kept on top but sometimes give trouble particularly when you have mobile  back cover. Same way face recognition is not very successful.

  phone is utter waste

  Decent for day to day use but with some irritating issues and some useful functionality miss.Phone has a powerful battery, no doubt about that. Where my earlier phones with 3200 mAh battery used to drain twice a day, this phn doesn't break a sweat it easily lasts for 1.5 day. Although 6000mAh battery increases the weight of the device significantly.Look, Display and design of the phone are amazing. Looks good at both front and back. Gradient bacl gives phone a premium lookMemory management : Samsung does not live up to expectations here. I was using a 6GB Realme 3 pro before this but never had  my phone freeze or hang, but this ""Monster"" by Samsung is not so good to handle applications, I have seen high RAM consumption and device do hang sometimes which is quite irritating given it being an 8 GB memory phoneFingerprint sensor : probably most impactful irritating thing with this phn is the side button fingerprint sensor. It is not very smooth, takes time, since surface area is small, finger misses it many a time, and sometimes if my finger touches it while picking up the phone it gets disabled for 30 seconds or so. Surely never going for side button sensor ever again.Camera: Ohh the biggest disappointment. From the setup which it boasts of quality of pictures is not up to the mark. Night mode is not the best in segmentMissing Utility apps: When some companies are offering many utility features that can be useful, this phone lacks such features . Team can research by looking at some other phones and introduce new features to increase utility.So by the overall review it is not a phone I would buy if I had any non-China product with decent reputation. But since we do not have any other option I think it is a phone I can live with. Hopefully we will have better Indian players in this segment and then we can have some improvements

  The product is nice from its price prospective. Samsung has really gone ahead since last year pushing lot of features in its One UI which also looks great with its AMOLED display. In terms of display I think currently non of the other brands/neither its own predecessor are in competition with Samsung. The phone looks premium because of its glasstic appearance and a slight curve around the front pannel nevertheless the material is rightly said as plastic. Careful selection of tempered glass is essential as to protect the screen. The battery seems to be preety good. Started setting up the phone with allmost 50% took around 5 to 6 hours to complete setting up the phone and the battery was still at 46% and after allmost a day later it is at 38%...quiet impressive. But have to bear in mind even it's bunduled with a 25W fast charging adapter it will take atleast 60 to 120 minutes to fully charged. Let's move to sound, I think the speakers are ok ok type as you maynot feel the quality bit distorted, however with nice set of headphones along with Dolby Atmos plus UI sound settings the sound quality is nice. Moving to the next segment front camera, I felt it could have been improved with indoor shots you can easily she the selfies are whitewashed, there are ampule of options to edit but the major part is how the original image appears, so I am not quiet impressed with front camera. Primary camera is nice indoor shot was good. Need to try with night mode.

  I love the phone barring the below cons1. Due to processor the UI lags sometime2. No case or screen guard in the box3. Screen gets scratched easily without screen guard may be due to Gorrilla Glass 34. No samsung features like Alt Z available only core variant of One UI given5. Wifi speed are less not sure why.Pros1. Excellent Screen for media2. Good Battery life as due to processor getting only 7 hours screen on time. But the SD counter parts are getting same even with 5000mah battery3. Fast FP sensor4. 25w charger5. 3.5mm jack

  1.Best budget phone under 20k throughout any brand..best thing is its non chinese unlike those fancy companies..Superb camera quality, superb Portrait shots2.Battery life doesn't seem like 6000mah..ita last 1 day easily with moderate to heavy usage3.Screen is that thing which anyone will fall for..feels like a RO water display so much detail so much crisp. Movies with a earphone or good quality sound box feels like theater at home4.selfie is not that great ok ok tye5. Always on display feels Premium6. Daily normal usage feels buttery smooth unlike the gaming in it.7. Main problem is Internet, i feel internet runs slower than other devices8. As my title Little compromise so the compromise is its processor..Too much outdated now..now 7nm processors are coming and samsung still using Exynos 9611 10nm architecture processer which is a little disappointing.. rest is good9. Back panel feels extremely premium if u don't use the back cover but a back cover is recommended for long term premium fit and finish.10. Fingerprint reader fails 6/10 times if u don't set ur finger properly  Don't overthink just buy this phone u will never ever regret this deal for upcoming 1-2 year.. Good luck

  The moment I unboxed this amazing phone, I was in awe of how it was made. It's amazing at all the aspects Samsung boasts. First off, I'd like to tell you about the processor, the Exynos 9611 chip, it's one of the finest from Samsung and is also found in it's more premium and high range 'Galaxy A Series' like the Galaxy A50 and more. Secondly I'd like to tell you about the display, it's mesmerizing is all I could say. The Gorilla Glass 3 makes the screen all the more protective from scratches and also buttery smooth. It comes in 6GB and 8GB RAM models and either one of them would perform proactively and at it's best.The 6000 mAh battery is to look out for most in this smartphone. In simpler words. It just never quits! You just have to charge your phone once till 80-85% (in my case) and you're good to go for another whole day and still be left with enough juice to go on about the rest of the day without charging it halfway.The 25 watt super fast charging proves to be a champ in charging the phone at a blazing fast speed, leaving you worriless about the time consuming practice.The phone is a sleek looking one albiet it's also just a little bit heavy because of the insane 6000 mAh battery it consists of. Overall it looks amazing in your hand and it had that head-turning-vibe.Sony IMX68 sensor in the cameras prove to be a supreme highlight of the phone, it can take crystal clear pictures effortlessly. The night mode, the food mode, the slow-mo, the 4K mode, and even the normal 720 & 1080p modes are wonderfully constructed by the software. Like I said, this is a finely crafted smartphone. On top of that the side mounted finger print sensor does it's job simply and efficiently (which also means blazingly fast) for you to nothing but simply 'tap' and bam, you have your phone unlocked.Surprisingly, this phone, though being a mid-ranger model, is protected by Samsung's top notch security software 'Samsung Knox' which, if speaking in simple terms, if you have this phone, you can go about doing stuff on it like you usually do and leave the hard work to Samsung for protecting your device against brand new as well as age old malwares and viruses.

  I bought this phone with some confusions as it's having Exynos 9611 processor and Glasstic back, but after buying it I'm fully satisfied. I know chinese companies are giving Snapdragon within this price range but Exynos is a good processor for non gamers and day to day usage. It performs smoothly and honestly I haven't seen any lags. And the most important thing is you are geeting the brand value of Samsung.Pros-1. Great Display- Super Amoled display with drop notch makes the viewing experience great 👍2. Big Battery- I'm a heavy user but still I get 1.5 day's battery backup. It comes with 25 watt fast charging which charges it's 6000 mah battery within 2 hrs.3. Brilliant Camera- There is no doubt one would get the bestest camera in this price range. The main 64 MP camera with Sony IMX makes it the best. Samsung's intellicam works great even the night mode and macro camera works fine. And the 32 MP front camera is superb.4. Weight Distribution- The weight of this phone is almost 203 gm. as it's having 6000 mah battery but Samsung managed the weight very good, and it doesn't feel heavy in hand.5. 3.5 mm headphone jack6. Good audio output with dolby atmosCons-1. Glasstic back- if you don't use cover there is a high chance of scratches.2. No TPU case- Samsung should have provided a tpu case within the box but they didn't so you have to buy it separately.3. Gorilla glass 3- It's time to give gorilla glass protection 5 as consumers are paying 19k-20k.Overall one can definitely go for this phone as it's non Chinese and a great deal within this price range. I'm very happy with this phone.

  Its a nice budget phone with huge battery power you can use it whole day and still some percent of battery will remain and has a premium display and very smooth to run,but it doesnt have a secure folder till now but comes witha knoxx security.Overall a good experience.

  The phone is actually nice. But nothing is perfect after all.1. The camera quality is amazing. But the screen starts to flicker when we try to use the slow motion video feature.2. Battery life is fine. If you keep the mobile data switched on all day till you sleep, the battery drains which should not happen easily as it is said be of 6000mah.3. The main problem is that the vibration feature doesn't turn off. It doesn't have any option to turn off vibration for messages.4. Operating system is good. Not faced any problem till now.5. The samsung keyboard should be upgraded a bit. It is easy to type on Google keyboard but not on this keyboard.So in my opinion, this cannot be a ""MUST"" buy but surely a good buy.

  Hi don't buy mobile in amazon send defective mobiles 2 times same problem

  If you are reading this review it means you are interested to buy This New Beast from the house of Samsung. Trust me it's a beast. Firstly let me clear something, I am not a gamer and mostly played light weight games just to fill up vacant time. Now coming straight to the point. Before having this device I was using Samsung A50 which was also a pretty good device, and just before that I used to have one plus 6 which is also a good device comparing the other brand available in market but during that time I never felt that Samsung can improve such way, and the result is M31S. It's a champ if I talk about battery life, touch sensitivity, fingerprint scanner sensitivity, screen quality ( It's super amoled), sound quality, network reception, no call drop issue, crystal clear sound from earpiece as well as from loud speaker which has pretty decent loud but soothing sound considering the price. Now come to the main highlighted point by Samsung which Camera, I am very much impressed though I don't use this feature very frequently but it can capture sharp and clear images. But as you know no one is perfect in this world so this device has also some drawbacks but can be overlooked easily if you want to have a good smart phone where your personal data is at lower risk. Cons: Camera makes images little over saturated, Some applications need time to get open and close (It seems they got hanged but soon they will be operational) which can be fixed through a software update. And it has Knox security. Thanks for your valuable time. Keep supporting Samsung and allow them to do good work.

  I was using Samsung Galaxy M30 - 6 GB-128 GB - 5000 mAH - Tri Camera - 13 MP for not more than a year. I replaced it with Samsung Galaxy M31s - 8 GB - 128 GB - 6000 mAH - Quad Camera - 64 MP AND I literary found no any difference in both.1. The 4th camera - Micro Lens - is totally useless. It is not at all a micro lens. It gives the same results as close shot by any other lens.2. The 5000mAH battery of  M30 was better than 6000 mAH battery of M31s. I was getting M30 backup till night 9 - 9.30 pm and now I can get backup till 7 pm with same usage.3. The ram again is not make much difference. I doubt Samsung really has using the given configuration and improved the design.Finally, it was my WRONG decision to go for M31s. It is useless.

  The back body has a opening, can see the battery and other peripherals through and through.Suggest to buyers - Please check properly when you get your piece.Not happy with samsung.

"
"

  Screen - 10/10, mindblowing.Looks - 10/10, feels premium.Battery - 11/10, absolute beast.Touch - 10/10, fluid and super responsive.Camera - 8/10, not too great but performs well in low light and has good features.Performance - 8/10, though it has a somewhat weak processor, it doesn’t lag rather performs really well even when simultaneously running different apps.Security - 8/10, it is secured by knox on a hardware level only, so doesn’t have a secure folder like the high end models and A series. But it is way more secure than other android phones from different brands.Value for money - 9/10.Overall - 9/10, if you are not into gaming and would like a phone which does absolutely well in other aspects, then this is the phone for you.

  The screen went black on 16th September, i.e. after about one month's use. Samsung Service Centre initially said that there is some software issue. Later on they said that the mother board needs to be replaced and they don't know how long it would take. The matter was taken up with Samsung and nothing has been done so far. After six days, the repair status on their website says that the service order is cancelled because warranty papers have not been received by them, which is absolutely rubbish because their Service Centre accepted the phone only after verifying the warranty details. Absolutely third rate service and phone by Samsung.

  Bought it on very first day of the sale 6th Aug, got it on 8th or 9th ....delivery was good.Then after 4 days of use the phone got BLACKED OUT.Checked with Samsung service centre, the display was dead, they said you need to replace the phone from Amazon.Callled Amazon, booked a technician on 13th August, got an appointment of 16th... Technician did not visit instead said you come to my place to get ur mobile checked. When I refused he cancelled the visit stating customer not available.Called Amazon again booked another appointment with technician after two days i.e for 18th Aug. Phone was checked technician approved the replacement.Called Amazon for replacement, they refused as the product was not available, i waited for more 2-3 days still it was not available.Then I requested for refund, they were ready to give, refund request was processed. Date - 23rd Aug.Pick up was scheduled the very next day, delivery guy came to pick up the phone . He refused the pickup as the phone was in dead condition.( Amazon service team did not inform them the phone was dead) understandable.Scheduled another pickup my calling Amazon stating the same problem. But no was has visited to pickup the phone.It's 26th Aug today. Only God knows now when the damn phone will be picked and I will get the refund.#DisappointedAmazon.Totally disappointed with Amazon team.

  I selected this phone because I don't buy Chinese phone and support made in India. But at this price Samsung disappoint me because camera in slow motion not working at night lights. I want to upload a video but amazon not upload it.It's blinking when we take a shots.  Very bad 👎. People of India please if you wanted good cameras then don't invest your hard money at the product

  for better camera buy only nokia 7.2 and install gcam. M31s camera also good , details and exposure is great in daylight shots but in low light m31s fails against nokia 7.2 with gcam(My friend have nokia 7.2). Front camera in night gives poor details in images.Overall  design is awesome . I purchased m31s because of its dispaly and design. Battery is good also.But i recommend to buy simply samsung m21 if punch hole display and macro camera doesn't  matter for you. M21 has also good camera. My brother  purchased m21 seven days ago and i see the difference in pictures, Minor differences in camera between  m21 vs m31s.

  This is the BEST BUDGET PHONE samsung has ever made. i wanted to add a photo of the phone but after using the phone, I don't feel like taking pictures with other phones.To start with, when I did the unboxing, I felt like I was holding a premium device the minute I took it out of the box. To be honest, It feels more premium than ₹80k phone. Here's my take on the phone....Biggest Improvements -1. The camera (64MP) is flawless and capture details with amazing contrast. Intellicam feature is just AWESOME.2. The side mounted fingerprint sensor. It is the faster than many flagship phones I have ever used.3. The Punch-Hole camera (infinity-o) Display. It is just BEAUTIFUL.4. 4k video support. Just love it.5. The battery (6,000 mAh) get me going for 2 days without charging.6. 25 watt (type c to type c) charger is included in the box and fully charges my phone (0-100) in 1h15m. Perfect !!7. The AMOLED screen is the biggest highlight. Plus Samsung makes the perfect displays.8. Expandable Storage upto 1 TB plus dual sim slots. Highly user friendly.9. Selfie camera (32mp) is very very very sharp.10. Other amazing features like, latest software, scheduled dark mode, scheduled blue light filter, etc make it the best buy ever.Biggest Downside-NONEMy SuggestionSTOP THINKING AND BUY IT RIGHT AWAY. YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT AT ALL.Hope this helps.

  This is my review after 1st impression of Smasung M31. The phone looks cool a bit bulky but that's okay it has a humungous 6000mah battery. Screen is outstanding. Battery is marvelous. CAMERA is also good with tons of features. Haven't played pubg yet but hopefully it will perform good. The phone is designed and produced in India. Security is no concern with Samsung.And and fingerprint sensor is lightning fast.UPDATE: PubG runs great at smooth and extreme.

  This is best choice to one who loved ❤  brand name with good features and in reasonable price. Samsung finally have made device to compete with Chinese firm in Midrange segment.Pros,Camera- with sony sensor (gives quality pictures)Display- super amoledBattery- 6000Design- premium lookCons,Fingerprint sensor- slower (sometimes doesn'trecognize your finger)Processor- 9611 (very slow browsing experience)And that screenshot option really bad, need to try 4 to 5 times to get it done. Hope samsung will chage it in next update.But I'm satisfied with above, as this device have many good other features and brand name.

"

  First of all I know tech related knowledge.Samsung never disappoints anyone.I saw poco x2,Redmi note 9 pro max,Readme x2,Readme 7 pro.I compared all of them but I choose Samsung m31s.I recommend everyone.Pros:This big super AMOLED screen umma😍This big battery life which comes one full dayThis camera with song imx686 sensor lovely cameraTriple slot with 2 sim and 1 micro SD cardThis design with dual finish.Lovely designDolby atmos speakers with dolby atmos bug sound with only one speaker.CONS:The first one is processor exynos 9611This processor is old but kk processorBut seeing all the pros it is kk to have it.

  I am buying any Samsung phone after a long time. I actually love phones with stock Android and Samsung's UI is near to stock, no boatyard, no apps with privacy issue and an Amazing Super Amoled screen. Video viewing experience in this phone is great. Love its cameras and big 6000 man battery gives you juice for 1.5 days at least.I got it in discount so not feel I am buying a budget phone and I got eve for the price I paid.Just have a request from Samsung to give Led notification feature as A series have.

"

  Got the phone today but I m not happy with its performance. I don't know why the ph is getting us excessively hot even on attending calls. My cheeks r burning. Battery is not that good as expected.  It drains quite fast for no reason. While typing this comment I have seen fall in 2% of Battery level. This is not expected from Samsung ( remembering this have a 6000 mAh battery ) thinking of replacement. Will use it for 2 more days till den. Let's see how it goes.

  I got a product on 10th August and at that time everything was fine. on the night of 14th August, I was playing Pubg and suddenly my phone went down and after trying all the resort finally, I called customer service from there they send me the technician to inspect. on 16rh august technician visited my place he sends the report and my refund process is initiated as there is no stock availability. really disappointed with this incident I doubt will buy this device once again.

  Comparing to the Chineses Phones, the Samsung Galaxy M31s gets best in class camera, a premium design, and the superfast 25W fast charging.  the chipset is Exynos 9611, with more RAM and storage, it is super kool phone for gaming experienance and smooth UI. u wont feel the Charging to be done frequently.The One UI has far better software experience, a good set of cameras, and a big battery which we all have matter of concern.ProsAppealing AMOLED screenExcellent designExcellent softwareMonstrous batteryGood camerasConsKnox security is not available

"

  Please don't go by marketing of this product. The same configuration is available with other brands by 15 K to 17 K.This phone could have the best by 17 Max, not more than that.Its the same experience as other Samsung phone in this range.I must tell you Samsung has meet Peoples expectation by matching all feature as Redmi... including look if you put some cover on the phone.Camera is Good...Rest your choice how u r analyzing the features , price and comparison with other brands.

  It's nothing like monster things..camera is okay not very good. Phone is also not looking cool 😒I can't able to connect it with my laptop as it's having both side c-type charging wire

  Monster PerformanceAfter 3 weeks of usage, I must say, I am fully satisfied with the Samsung Galaxy M31s 8GB Mirage Blue Smartphone.Great battery life,Great Speed,Fits in your palm grip (others complain about its less breadth, but I am more than happy),No nonsense pre-installed apps,Little expensive,3.5 mm jack for audio,Type C charger,High-speed Charging,Its 'Single-take' option is amazing taking Video and Photo at the same time,Only need to put a snapdragon processor instead.

M31s with exynos can't handle 90 hz refresh rate6. Gaming experience not so great7. Misses out on high screen refresh rateExynos 9611 SoC that has been making the rounds on several A series and M series phones over the past year. Rival phones from the likes of Xiaomi, POCO and Realme use Snapdragon 720G / 730G or MediaTek G90T chipsets, which are more performance-oriented. If benchmarks are looked at, the M31s’ scores do fall behind.

  Samsung Galaxy M31s, I ordered this phone in Amazon's first sale on 7th August. And this phone was delivered to me on the 13th of August.  So I am reviewing this phone today on September 9, after using it for 27 days.Design : This phone is very good in terms of look and design.Display : The screen is very good, no problem watching videos and browsing the internet.Camera: The camera of this phone is also very good. Captures high resolution in 64 megapixel.Front Camera: The front camera does not take clear pictures, it makes it slightly fed up.Touch Response : Touch response is also very good, no problem. No lag problems were seen yet.RAM Management : RAM remains in memory for a long time. RAM management is very well optimized.Sound : Speaker volume is very loud but not like stereo speaker.Internet Speed : Any website opens in seconds. Internet speed is also great.Battery : I noticed a battery drain issue in this phone. I don't know if the other user's phone has a battery problem or not, but the automatic battery in my phone keeps getting low. And while using the phone, 1% of the battery runs out in 3-5 minutes. Sometimes 7 to 9% of the battery in the phone ends up on its own in a few hours. It seems that a 6000 mAh battery is equivalent to 4000 mAh.Heating : This phone also has a heating issue, sometimes when charging the phone, the temperature reaches 48 degrees and 42 to 43 degrees in normal use. And in WhatsApp calling, the phone gets very hot and the call is cut automatically.PROS :Good Camera QualityBetter PerformanceFast ChargingAwesome Display QualityCons :Battery Drain issueHeating issueI hope Samsung resolves these issues in the next update.

  M31s was delivered on 31st August.  Love the phone.Macro snapshot feature of M31s clearly shows the veins of a leaf.The photo of the phone has not been taken from a M31s.Pros:1 The power button  is  also a fingerprint reader and recognizes quickly. Similar results with face recognition.2. Almost Bezel free display3. Macro camera is impressive4. Phone is good for average gaming and doesn't drain the battery quickly5. Phone charging is pretty quickCons1. Sound quality could've been better but I'm still giving it a 5 star2. The phone doesn't come with an ear phone or back cover

  Great Phone for the price.. I know you can get a better Mi or Other Chinese company phone for this price.. But the thing is I've used them...You can customize their android and comes with m9re features for sure .. But.. You can't.. never ever compete with the hardware quality of Samsung in any way.. i mean.. you'll definitely start feeling cheapness after using those phones for a while... while Samsung phones maintains their perfectness, thanks to superior build quality and technology! And That's my review!

  I am fully satisfied with the product. Everything works great on this mobile phone. After usage of more than 2 weeks my ratings are as below (out of 5 stars)Display = 5 stars. The super amoled makes you feel the differenceCamera = 5 stars quad camera set up works great in all conditionsSound quality = 5 stars. Headphone sounds amazing. Speakers are also loud.Network connectivity = 5 starsIt seems that samsung has worked a lot to achieve this satisfaction.I highly recommend this phone to others.Thank you.

  Hello Everyone, I was waiting for such great phone from first look of M31s release, Everything is great, Camera is giving great experience at this price range, battery is completely monstorous, what a great capacity, look is very stylish, Ram 6 gb and Internal 128gb provides great support. Fingerprint also in different position gives new experience. Samsung always gives first preference to security, In M31s security is also best. I request you all to select Samsung and boycott Chinese brands.  From last 9 years I am using Samsung mobiles every time Samsung gives better as expected. Thats Why I love & trust Samsung. I am also thankful to Amazon for providing best services and great partnership with Samsung. #ThankYouAmazon #ThankYouSamsung

  This smartphone is  awesome!! I have had it for about 18 days and it is great!!Here's  a detailed review:Build Quality- Although  the material  is glastic , the whole gradient look is quite awesome and almost seems to be metal . A little tip though, invest in a good clear back - cover if you don't want to  get your fingerprints  all over it.Camera - The 64 MP rear camera is great !! It captures every single detail beautifully.The ultra-wide lens is far better than several others in the same price range and has near to none curvature of field .Macro-camera is simply phenomenal!! You can 'see' the 5MP in all the details. It could even capture the pollen grains on the inside of a flower!!The night mode is works like magic !! It transforms photos at dusk to photos of a jovial afternoon. And the Single take ! It's  perfect for capturing one - time occasions like Birthdays.Display- It's Samsung people!! You know the display is going to be the best !! The punch hole camera really does make quite the difference from M31.Fingerprint Sensor- Instantaneous!! And the position is optimum. After a while, it almost becomes instinct.Battery- Monster!! Absolute monster !! It can power through 2 days of mild usage and 25 W fast charging..I don't  even have to plug it in for a hour to get it from 20% - 100 %!!Software and Performance - Neat. It's seamless. The One Ui 2.1 feels great. I have to say .. In the set-up it does try to install a great deal of apps but still other than that, I see no problem.  Some of Samsung's Own apps are great..I have run several games at once on this thing but still , not a lag.Verdict- Go for it !! If your looking for a phone under 20k , this is the best  you'll  find . The display, the battery, the camera everything feels perfect .

  The camera quality simply superb and battery backup is better. The performance was comparably better with other models. My suggestion is good to buy.All aspects of the phone are on par or above the next segment.The display is gorgeous.Lookwise, it doesn't feel like an M series phone.FP sensor works well although it can store only 3 fingerprints.However, it has some good outputs6000mah battery with 25W fast charging is awesome. (Got reverse charging as well).The dimensions are also the same as A51. So you can use the same tempered glass but cant use the A51 back cover for M31s since it should have the cutout for side-mounted fp scanner.

"
"

  Amazing phone with outstanding battery .  Really a monster phone as advertised by Samsung . I have been a iPhone user and just thought of trying something not very expensive from Samsung stable and bought this phone on Amazon and this has not disappointed me even a little bit .Using Samsung M31S for last 3 weeks and can vouch that its quite a decent phone for those who want a large display , long lasting battery , lot of internal storage , super fast & reverse charging .Just a small manufacturing defect - small rubber protruding from back cover but that was not related to performance so can say overall a very good phone at a decent price .

"

  I booked M31s on 6th August 01 AM but it's deliver to me on 15th August. I'm using 6/128 GB variant.Please don't buy exynos 9611. Except photography and display nothing is special to me. In photography also u will find a problem if u r going to capture a business card or like that you'll not get clear on edge to edge. This you'll find when you're going scan through any scanner app too. Not OTG compatible. Kirin 659 also better than Exynos 9611.In a single line i can say I'm very much disappointed.

  Galaxy M31SStand out point1. Camera2. Built3. Software4 . Charging5. Weight management6. Audio qualityDisappointment1  battery: avg, not so great , I m moderate user with mails and whatsapp more rather music n videos, still I have to charge it by 12 hrs. I can't understand its discharging criteria.2. Flipkart  parcel handling,  it came with big cut on box, piercing box pack till leaflets, thank God mobile was safe.Phone is worth being a stand out if battery claims its numbers

  Nothing great in this mobile,lot of social media hype, I purchased this to avoid china mobiles, but a 100% disappointment from samsung I will never go for samsung mobile again in my life time , frankly it is like a China mobile with build quality ,plastic body, camera  Nokia 2mp is better than this ,worst camera experience, 30s is bad in camera what my wife is using, 31s is more worst camera than 30s, waste of money it is like 7k budget mobile, my earlier redmi 3s prime is 100%better,I ordered redmi note 7 pro for my father before lockdown for 8.5k, which is very nice in camera point of view. I strongly recommend don't go,weight of mobile also more

  1. I have disappointed with front camera, it is 32 mega pixels but the quality of photo's is not really good,  when you zoom the pic it's not looking clearly.2. Samsung is not providing ear phones, screen guard or cover case.3. Charger is having C3 connection, so charger cable is having C3 pin for both the sides. so you can use cable for reverse charging with other devices but we can't use same cable to connect with USB or power bank.4. Even it is 6GB RAM the mobile is not so quick to respond.5. 6000mah battery for new mobile  it is coming 1 day if we use data continuously.6. But good thing is single take photo option.

  Everything about the phone is just perfect.Camera is great, even in low light it captures light well. Even My OnePlus 6 does not capture that amount of light in night mode.Battery life is really good. Only thing is it takes time to get it 100% charged, but that's again because of 6k battery size.Looks are just awesome, the screen is dynamic and feels premium. Colors are vibrant as well.Sound quality is good, it does have Atmos. I still have to explore that option, but I hope it delivers good sound.The side finger scanner responds slightly slower if you have used some other high end mobiles. But I think it's is not something which will slow down the performance.Watching 4k videos is just amazing. You will love it.Overall I would say, it's much premium feel and does the job well. I am using OnePlus 6 as well, but really happy with this M31S phoneJust go for it

  Its been around 2 weeks I am using this phone. Lets talk about the drawbacks first--It can store only 3 fingerprints.-If you leave the app open and open the phone after sometime, the app doesn't respond. I find it quite irritating. I thought its in my phone only so I ordered a replacement from Amazon, they did it without any issue. but new phone has same issue.-Weight is much more to hold it for long in hands. :(Things I like- - Monster shot - Amazing- Screen resolution and quality display is commendable.- In this price, there is everything that others 'good brands' are delivering almost at double.Lets see how it goes.... :)

  I got this phone less than one month ago. It does not have any protection from water.the phone was accidentally dropped in less than half feet of shallow water and was removed within seconds.But the display stopped working.The samsung service centre in hyderabad checked it and said that a charge chip which connects display is gone.But the irony is that part is not available at samsung service centres in Hyderabad. I am calling up all the samsung service centres in hyderabad but couldn't get the spare part. Waiting for the service centres to get the parts in a week or so.  This clearly shows how delicate the phone is and most importantly samsung has not made available the required spare parts to its service centres. Keeping my fingers crossed and hoping for an early miracle.

  Device is just too good to view content in very aspect. A 6000mah battery haven't impressed a lot becoz of obsessed ONE UI running in the background, but it took me for a walk all over the day. No complaints on ram management and app response times with no lag. Though a glastic back, which can be covered by a premium back case, the screen seems to be flawless and perfect. I had some network issues with the device in my area. Network grasping of the device near villages where we usually feel very low network ranges is very poor. I tested this with my other two mobiles and came to know that data speeds are very low on m31s. But in towns and cities and places near to celltowers the network speeds are amazing.Camera is most attractive featute of the device. Thanks to its fantastic dynamic range.Overall, the device is a perfect all rounder at the price point with many pros and little cons. Not to say perfect, but stands out on its mark.Maynot be a value for money product but you can go for it blindly if you are day to day user.SATISFIED WITH THE PRODUCT.

  While i was searching for a non-chinese phone - Samsung came to my rescue, it was about to release M31s, a replica of M31 - with very few minor enhancements. Was eagerly waiting for it and at last ordered on the launch date.Ordered at midnight!! A class delivery - reached quickly on 10 Aug.The expectation was almost met with the phone - with the satisfaction of not using a Chinese phone.I am not a gamer, so did not notice a drop in performance so far.Display is crystal clear and camera is good. Yet to experience in depth camera features.Finger print scanner is descent enough and face recognition is also good - though disabled it.The battery life is good and stands for 1.5 days with complete basic usage - WA/Mails/Calls.I have to come back after a better usage in a month or two.I agree on the decision to stop earphones, as we have our own desires on the model - but I would recommend Samsung to add a basic silicon back case going forward in the box - so that we can use it from day-1 with ease. This phone was quite slippery, so had to handle with extra caution. I ordered the case, on the same launch day.Overall good, but the price could have been much more competitive - as almost the same price as M31.On a side note - i also saw some bad experience with few Users where the phone did not start-up and went dead in 2 days. I think those are very rare conditions and could happen with any electronic gadgets. Samsung/Amazon should definitely get back to these clients and serve them as quick as possible, to maintain the customer service.

  Samsung M31s - Good camera quality with high-resolution pictures. Perfect battery backup. I use this phone the whole day after a full charge and the phone has a good battery backup. I like the phone and pictures clicked from this phone is far better than the other phone in the same price range. I love the Samsung m31s quality and processor. Almost perfect in the given price range. Value for money.The sound quality is also good in videos, youtube, songs, and also in video recording.

  I received the phone which had it's screen damaged on the edge. And I have to return it. Not sure how they claim it to be gorilla glass..Camera is good.But disappointed that it's no more available in stock.

  Battery life and camera quality is good but the Samsung chipset is still the old one and this can pass you off sometimes. Your phone will start handing as soon as you do multitasking . This happens even when you are not playing any games or even not using any heavy application.Also the camera quality is good but it is definitely not 64mega pixel.I am writing this review after 10 days of using this phone.

  The product is undoubtedly a market mover I. Its range, keeping in mind the fact that this is a Non-Chinese, trustworthy brand that is made as well as assembled in India. Now talking about the phone, the UI is amazing. Previously, I owned a Samsung J series smartphone and then switching to this is such a lovely experience for me.I have done a full charge test, and believe me the fast charging is an icing on the cake which unexpectedly comes with this handset. My phone took a total, to charge its monster 6000 mAh battery, 107 minutes from 0-100%. The optimisation truly works. The battery backup is good, sound and video qualities are Uber awesome. Camera is well designed. Screen looks premium that you may find in samsung flagship models. All in all, I'll give you a big thumbs up if you have made up your mind to buy this phone.The only problem with me is the processor, it could have been better than this when we are paying more than 20k for this. Never mind, I am more than happy with the chipset and processor because I am not a very heavy user. I hardly play any high-graphic games on this. For me, it works good.If you want a phone that meets all your expectations in a range of 20k, blindly go for this. I have the 8 gb 128 gb variant, and I got a flat discount of INR 1500/- through my HDFC credit card on the prime day sale on 5th of this month. If the offer is still there, go and avail it if you've a HDFC credit card with you.

  Review after 20 days usage:Highlights:1. A WOW display ! - A vivid display with stunning colours and sharpness, which makes an amazing viewing experience. Videos and photos are a pleasure to watch.2. Battery - 6000 mAh monster battery - easily lasts for more than 30 hours with average usage3. Design - A more premium looking smatphone at this price segment4. Camera - 64 MP quad camera surely lives upto its expectations. A plethora of options to exploreWhat could have been better:1. Fingerprint sensor - the side mounted finger print sensor could be annoying at times. Not so fast2. Taking screenshot is not so easy - a simple button in the top navigation panel could have been awesome.The overall performance in my last 20 days of moderate usage has been excellent. The touchscreen works smoothly. So far, I dint encounter hanging while using any of the apps. A very satisfying and pleasant experience so far with the mobile.

  This phone makes me saying this, you can't judge Samsung by just its specs. Using this phone from last 5 days, and believe me, it worth every single penny, I spent, At least for me.Upgraded from OnePlus 3T, and reason behind loving this phone is, it's epic display and buttery one UI. And, this are the only thing I care for, because I am not a gamer, so 9611 is more than required for me. As far as there is no lags in UI, it's fine for me, and there is no lags at all.In hand feel is also good, while holding this no one can agree that it is having 6000mah battery, Thumb up for this. I was able to pull out ~9 hr of screen on time. And speakers are also enough loud and clear.If you are not a HARD-CORE gamer then go for it. (Reason behind highlighting hard-core, many people play 2-3 rounds of pubg and refer themselves hard-core gamer, No you are not. And who plays games like COC, you don't even need to think)Let me tell you again, It's UI and Display is insanely great. After this, I really really think, OnePlus's Oxygen Os is totally over-rated.One more thing, Samsung do not provide case and screen protector out of the box, this is not a big thing, still annoying.

  Facing issue into network connectivity. I've 2 Airtel number and on calling to the number using in samsung galaxy m31s most of the time I've says the number you have dialed is out of network coverage area while on second or third try the call is successfuly connected and again after some time same thing repeating again. On other number using in different device has no issue.Trying to test one or two more days if the issue persist then I'll try to replace it

  Must Buy in the mid range . Best Display , Best Camera , Smooth Performance.1. PERFORMANCEThe performance of this phone is perfect. BUT NOT FOR HEAVY GAMERS . Normally 1-2 hours of PUBG is OK but not for several hours. Its processor is bit Older but its optimization is so much good . You will not face any single issue regarding its performance.Fingerprint Sensor is working smoothly. But face unlocking takes few seconds as i think it is for security purpose only. You can change the face recognition settings to fast mode.2. CAMERAIts Camera is the main highlight in this phone.it shots pretty impressive pictures . If you are selfie lover then GO for it. It wont disappoint you. In low light also it takes quite good pictures.3.BATTERYUhh!! It has a huge monster battery of 6000mAh. You can understand the backup of this phone. I cant say anything about its battery. Don't bother about its battery backup.4.DISPLAYThe samsung AMOLED displays are in TOP in the market. Awesome display I can say...........................................................................................................................................................................................And Yeah Samsung gives variety of features in this phone. You will find interesting about it.Till now i haven't got any issue regarding this phone.NOTE  :  NOT FOR HEAVY GAMING.Overall a Best Phone .I hope this finds you HelpfulThank You..

  Pros:1. Excellent display & Camera good not Excellent2. Better sound output3. Battery is very good4. Support for Widevine l1 (For streaming Full HD contents of Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc)5. Glastic back6. HeadphoneCons:1. Lots of bloatware (Even if you choose to skip while setup, it will eventually install later on)2. No NFC3. Little heatup issues then and there4. No phone case or Screen guard provided5. Year old processor which may slowdown with updates6. Network problemI haven't tried any games yet. So cannot comment on the processor's maximum capability.

"

  I mostly like the camera which has a lot of great features, the main part is the awesome battery lasts up to 12 hours of continuous usage of apps and games. Usually, I start using my phone morning 7 and it lasts till evening 7 and the 25 W superfast charger charges my phone within 1hr 40min, and it uses Exynos 9 octa 9611 it uses a 10 nm semiconductor which is a little bit old processor even it is old it performs great because it has multiple core support(4x2.39Hz with 9 octa-core) and Mali G72 mp3 GPU so in gaming pubg mobile can be played in HD High without lag and it gives seamless multitasking you can switch between games and other apps easily with a single Slide Navigation bar gestures). I have not used mobiles with Samsung's Exynos processor, I just brought this as a try but this amazed me. The fingerprint scanner and face unlock is very fast and the display is great, it comes with an infinite-o-super Amoled display and I can watch my favorite series and movies on Netflix and Prime video in 1080p and I can experience the Dolby atmos in wired and Bluetooth headphones or earphones The gradient color and design is elegant I love it so I've brought a transparent case and it is also secured by Knox you can see in settings and also when the phone gets booted up. I heard that this was the competition for one plus Nord, by my experience, it does with the camera and battery and other things are the same. This is the best phone at this budget.

  A perfect phone at 20k rangeThe screen is gorgeous, no doubtIt looks great, the metallic back looks almost premiumCamera module is to the point. Quality of photos it churns out is unbelievable, comparable to oneplus in my opinionBattery life is definitely not a problemA few pointers so you make the best lf the phoneThe processor is good but a bit aged. For best performance, switch to a static wallpaper and Remove the unnecessary apps that can be removed and disable the rest. I use the nova launcher as it's faster than Samsung's home screen.All in all, it's a phone that's amazing to use and really I'm impressed with the camera

  See.. I'm being a tech enthusiast, writing this review!!! I've used this phone for almost 2 weeks!! See first of all I'll tell u that if u r a gamer don't prefer this phone..if u are a normal user u can choose it!!I'm being a student I faced no problems or any bugs using this phone!! The One UI which is the latest one is very user friendly and gives u a Very premium experience while using this phone..See, in a phone the hardware is important but the software should be optimised too otherwise there's no use of being a high level hardware..see it's battery is the best.. display is very amazing..6.5"" sAmoled display is a decent size but it's colors and saturation is very Greattttt guys!! Trust me, if u want a non Chinese phone under 20k it's the best thing u can get for a normal user like me!! I use the phone from 9am to 11pm continuosly nearly I keep my phone for 2 or 3hrs aside,It gives me a full day battery experience..I charge 1time in morning bas! So battery is the best!! Thumb's up 👍🏻 Now coming to camera it comes with sony imx 682 sensor which clicks very accurate photos in day and night too!! See for this price the night shots are also good not that bad!! If u will use night mode for low light shots it can click the best...but if there's very less light then better use flash😉 So conclusion is u can buy this phone and it justifies it's price so u can go for it!!🤟🏻

  Awesome  product....must buy in sale season....looks cool in hand... color decent..super ambled view is like HD View in phone....great UI.Only battery lasts till 1.5 days so doesn't  look like...its 60000Mah.Doesn't  connect in smart view option in MI TV.Back cover and head phones not available  with product which is a drawback.

"

  I gave ip one plus to buy this. I am totally satisfied on the performance. I have used apple phone  too but thus one is the best. 8 GB Ram makes its performance superfast in the digital highway. And with clear photographs and videos, I am not disappointed. Excellent camera for selphies, too. Battery life is great as i recharge only once despite a heavy rush of Company emails  global teleconferences and other stuff. Fingerprint reader is better than the best.

  Don't buy from Amazon  I received not working charger after reaching custumar service they told me that we can't replace the charger we can replace the full mobile after that I say ok do it then they told whenever the product comes in stock we'll replace them but still they didn't did anything and I tried 2-3 times and I contact  them today 27sep now they are saying we can't do anything nice....and I'm prime and regular customer

  Ordered on 06/08/20 first day of sale.Superior built quality and  premium in look for this budget amount. 6.5 inch sizes are convenient to handle.Exynos 9611 works fine with 6 gb ram .Exynos 9611 is a high level processor - comparable with helio g80.  No lag in pubg. No heating problem.Excellent battery performance - (6000 mah )  ,  above average camera  , sound quality and super amoled display makes it attractive with this price.

  The overall product is good but the camera is pathetic. Being the 64 MP it has very poor image resolution. The picture quality gets deteriorated on just zooming it. The front camera being 32 MP is giving by default 5 MP image and with two person in it gives 8 MP, but has the same image deterioration on zooming it. What is purpose being 32 MP on when your getting 5 & 8 MP picture.  The Samsung needs to seriously look on such issue of camera image quality. As they push this model based on the 64 MP sony camera with better resolution which was lacking immensely. Even the Amazon technician did not resolved the issue and has to finally return the product.

"
"

  Over all this phone is amazing basically my brother bought this for him but i exchanged it with his old samsung note 8...and i instantly became a huge fan of it...Good things about the phone is you cannot empty the battery even after long hours of gaming(PUBG*before ban*, COD, Modern warfare.etc.) also the finger print reader is way too snappy. I'm a bit of a techie guy and choose phones after reading lot of reviews. This phone is worth all the money you've spent. Plus it looks cool, back cover is necessary its delicate backa nd camera bump. Rest phone is perfect and camera is quite good at this price with some major feature and some useless feature which i dont use at all.I recommend this phone for daily as well as gaming purpose, it serves you well with more then 6 hrs battery remaining once you decide to go sleep after a day usage. Thats crazy.

"

  Impressive camera setup. Have attached samples of 123° ultrawide, macro, food photo & 64 mp along with the pics of the phone front and rear. The battery life is astonishing.. I cud get almost 3 days juice out of a single charge.. I am not an extensive user and I use Bluetooth for my calls. The display is just fab and the UI is ultra smooth unlike the BADA which used to be on older phones. This is the best phone one can pick in the price segment.

  Fingerprint sensor:-Fingerprint sensor is good but not so fast. And once in everyday to unlock the mobile, it asks the security password.Battery life:-Battery life is awesome.I saw one or two movies daily.And I use camera for video recording for youtube channel. Sometimes for 2 hours continuously but the battery percentage drop is just 20 to 30%.And I play games in Mx player daily.And I use phone for normal use like calls, internet browsing, reading books, and watching youtube videos.But I used to I charge only once a day even.And for charging it takes nearly 2 hours.Camera quality:-And comes to camera quality I upload some images taken by samsung m31s. You can see it. And for video recording for youtube videos i use open camera app because in camera app given by samsung i didn't find exposure lock. So thats why I use open camera app.And if you want to see the video quality, check this link https://youtu.be/W0encosL-gUAnd while video recording morethan 1.5 to 2 hours. Phone gets heat lightly at the backside. But after stop video recording within few minutes the heat lasts away.Overall performance:-And coming to overall performance, this mobile is good. Good sound, good battery life, good display.Problems that I face:-1. While reading pdf or using samsung notes app and some other apps, I leave the mobile aside, its locked. After when i unlock the mobile, the app didn't interact for my touches like swiping, or tap to write something. At that time when go to recent apps menu and again click on app from the recent app menu. Again the app works.2. Just today, I have a notification from google play about tez shot game. And while I playing that game I face some frame drops but I don't know thats the mobile problem or app problem.3. And comes to sound quality. It was good but almost sound comes in between the volume levels of 4 to 10. When I place at level 4. The sound was too low and cant able to hear. And while changing volume level at one level the sound drops much.Finally I am totally satisfied with this mobile and I love this mobile. Because it satisfying all my needs like good camera, big battery, amoled display, side mounted fingerprint sensor, fast charging, good speaker.Thank you

  Using  Samsung M31s-6gb 128 gb Mirage  Blue from. Last 15 days, There are 5 things which are pretty Osama:1. Battery life is very good even with heavy Mobile use it goes upto 2 days and take only 1.45 hr to fully charged.2. Mirage Blue color looks great3. Display is Osama s-amoled infinite no comparison with other phones in this range4. Selfi camera is great even you can use it from some distance by just showing your palm towards the camera it captures Selfi so no click needed5.  Quard camera gives a boost with great features like single shot mode for those who are good in clicking pictures and for those who are not good at clicking pictures like me6. I did not find any slowness even when I m playing any games but I am not a hard-core gamer so won't play games like public I am outdoor games lover.Overall a great experience with Samsung M31s. The best part is its a non Chinese product and have better features.

  Worst phone ever from day 2 it's been malfunctioning Amazon has the worst return policy they will send the technician and the problem solution he will provide is just factory reset and problem will be solved but the problem will occur again and then the 7 days period is gone and you can not do anything but to go to the samsung service center and stull your problem won't solve there they will update the phone and tell you the problem is solved sir and if will never occur again and then after one day you will face the same problem. This is how the samsung m31s works for me. Highly disappointed in samsung but highly appreciated the Amazon help mr. Ajmal and Vaishali ji they helped  me getting a replacement after 27 days they restore my faith in Amazon and stated that Amazon will not decieve their customer.

  I posted this review after 2 days usages. Actually, I order this phone for my friend. According to him phone is so smooth and also the screen quality is amazing. Yaahh!!! You cannot get this type of amoled screen from any other brand in this prize segment only samsung providing it!! Both Cameras are very good and screen with infinity-O display looks bigger and brighter!!The battery is massive, the charging time with 25Watt charger (including in box) is around 90-100min but battery back you get with normal social media usages and YouTube usages is around 30-36hrs which is incredible!!Note:- this phone comes with Exynos 9611 octacore professor which is quite disappointing. This processor is 1½ years old. Their is no problem with this processor for normal usages but if you r heavy gamer and want to play PUBG, Asphalt like games in high or Ultra-High graphics then this phone might not for you!!So, at last my recommendation is that , if you r a normal user who not played game alot and only usage is social media and multimedia then must go for this phone!!Bcoz you cannot get this type feature from any other smartphone brand and major highlight is that this phone is made in India and samsung is not a Chinese brand also samsung Knox security is very good!! So must buy!!!But if you're heavy gamer then you can ignore this phone, final decision is yours!!👍

  This phone is best non Chinese option under 20k with best battery and Camera performance. If I would rate it under 5 here are my ratings following after usage for 10 days.1. Battery performance - 5/5It would last for nearly 1.5-2 days for normal usage. Very well optimised under One UI 2.1, 6000mah2. Camera performance - 4/5Sony IMX 682 sensor in Samsung really does good job but after image processing it stays on the cooler side. Single shot option is good for fancy photography.3. Side fingerprint - 4.5/5Its faster than In display fingerprints of Samsung A series.4. Speaker performance - 4/5Its not stereo speaker but its very loud and good single speaker.6. Processor - 3/5Exynos 9611 is one generation old and its good for normal users but not as good as Snapdragon 720g or 730g for heavy usages and gaming. And Samsung should improve it as soon as possible because its of one generation back and Chinese company provide Snapdragons in this budget range.Samsung should also provide Corning Gorilla glass 5 and + as other Chinese phones comes with.Knox security is here in this phone but not its full version.And major missing is NFC support which Samsung doesn't provide in M series but it should as phones range is 20k which is higher.

  I bought this phone for below reason1. Samsung brand value2. sAmoled screen, best display, amazin color reproduction, supports Always on Display3. Best in class camera with sony imx 682 sensor, better than many other high range phones as well.4. Single take camera feature works superb5. Amazing low light photography6. 25W superfast samsung charger in this price range and monster battery 6000 mah which easily works of minimum 1.5 to 2 days7. Knox security8. Cool body finishing9. Side mounted finger print sensor, better than back and indisplay finger print sensor10. Small punch hole display in front for camera which makes screen even better. Thats great as compared to pill shaped 2 camera or U camera.11. Sapphire camera glass. Checked this in one of the m31s durability test. It does not get scratched even with level 7 scratches.12. We can use this phone as power bank( phone to phone charging)13. Dolby audio in headphonesand bluetooth speaker14. Loud loudspeake15.hyperlapse,slow motion,super slow motion video can be taken16.u can switch from back camera to front camera while recordingThis is best phone under 21k range and also easily beats many phones under 30k as well.

  From my personal view, this is the best phone under 20000. Ya, like every phone this phone also have some pros and cons.Pros:1. Amazing display. I Just felt in love with this display.2. Amazing battery life. I am a heavy user and in one cycle of charge, my whole day is easily covered. And charging speed is also high. No heating issue during charging.3. Amazing camera quality. Both front and back are awesome.4. Awesome design. When u will take it in hand it's feels like premium phones. Back panel is plastic but trust me u will not feel it. It's feels like glass.And that Punch hole is like extra cashew in your milkshake.5. One UI is very smooth and easy to use. Dark mode and always on display are one ofmy favorite feature.6. U can control ur notification panel with ur fingerprint sensor. This is my favorite feature of one UI. It's very helpfull. No device will give u this feature.7. No heating issue.8. Knox security is there.Cons:1. Processor is exynos 9611, but if u r not a gamer, then this phone is best for u in this price range.2. Fingerprint positioning should be in display. It's not justifying with amaloed display.3. No secure folder.Conclusion: If u r not a heavy gamer, then this phone is best for you under 20000.

  The performance of the phone is poor. There's a lag in loading the apps and downloading the content on whatsapp. Amazon crashes very often. With a very minimal apps and usage I see it stuck for every few minutes on my 3rd day of this phone usage. There's a connectivity issue in this phone. It drops connection after receiving a call, for every few minutes and requires turning on and off the connections .

  It is best ever samsung smartphone under 20,000.It is the all rounder smartphone from a flagship level brand like samsung wheather its best 64 mp rear quad cameras along with flagship level single take features or its 6000 mah battery with samsung 25 watt blazing super fast charging technology which really raises bars to the end for its competition. AlsoDon't Forget samsung's super amoled screens which makes them super gorgeous  and stylish phone than any other chinese cheap ips display providing brands and its os one ui which everybody knows best os  in smartphone world and last but not the least its samsung exynos 9611 processor which is pretty old but with samsung great os optimisation  i don't really gonna feel itWheather it is  daily tasks working or hard-core gaming it suffice all my needs .As a proud indian I highly recommend everybody to buy this samsung smartphone which is made in India and especially  non-Chinese owned company. 🇮🇳Jai hind

  Pros:+ The display is the standout feature here, just brilliant.+ Battery life is very good & fulfills its promise, lasting more than a day & a half.+ Nice sound too from a single speaker, it can get rather loud.Middling/undecided:= Camera seems good enough but I haven't tested it much beyond some nice indoor selfies in artificial light.= Responsive enough for daily use by a senior person, not intending to use this for heavy gaming at all.= The 128GB storage & Dedicated SD card support is good enough at the Rs.19.5k price range (as of September 2020) & should keep things comfortable without needing to continuously make space available for the long run.Cons:- Samsung's software, had to tinker around & change or remove some apps like Phone to Google defaults because the alternatives weren't as customizable or familiar. Tries to install a lot of bloat during setup. If you like Samsung's ecosystem features then this shouldn't stop you.- The fingerprint sensor isn't as sharp as it could have been & is hit & miss. Being on the edge gives it a learning curve as your finger needs to be positioned correctly to cover the sensor.

  Worth for money but except few things...1) battery runs too fast for 1hr continuous use it runs about 15-20%2) camera clarity is not upto 64mp as 25mp can easily beat the clarity of this mobile3) finger print sensor doesn't match all time4) face recognition is only applicable in very bright area5) internet connectivity is too slowAs a reviewer A series is better than M series as there is difference of sky and earth between A and M series.As I use both  A and M series I got the difference between them.Except this it's the best

  Software problem causes hang out . Screen disappears with flash, in the beginning it could be made ON when plugged for charging. Lastly the phone set found dead , it couldn't be made ON even after technical support from Samsung. Need to move Service center with such a new Branded Phone. Other features couldn't be observed as because the set not run successfully.Product is now at service center for its repair . First time I have been informed about display problem but couldn't be resolved. Further I came to know from service center about its mother board problem. Still awaiting for its repair. Coupon is not provided easily to purchase another Set. Several times contacted Customer Care with email, no one helped to provide Coupon as because the Set was found defective since beginning. So pl beware before purchasing..

  The super samples display is best in class under 20000 category.DESIGN is glastic and gives very premium in hand feelBattery is awesome and 25 w c to c cable is best.its the same charger as s20 and also it's only the super fast charger in this segment.Camera is best in 20000 and got many flagship features  like single take etc.It has Knox only for securing phones and files but no secure folder .So the safest phone alsoThe processor is also nice.i played pubg in smooth extreme 60 fps and game was smooth .Only processor except for g90t to give 60 fps.its better than sd 730g in terms of speed as it has total clockspeed of 16.12 GHz while 730g has 15.4ghz.now it's your choice.both fingerprint and face unlock is very fast.

  All ok , but there is no headset in it nor screen guard nor a back cover. So it would be better to order it separately in amazonif you are buying a new mobile Samsung Galaxy m31s. I think this a not the fault of Amazon I think this  is a mistake done by Samsung. So I request samsung to please take a look on this because it is would be a better for Samsung brand to make a better profit and sales. And I am very greatful  for amazon because this is favouring a difficulties into opportunities for others, hats off for amazon for helping us in this pandemic and critical situations.

  It's a review after two weeks of usage. Battery life is damn good. Even after my hectic day when my old phone needed a charge this shows 50% remaining. Camera is super awesome. 64 MP  camera is true to its name. Single mode is another feather in the cap. The display is awesome and can be read in bright daylight with auto adjustable brightness. It has Knox security and samsung Max which is a VPN to protect your phone from hackers and anything wrong through the internet. The phone is zippy fast. The front camera is also capable of 4k recording . The side key touch is a bit nagging thing though because the way I hold it. The notification alsways comes up as with the slide on the lock button the notification panel opens up. Ignoring this minor glitch the phone is highly recommended for the price range it is available at and biggest of all is it is MADE IN INDIA.

  The Samsung Galaxy M31 managed to make a good impact in the budget segment thanks to its crisp AMOLED display and a big battery, which helped distinguish it from the competition. Samsung has now launched its successor, called the Galaxy M31s. The new Galaxy M31s sports an Infinity-O display and the Single Take camera feature, both firsts for the Galaxy M series. Starting at Rs. 19,499, do these new features justify the higher price? I review the Galaxy M31s to find out.spent the last five days with the Galaxy M31s, and here is my take on the phone.Samsung Galaxy M31s specifications: 6.5-inch FHD+ Super AMOLED display| Samsung Exynos 9611|6GB RAM/8GB RAM, 128GB storage, microSD support included|6000mAh battery, 25W fast charging support|32MP front camera, 64MP main camera+12MP ultra wide camera+5MP depth camera+5MP macro camera||Android 10, OneUIThe Galaxy M31s reminds me of the Galaxy A51 in terms of design language. The front of the phone has an edge-to-edge 6.5-inch AMOLED display and a small hole for the front-facing camera. Flip the phone, and you will notice the rectangular camera bump on the top left – the setup is similar to that of the Galaxy S20 series. On the left side there’s the SIM tray, while on the right, there’s a power button that doubles as a fingerprint scanner and volume rocker. On the bottom, there’s a USB-C port, a speaker and a headphone jack.I buyed for youtube channel review but it's a average good performance  experience give to me

  First usage reviews....Awesome power packed phone.Pros1. The usp of the phone is the finger print reader. Perhaps, I say it is more convenient and faster then face unlock.2. The display is excellent. You really enjoy watching videos on it.3. Battery backup is good and fast charge is brilliant.4. The OS works smoothly.Cons1. Weighs a little more.2. Samsung has given a mono speaker, which I think at this price is not fair. Stereo speakers were expected.Detailed review will be posted after few days of usage.

  Superb mobile by Samsung......Best display,camera,battery in a midrange budget.We can go for it with eyes closed.Best UI, Good processor for its budget,25w fast charging,smart switch,6000mah battery.But the worst delivery package ever.The package was not rolled by a thick sheet or by thermocoal sheet etc....Just covered with a very normal low quality courier cover without any outer package.I had ordered different products around some 25 times in Amazon till now...This time was my highest budget and the package was the cheapest and worst among all....Had little touch issue in the beginning but everything seems fine as of now.They provide big and neatly covered package for some 500rs grocery items but giving this much cheap package for 19k mobile coming from 1200kms is really disappointing.... please keep extra concern on this Amazon....

  Battery drainage issue is there in ideal condition in 1 hour battery drainage is about 5 to 6%. Processor is not heating but lags most of the time .This was the first and last time I brought samsung device. I brought only because of non-chinese device and I believe that they fooled Indian so good. Go for Nokia or any other brand non-chinese  device but believe me. Don't waste money in this crisis time. The internet speed is really slow as it does not support 4g+ it only support 4g volte which is also minus point. All in all totally unsatisfied with the device . Those who brought the phone please complaint to Samsung customer service to enable 4g+ volte as device support but in M series phone they have locked it . It can be enabled by ota update .

  Hey Guys, I Bought this phone in Amazon's Prime day sale. It was delivered within 3 days. Appreciating Amazon's Delivery Service.If you want to see the full Unboxing of this Phone, then you may visit our YouTube -> @shuttertechlearningSo here are my pros and cons for the phone:PROS:-> 6000mAh battery is mind blowing, it is giving a battery backup of average 2 days on normal use> Amoled screen is mind blowing, with a on-screen front camera> It is thin and light weight, looks similar like Samsung Note 10> Side Power button with in-built fingerprint sensor is too fastCONS:-> Although not a major cons but camera lacks in low light macro photography.> Back gradient looks awesome but you need to take a good care of it. As it gets easily scratches.Thank You !Stay Home-Stay Safe

  At the beginning i felt the battery is weak which was getting emptied at the soonest time. Later i found the inner settings of the mobile and it is running good and for me 100% charge is getting consumed for around 25-30 hours. Camera quality is really awesome and have wonderful clarity with high pixels for both rear and selfie cameras. In-built features also good when compared to other similar ranged smartphones. As per my experience and requirement, 6 GB is more than enough. So suggest to purchase 6GB rather than investing extra 2k just for 2GB more. The main reason for me to buy this is not manufactured in China and i was supposed to change the bloody China phone Redmi. But the only fault i found is network issues. Even after checked with service center guys, i am getting network issues. Even though there will be 75% coverage of network, internet doesnt work properly. Checked area network capacity tbru telecom company and it was good.Overall this phone is worthy for the 20k compared to other brands for the price. You can purchase this confidentally if you are looking for a good smartphone with best camera and battery smartphone in 20-22 k.

  The video stability needs a lot of improvement l, in this price segment these things should be more refined. Also, photos in low inditect sun light or artificial lights needs improvement  as it has noise in the images. I think this is just a image processing thing which can be imlroved with the updates. Else  I simply love ghe phone. Being  a Samsung  member for the past 10 years its been a nice experience.

  I have M30s & M31s both purchase from amazon & amazon service no doubt fast and good. But about Samsung M30s & M31s as per battery 6000MH normally it's huge, but as per my expectation not worth.  If I talk about Samsung service my both mobiles in the service center & 1in from the last 1.5 months due to no part available.  service level os Samsung is the worst and I suggest to all buyers please if your phone by-chance like display broken & any other part physical damage/any kind of damage happen, it will not be going to fix anymore due to part is not available in the market, yes mobile you can buy as much quantity you want.  Samsung is the worst.

  Using for 3 months now. Keeping everything short:-Performance: it's a smooth experience! Though I don't play games.Camera: I am in love with it.Though,The macro camera is of no use.The single take feature is of no use for meBut the HDR and AI are well optimised in this device.Vid quality is decent.Has electronic image stabilization.Display: I would have given 10 stars out of 5 if it was possible. Brilliant display with great quality! Even in direct sunlight.Supports always on display.The hole punch is quite small. And after few days it's nearly unnoticeable.Battery: if you are buying it because of 6000 mah battery, you might not be pleased.I am just getting a day out of it!Charging: just after 3 months it's taking 2.5 hrs (approx) to charge fully.I am disappointed with the charger.22 W charger is just a mental peace thing!Design: looks beautiful in hand. But a fingerprint magnet. And please use case. My one got a scratch from my finger ring.Touch screen: works even with wet fingers.Fingerprint: wet hands will not work.Even with light sweat, the fingerprint stops working.UI: I felt the UI is lot better than redmi and realmi.Add free and smooth experience.Special: it has a grip sensor which detects how you are holding the phone and adjusts it's antennas according to get the best signal.If you have this device you can check your grip sensor.Dial *#0*# and then select grip sensor.It's amazing!Conclusion:If you want brilliant camera and the best display in this price range, go for it.You will love it.But if you just want battery, I will suggest not to go with this device.

  Samsung has released M31s with updated design. Here are the pros and cons after a week of using the phone.Pro:1) The display is best in class and comparable to premium smartphones. If you use the phone in dark mode, you will love the deep black and vivid colours. It's definitely a treat to the eyes. I personally prefer AMOLEDs to high refresh LCDs. Hence Samsung has done a wonderful job here.2) The fingerprint reader is mounted on to power button. Its reachable to the thumb and extremely fast. The buttons are tactile and provide good feedback.3) I get close to two days of battery life with regular use. My usages include social media, YouTube and calls. I use two SIMs with internet always active. Even with continuous usage, it will last more than 9 hours.4) Camera quality is good during day light. Both from Regular and Ultra wide angle camera. During night, the regular camera did decent job. Photos are attached for the same. The selfie is awesome in this phone.5) I was sceptical about the performance considering the processor. But I couldn't find any lag or heating in my day to day use. I am not an avid gamer, hence I can't vouch for this processor to gamers.6) The weight distribution has been good and you won't find the phone to be bulky. It's usable by one hand too.7) Single take, reverse charging, fast charging, triple slot are all the extra features which makes the phone good.Con:The price. Even though I have no complaints about the processor for my day to day use, as they have increased the price of the phone by around 2.5k in comparison to M31 they could have gone for a more powerful processor.Conclusion:If you are a casual user who wants phone for media consumption (Good display+Battery) and don't mind the 19.5k price, you can wholeheartedly go for this. You won't regret.

  Well, I am not much of big user of phones for Games / Photos.I basically wanted to avoid Chinese phone (for reasons best known to all) and actually my earlier phone display got damaged during lockdown time (due to sanitizing).This phone as such when used for last one week, I was initially concerned on battery life as per few of earlier reviews. but to my surprise it give me proper timeline of 2 days with almost 10-12 hrs of mobile hotspot usage for my office work & calls (both audio & video). It still has some 10% battery left after almost 40 hrs of last charging. Also as mentioned it gets almost charged within 2 hrs.Rest honestly have not much tried taking any of monster shots / camera usage hence wont able to comment on that. But yes rest all usage was nice upto expectations. Finger sensor had been really good with my first thumb sensor but other hand finger sensor is not working that properly, may be i will activate it again.Yes, some of samsung pre-installed apps is bit of headache to get rid off it not used.One more thing, if as everyone says yes bit disappointed as there has been no backcover given.Samsung how much it would have taken to give one proper backcover and one earphones too. (is that too much to ask for - no earphones !! really surprised )Finally, yes it's slightly overpriced.. anything around 18K would have been better but 22k is bit 4k on higher side (would not have still not been minding it if proper backcover and earphones if had been given).Overall for me it's a good phone as for now.... hope to review further after an month usage.

  I have used this for 5 days and i these are my observations -1. If you are willing to play heavy games then go with Snapdragon smartphones.2. If you are a business user or using it with normal apps then this is a great option for you.3. The OneUI is very good i can say because it has lot of customisation and very decent to look at.4. Transparent cover is not included so you have to go for other brand cases.5. Phone is handy as it's not that big in size.6. Type C fast charger is there with two sided type C which will help you with reverse charging and can use with laptop having type c port.

  if you are looking for a Smartphone in a medium price range. Then this is the best deal. Samsung has created a very beautiful phone. It's got everything. Got my phone on Saturday, since then I just can't stop using it.It's camera is very clear and takes sharp pictures. Now me being a person who loves taking pictures,I enjoyed capturing beautiful mesmerizing shots with the camera. 64mp gives pictures a clarity like dslr. Ultra wide shot of 12 mp captures every detail and is perfect for capturing a wide shot.The best point about this phone I only had to charge it in the morning,and then I use it for the entire day- taking pictures,capturing moments, playing games like call of duty and while doing all this, I use my Boat Bluetooth Headsets connected with my handset.The battery of this phone is amazing. It really lasts long.The touch and feel of this phone is very premium like Samsung note 10 or iPhone 11.And I really like the color Mirage Blue- it's the mixture of silver and blue.Just one downtown which I found that Samsung hasn't provided any headphones with the handset.Samsung people you should add headphones as well as a good cover for the phone would also be appreciated.All in all I really am enjoying my new phone and exploring it. Just in love with it's camera. It's so amazing.One more thing with this camera you don't need any other camera apps. Samsung has included everything in the camera.

  I ordered for my sister and she is just in love with it....The only major thing is that if I would purchase this from Samsung shop I would have got the earphones and case along with it ...Eventually which is not given here....I don't understand that when everything is manufactured and packed same way then how these packages doesn't have earphones and cover....The rest color and phone is awesome camera is super good the look is classy and awesome u can flaunt your own charging is extra fast like 5-100% in 35-45 mins

  Hanging Problem.....8GB Ram Hone ke bad v phone hang krta h Even 90% Internal Storage v free h i dont play games there after it's hanging....please Don't Buy

"

  First of all great battery life. I have been using the phone for 8 days now and I need to charge it once in 36 hours only inspite of heavy usage, it takes about  100 minutes for a full change. The camera as expected is really good,  this photo was taken from a moving vehicle at almost  50kmph . The touch is butter smooth and one hand operation is a breeze . The finger print sensor works really  well and the display and colors are wonderful. Specs are best in class .All in all a great phone and i fully recommended it.

  After using one week am writing  comments on  M31s phone .This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with made in india . First time i order samsung on the first day of online launch and am happy and it is awesome.Good:-Its battery  , camara quality  and processing are too good.-Fast charging and 15w charger top with phone.-Face unlock and finger print sensor response good-6000mah battery, if you are  online whole day still battery  will drag  70% still 30% will remain.-128gb storage is pretty good. 512gb card supports.Not so good.-its not so thin , but ok-We didn't get ear phone.-phone protection cover

  It's been a month now, so far no glitch or problem in the phone except the one i.e. Wi-fii stability. It logs out of the wifii connection frequently like atleast once in an hour and needs to sign in again and again and still couldn't sign in immediately, takes time.Really hope Samsung will fix it with some software upgrade.Now about the highlights of the mobile phone:1. Finger print reader- Fab2. Battery- Excellent, I charge it once in a day, if you are a moderate user, battery would last atleast a day and a half. Thumbs up to battery too.3. Camera: Fabulous camera. No complaints.4. Display screen: The best among all the mobiles in this range.5. Touch: Very smooth and precise.6. Bluetooth connectivity: GoodMost important- Not Made in ChinaOverall loving the phone. 4 stars, 1 star down for Wi-fii stability. Please Samsung send some update on that.

  The phone is dead in the first day itself. I wonder is there any quality control in the Samsung. The phone display stopped working, and sometimes flickering a lot with green, orange lines. The phone even rings and I could be able hear the message tones as well, but screen is dead - not able to even backup anything. Worst Quality. Didn't expected this from Samsung.The phone also comes with lot of bloatware softwares, these get install automatically at the time of setup. Even if we try to skip and cancel - it is not allowing us to do so. Why should we have to live with all unwanted apps.Seems like a marketing fraud - over rated and created hype. Worst build quality.Now I am waiting for the refund.

  After used of 15 days ....Issu...1. Heating issu is big problem on this .2.you think 6000 mah means big battery and runs long but if you used then you get just 1 day battery backup moderate to high used ....like redmis 5000 mah3. 32 mp front camera not up to tha mark .4. It has not own internet speed meter ...you should download 3rd party app5. And also did not get inbult screen recording option ...Favorable.1. Back camera is awesome2. Display is also good3. Some features are impressive like power saving mode (it is differnt not like other phone),notifications on floating window types.4. Face unlock and fingerprints senser both are good5.charging time is just 2 hoursRunning is smooth ...I can say its value for money.

  browsing or any other internet  base activity  very very slow as compared  to my previous mobile (LG Q6) using  same sim  and internet plan @ same place.My friend  told  me not go for Samsung  as their  network  or internet  is very slow i thought  this old complent  may resolved  in latest  versions  but am wrong  i don't  know  what to with  this set now😒Any suggestions are welcome

"
"

  Amazing processing speed, camera quality is too good. With its clear display and sleek design, it becomes an absolute sassy buy! The color combination used at the back of this phone is perfectly balanced to give it a look, a class apart. A must buy phone in this range.Ordered my phone on 6th August, got it well before the supposed time and in a good packaging. Good work amazon team on the delivery side.Potential buyers, go for this phone without any second opinion!! You won't regret it.

"

  I have been using the Samsung M31s for a week now. The phone is worth the money you pay. The display is phenomenal. Storage and RAM is good. Camera is decent. Only thing that you will not like is processor if you play games. Or else you will really love this phone. Its not too heavy east yo hold even with case. Battery will last around 1.5 days. This phone can be used as a powerbank also. Speaker sound quality is decent. Fingerprint reader is fast and placed well (Atleast for me).When I unboxed the phone I found that the travel adapter had big scratches and looked like used one. And the Type C cable also had a slight damage. Apart from that Phone was well packed.

"

   Superb camera and battery life with 25 watt super fast charger.Disappointed with processor  which can be better to replace with Qualcomm snapdragon 765.Body of handset is well designed with color in curved shape.All over awasome experience, after 10 years I choose samsung after improvement.Hope samsung will continues move ahead for next generation demand.

"
"

  I m not that satisfied with camera quality as much I was expecting looking at the description of the product. Especially for night mode. Battery life is also running like 4500-5000mh battery. Well there is no lag or performance issues I have noticed so far. I was expecting more features in camera to get better quality image as compared to redmi phones. If you are looking for Samsung or okay to compromise bit with camera quality then go for it. In the end, camera is not too bad, only it is not up to expectations of the advertisement.

"
"

  Overall phone is good.Pros: New features and gestures added to the phone are very good.Cons:1. The processor could have been better.2. The main rear camera is a little disappointing. I tried comparing camera with old mi A3 and OnePlus 5t, I get superior photo quality in these 2 older phones and even in old mi A3 budget smartphone. The photos in Samsung m31s captured by rear camera are more whitish and not clear and detailed.Maybe Samsung could fix these camera problems with a new software update. But below 20k mid-range smartphones, the expectations are higher than budget smartphones. And these problems should overcome.

"
"

  After mob dispatch i was so happy to get it but after configuration i suffer with mob overheating. Its overheat at speaker side seems it will burn the ear..without earphone you cant talk. and vibration in back side u can also talk through back side like old chinese phonesNoise also not so clear either in earpeace mode or speaker mode..After complaint many times amazon is ready to sent a person for inspection.

  Been using Samsung galaxy phone for last 4+years. value for moneySamsung M31s is smooth in function, can switch apps with ease with no lag,  battery doesn't heat up, reasonable charging time taken which fast by any standards, thanks to 25W chargeperformance of the camera is at par. clean shot with 64 mp camera, macros are amazing, selfie camera is just great, captures details without altering the details by artistically smoothing or brightening.only con is is a bit heavy when compared to my previous phone Samsung J7 2016.classy appearance.overall good value for money!!! 5 stars

"
"

  Don't expect much out of this phone. It's an average phone. It's having hanging issue from the second week onwards. I didn't installed any game. Fingerprint reader is slow. Camera is good on the day light shots. But on low light, you can find lot of digital noise in the photos. Battery life is decent. But charging takes more than 2.5 hours (from 0 to 100%). But in description it is mentioned that it'll take 90 mins to reach 100%. WhatsApp sticker installed can't be used/available in the dual WhatsApp app. On this price range, it doesn't fullfill my expectations.

  This is a very nice smartphone . Specially it's baatery is a monster and which is get charged very quickly with 25 watt charget in the box . It's take only 2 hrs to get charged full . That's quite good .

"
"

  I was eagerly waiting for this phone. Received within promised time. I am impressed with the back camera , front camera is ok ok type. Battery life is good. One problem i faced to set up the network connection (mine is jio 4g) . You have to change some settings. Plz Watch video of it from you tube. Otherwise jio 4g will not active on this phone. Overall good. But i felt it little overpriced.

"
"

  Well had 2 times replaced the product but wasn't satisfied at all ..Full marks to the seller ...5 star.I have got m51 far betterBattery- good but heats up near camera.. 2 star.Camera 5 star.Finger reader 5 starPerformance with multiple apps .. gets heated up. 2 starFor all this latest phones getting a case is been trouble. Samsung should think about it.

"
"

  Really a good product from samsung except for the higher price. The product feel and quality has to be improved as they make it in Korea originally,since this is an Indian make compromising on quality. Hope they will improve upon quality and rightly priced in future. Otherwise good product , camera quality for average and above average users.Need for a snapdragon processor as many developers represent.

"
"

  At initial impression it's feel good but after few day it can't start from home screen and some touch issue and i went to Samsung care for that customer care representative say that it's a mother board issue in just few day , what a cheap quality use by samsung. Not happy at all 😠

  This is a very good mobile in mid range segment.Display 5/5(super amoled)Sound 5/5(dolby)(only via headphones)Battery 5/5(6000mAh)Charging5/5(25watt fast charger)Camera4/5(64mp)I consume a lot of media every day via netflix and amazon prime video.Samsung m31s comes with L1 cerfication to stream full HD content and the mobile is hdr 10 certified too.Dolby sound enhances movie experience and super amoled display is awesome.

  Bought this phone 4 days back.Pro:Punch hole display feels like samsung flagship mobiles like S seriesThough there is no mention of hdr display in product page it suppports hdr you can check it with youtube video. The display itself feels a class aboveThis is best smart phone in the price for media consumptionDolby atmos support makes the music hearing and movie watching experience via wired or wireless earphones is tremendousThe camera is than adequate for any smart phone user25 watt fast charges helps the humungous battery to charge in 1&1/2 hoursInbuilt voice recorder in this smart phone is exceptional so much so entry level podcaster can record his or her voiceCons:One thing would be dont have too much expection on tge battery life just because it says 6000mAhIf at all you are heavy multitasker or use adobe lightroom in mobile 6 GB RAM would be more than enough

  Never recommend this product. It lags too much with normal use also. Cost is very much higher, if compared quality and performance in this price range. No doubt battery life is good. But overall not satisfied with this purchase.😐Only brand is not enough, something good must be present inside product also.

  I bought samsung M31s for my wife..used for two weeks. C is using mobile for story reading and ludo king only. Earlier c used Redmi note 7 pro.1. Camera: 64MP camera is not like 64MP. It's Sony camera. But redmi note 7 pro camera is better. Front camera is good. Then video quality is good.2. Battery: 6000mah!  It's doubt.. it sucks charge very fast. Within 24 hours more than 90% charge is dried. Charging time also around 2 hours it takes. Redmi note 7 pro is better than this.3. Connectivity: it is very poor. While sending text through what's app, After 30 second only it sends text. C s using Jio sim. No signal issues also. Downloading also very slow. ( I am using moto G5 s plus, it performs better than M31s. I am also using Jio sim.)4. Performance: There is lag in performance of mobile.. it's being very slow. It uses extra storage of 6 GB RAM. Already installed apps occupies 2.5 GB. If we install other app means it occupies 4GB out of 6GB.Redmi note 7 pro performed well than this.5. Display : Very good display. No cons about display.. it has good display..6. Finger print: side finger print option is good.  But it is used only for display on, it does not switch of the display. If we put flip cover, we couldn't register thumb impression on finger print scanner.

  The phone is really good. But that doesn't mean it doesn't have its fair share of issues. The major issue i face is with the software. Rest everything works fine. Samsung keeps releasing new bugs in each of their updates. Major software issued I faced are unstable network, app freeze and  data speed issues. Sometimes even if I'm sitting right next to the wifi it shows 1 bar less. And the speed drops considerably. Speed tests indicate really fast speeds but while using the apps it doesn't work at an efficient speed. Especially apps such as YouTube,  whatsapp etc. This im guessing is a software issue. The app freeze is also a software issue.

  While writing this reviews I have already used this mobile more than 20 days .Phone is excellent specially ONEUI 2.1 is fabulous,No ads and no bloatwares.But the processor is little bit old processor, otherwise everything is fine .Go for it without any second thought .One more major point ..Now privacy is one of the biggest fundamental human rights ,which you can't get in Chinese smartphones.They are stealing our data .So nowadays for privacy you have to worry bcoz in smartphone you are carrying a lots of information regarding card information,your heartbit after a run ,your photos ,images ,banking information etc etc..

  Galaxy M31s has a nice and colourful 6.5-inch AMOLED screen, a great camera, excellent battery life, capable processor, a headphone jack and great build quality.

  Good mobile. Btw all samsung mobiles are same, no difference at all .its the same what I was expecting. I just wanted new mobile as my old phone was 1 year old , so i purchased this on exchange offer.  Dont expect much from any mobile phone.. phone is for calling, messaging and for little time paas when we r alone and not at home. At home I have PC , TV etc that i use for gaming or watching movies.. I use mobile for its main purpose only, so I am not disappointed but price is little bit higher. And same old design. Poor samsung cant make better looking mobiles. Always they make cheap plastic body. And then claminng 64 mp camera, 6 gb ram and bla bla. For taking pictures i use my nikon camera. . I just want phone simple good looking and only for normal use. They cant make 2 stereo loud speaker phone? Then cant make its look better? But they r focused on 256mp camera. And 10 cameras on 1 phone. Jokers :))

  Review after 30days of use:1. Display: Awesome super amoled display, video looks good and colours are displayed with lot of detailing.2. Battery life: Good can spent couple of days without charging.3. camera: Nice clicks from front and back camera both are good.4. Heat: I played games for long hrs and no heating detected.5. Finger print: quickly responds.6. Charger: Complete charge in around 1 1/2hr from zero percent.7. Speaker: Nice and loud. clear music.Cons:1. My eyes gets red after usage and getting little headache, not sure if due to mobile vivid display. because when i changed this to natural i am not facing such issue.Overall: Happy with the product.

  Too much of shutter lag in camera. Few lags seen in few application as well. All other things are great. At this price point a good device. They could have given a more Snapdragon chipset.Update: While playing audio with Android auto there is audio drop(kind of skip). Not sure is this is problem with Android auto or phone Bluetooth while playing music. Was using apple before and music was smooth.

  M31s is an expectation met smartphone. If I define in one word it is ""Superfluous midranger with High speed performance"". Used Samsung, Micromax, vivo phones. But the Camera I have never seen this depth, clarity and saturated color photos in any product so far. SPEAKER has a bass touch in it equaling a Stereo speaker. Its Knox protected mobile. Built quality is super premium. Mirage Blue is defines a Class Flagship premium look. Thanks for the rapid Delivery and Amazon packing was secure. A well justified price for the M31s. So what are you waiting for, order it & u will love M31s liquid LPDDR4x RAM speed & a massive 6000mAh with a INTELLI CAMERA, Samsung has really improved the camera segment in M31s.

  Best budget phone.1. Exynos haters, try to keep your data safe with SD processors. Also big brands like Samsung work on optimization which chinese brands can never. So performance is smooth.2. Pubg hangs after 2 hours even in 855 plus phones so really not worth spending more or relying on chinese brands(who start to decline after 1 year.)3. Camera, display, battery, connectivity, Knox security can't get better in this budget.I personally don't care about Samsung pay or else I would have gone for A51.

  Build-up Quality - 4.5 /5Sturdy phone,and feels premium. You van use it with one hand. Fingerprint reader works like a charm.Screen Quality - 5/5No two views about Samsung amoled screen. Punch hole makes it a class apart.Camera - 4.5/5Camera performance is decent, and very responsive. Used wide angle cam , was able to  take clear n sharp pictures. One click is an added advantage.Processor - 4/5Pubg performance was neutral ( kinda okayish) . However , opening and working on other apps was a breeze.Call quality - 4.5/5Earpiece volume is quite clear n decent. Much better than the previous brands phones that i used.Battery -5/5Perfect -  A game changer. 6000 mah n 25 w super charger is a deadly combination.Interface - 5/5UI is pretty neat, with no bloatwares/ ads.

  First of all Delivery from Amazon was pathetic. It was delivered with water on packaging n bit on phone too. When I called customer care they said can't replace it However they will pay back the amount where I have spent time n money n bought it with some coupon.Coming to phone performance its ok and can't say best.  One good thing is its very good camera featured phone with multiple n good option.

  It has been more than a month using this mobile. I was very excited when I purchased this. But its not up to the mark.Although it has 4 cameras with ""64 megapixels"" primary camera, but it is not very good.Ram management is good but processor is slow, very slow.It appears good in appearances but build quality is not good.It does not justify its price, I found very costly.

"
"

  The Samsung Galaxy M31s offers stellar value for money and is arguably the best M-series smartphone under 20k. The phone has a great primary camera, fantastic battery life, a crisp and vivid display, capable performance, and good build quality. The dedicated microSD card slot and 3.5mm headphone jack only add to the smartphone's appeal.The macro lens and ultra-wide camera are also quite average. However, these issues are not huge deal-breakers. The Galaxy M31s is a great package overall and Samsung surely has a winner on their hands.

  Review after 5 days uses.Pros:Display: very good looksvery clear in outdoor as well.Battary: easily give backup for whole day for normal user, for heavsy users it also perform good.Cons:Camera: camera is usp for this mobile but is very ordinary evan my two year old honor plus out perform it in most of cases.Processor: only good for just daily tasks it lags if you play light games like tennis clash.Body: plastic must use case and glass guard.

  1. When you change phone, you look for bigger ram and storage, better camera quality, bigger battery, and nice user interface. This phone cleared all these exams with flying colours.2. overall feel of phone and grip is good in hands. Fingerprint reader is pretty fast and there is no lag in processing. There are lot of customisation option unlike Chinese phones (I don't like those push and force advertisement in MI and other Chinese phones). I switched from ASUS and with this phone I had good experience so far. I recommend this product and brand to all. It may be seems costly in comparison Chinese phone by 500-1000 rs, but you will get support services from one of the reputed brands in india.

  After 2 week usage reviewBeautiful displayGood battery lifeCharger is sufficiently fastNo lag at all in daily uses ( i didn't use it for heavy game like pubg )Amazing rear camera undoubtedly bestFront camers is just okay type seems some software problemNet speed goodNo network problemSound - clear and loud sound in call and musicBiometrics - worst fingerprint sensor ,work sometimes very fast but sometimes it doesn't work and u have to enter pin same goes with Face lock it take more then usual time to identify youOver all good phone at this price if you want to buy a non Chinese phone this is the best option in this prise range it gives you flagship experience (for regular usage like net surfing video streaming, no idea about hardcore gaming)In my personal opinion its better then samsung A51 A71 and one plus nord it has better camera better battery ,3.5 mm jack dedicated memory card slot and then less price comparison to nord

Nice batteries,  no heating even after 1.45 hours talk over whatapp call.

  I extensively researched for a month before purchasing this mobile. I run a company and I was looking for a mobile which can be with me without any maintenance and slowing down for at least 3 years. I cannot afford to change mobile phones every year and I'm already using an iPhone 6s Plus.I was confused with this mobile, Oneplus Nord and realme 6 pro and finally purchased this mobile.Pros:1) The screen quality is Awesome. it is super AMOLED and no less than the flagship series of Samsung.2) The battery life is the second-best point of this phone. The battery lasts at least 1.5 days even with heavy usage.3) Samsun One UI is also great. There are no ads, unlike MI, Oppo and Vivo phones. It offers a lot of customizations and one the easiest to use.4) The camera is not that bad, the camera is not that good as OnePlus Nord but it is not that bad. It has an average camera.5) No Heating issues.6) It can run games easily. I won't say it is the best at handling games but if you are not a gamer, you can run any game on this mobile easily.7) The speaker is big enough.8) Audio quality is simply unmatched, it has Dolby Atmos and with earphones it is awesome.Cons:1)The biggest Con that no will tell you is - it has no Haptik feedback and also Vibration sucks.2) Fingerprint reader and face unlock is not worth it. It is really bad.2) Plastic back is very bad and you need to cover it to save it from damages.3) No earphones, Screen guard and the back cover comes with the phone. Please get the cover on the same day as there can be micro scratches on the phone.4)The phone is heavy and a bit thick.

  A pretty decent mobile on its performance,maynot be a choice for gamers but for normal use this works perfectly well.Camera with outdoor lighting is brilliant with natural color production and you can make wonders using PRO mode,need improvements in artificial lightings. Video stabalization is not that great as even minor shake cause a blurry output.Bixby vision and AR zone are too cool.Super Amoled display is a treat to watch,call quality is good,excellent battery,smart view option to mirror mobile screen is good. To conclude, M31s definately stands tall from samsung segment but if it would have been within 17k price range it would surely be one of the competative one in market.

  You won't get such an awesome phone at this price. I pray the company not to withdraw or increase price of  this phone from the market as this more than worth a flagship phonePROSSee the quality of the image of the food that's captured using M31s. There is nothing more to explain about its camera quality than this.The keyboard has built in audio to type the messages according to our voice. And this works in all apps.As far finger print is concerned its very fast. I had been using vivo z1x, IPhone 11, OPPO, etc. But the finger print speed is lightening.Also face unlock. In this phone it has an extra feature to add alternate face. Its similar to adding 2 faces or with mask or make up and without the same. Also it has an option for open eye to unlock.Among this range phones of Samsung,  it has always on display, which was lacking in samsung mid range bands. I like it too much.The look of the phone is quite like a flagship phone. We feel the built is with metal or glass and it is fantastic.The super amoled display is like liquid display. Finger flows freely.About the speaker, even the ring tone itself has a rich tone. We long for hearing music again and again.The full screen view of videos is awesome. We not even notice the camera hole in it.CONSonly three fingers can be added. If there is an option to add attract 10 fingers,  it would be even better.

"

  See in this price one cannot get everything right, so Samsung has offering for best camera, display, and battery in this price.I must say camera is one factor which is hard to master in low price, even one plus struggle to give best cam in 30k.So camera is top highlight, then the quality of display it has. Is surely amazing to this price.The ui experience is surely amazing, if you have never used one ui then it's hard for you to understand but this is best ui, with high level in customisation and top level security.Performance is also good if not awesome. In my opinion it's one of the best phone in its price. One can go with it and I am sure will not get disappointed.😀🙏

  Battery life and fast charging is excellent. Phone runs upto 2 days with single charge for me  with an average screen time of 6 hrs per day with sync, gps and mobile data turned on.  Camera is also good (especially the features like pro,  slow motion and time laps ). but sometimes I felt camera application is slow. Phone is good enough for daily usage when battery is less. I'm using more than 55 applications other than the preinstalled applications haven't noticed any difficulties in multi tasking. I have played PUBG too, but it was not that great experience because of heating issue after continuous usage.The side mount fingerprint scanner is a excellent feature especially easy when using bigger phones. But sometimes its tricky especially when ur hand is slightly wet or something as compared to the back mount ones.Camera, battery life and infinity o sAMOLED display are the features I love in this phone

"
"

  NOT A TECHNICAL BUT AN HONEST USER EXPERIENCE AS YOU HAVE TO TAKE A BOW ITS LONG LASTING BATTERY LIFE, BEST PERFORMANCE & VIVID CAMERA QUALITY RESULTSBATTERY LIFE:The previous generation samsung phone had only 1 problem i.e., of battery. This has now completely resolved. I use my personal phone same as I use my laptop. Every transaction, business work, personal stuffs name it. Still, due to heavy usage of phone, battery lasted for as much as 48 hours!!!! Can't get any better deal than this at this price.CAMERA:With a quad camera setup of 64 MP, you can snap some of the great memories with your phone. I am more into scanning the documents from a phone than taking snaps of nature and this phone has not discouraged me any way.PROCESSOR:Heavy usage of phone has not discouraged me either in processor. I am not a techno savvy guy still I can write that this phone has got nuts in performing multi-tasking.BUILD QUALITY:Corning gorilla glass and sturdy body frame of phone has not upset me either. Yes phone was drop by me mistakenly on day 1 still no crack or break.What else do you need in a 20-22k price range? Samsung Galaxy M31s is a complete all in one package!!!

  It's a wonderful phone with a great screen with super amlod display, wonderful camera and a good battery life.But processer is not impressive gud but can be better. Sometimes it will gain temperature. But can manageable.Finally we can say it's a good phone with a wonderful for Media consumption but not that gud for gaming (mainly pro. Games but same games a ok).

"

  This is awesome my last samsung device is samsung grand and after then samsung A5 but there is hanging ishue so i have leave this brand and purchase any other brand mobile phonez like vivo and oppo and real me but i see this phone samsung galaxy m31s i have thaught can i buy or not i m confusing this phone and any other brand phones because hanging problem but i decided to buy this phone in first sale zo i bought it and i m surprisded this phone is awesome display, camera and battery is mind bloing and performance is also very good it lookes premium and hand grip is very well i feel very happy to join this brand again and i m enjoying with this phone.

  Used this mobile for about 3 weeks and then writing this review.The mobile battery is very good and long lasting. Normal use for about 1-2 hours a day will only reduces its battery to 5-10% when fully charged.Camera quality is awesome.One shot mode is good for travelling but I didn't used it much.I used the 8 GB variant so mobile didn't hanged at all.Audio and video quality is very good.Mobile is bit heavy but that's not bad about that because if you chose 6000mAh battery mobile it is obvious that it becomes heavy.I think it's worth buying this product.But beware of duplicate products if the outer seal of the box is tempered please return it as soon as you got the parcel, don't wait for anything.Moreover this review is based on my personal experience, and it may vary from person to person. According to my budget it's worth of money.

  Positive thingsVery nice phone,Camera result also good,Mobile speed also good,Sound quality fantastic,Charging facility superb,In camera single take option is superbLittle thick compare to other mobile,because battery is 6000mah.,Negative things isCompany not provide back case, and not provide screen protect.

  Nice set.Pros:1.Camera in good light conditions2.Sleek design3.Superb display4.One UI 2.1 is nice but scope for improvement is there5.knox Security Api avl  phone info but its features  are not made avl now.6.Camera application is multi featured& NiceCONS1.In poor lighting  picsare slightly grainy or appears hyper edited .2.Speaker at high volume making vibrating effect  at plastic back panel3.Battery is huge but could be manage🔋 not at par its specification  but not too bad.4.Fingerprint at side is fast but click sound coming with it is noticeable .5.Exynos 9611 could have been replaced with Snapdragon6.Price slightly  high

"

   Phone has good finish, a lot better than M31.Awesome screen resolution and crystal clear sharp display.Very good camera, nice daylight photos. Have not dont much night time or low light photography yet.Very good long lasting battery backup and also the battery charges up fully within an hour from zero or 5-10%.Fingerprint reader on side is cool feature and also very responsive.All n all loved the phone and found it value for money.A lot better than other Chinese competitors.

"
"

  The very first impressions about and overall spec is good.But when go in detail and once start using it will start feeling the weakness of the phone.1. 6k mah battery still not effective as the process is not efficient.2. Frequently internet get disconnect and even the network go blank and I missed lot of calls.3. Even the same problem with Bluetooth connectivity.4. Camera 64 mp is just doesn't give any crisper photo when go on detail.Im writting this review after using this phone for a month.I really got disappointed.

"
"

  Battery life is toooo bad...drains very fast.Camera effects is the best thing which is added in this phone

"
"

  Reviewing after using 2 weeksBattery life is good.Fingerprints is quite good.Camera is not upto mark.I have to reset few times while clicking and making video. In night video quality is poor until you reset the camera setting.Tried to make video in night view while driving on xpressway but it doesn't capture the light in night. Again in reset the setting.8 gb of ram is good. But some time it freez or hang. We need to lock the device and unlock to use it again!.While playing game it become very laggy. Tried to play PUBG but too many glitch or poor performance..In last I can it only good for surfing browsing and chatting. It will good bettery life..

"
"

  Let's start with pros:Battery - My battery runs for around 48 hours with normal call flow & messages/ WhatsApp, around 1 hour of gaming, 1 hour of Amazon Prime, etc.Camera - Camera output is awesome. Single take feature is superb. It shares 1 best shot, 1 small video, 1 super fast video and 1 reverse video. Front camera is equally good.RAM & ROM - I'm using 8GB & 128GB phone & its performance is up to mark.Sound - Sound is not very extra ordinary for music lovers but when you use speaker for normal calls - it works fine. This phone also has FM radio which most of the companies are not offering now a days.The best feature is placement of finger print sensor. It's at the side of handset - right under the volume control. The placement of this sensor make its use quite handy.Let's go for cons:The only con I could find out is non-availability of a good back/ flip cover. In my view Samsung should start manufacturing the cover along with the handset and bundle it with handset for ease of it's customers.

"
"

  This is one of the best Android phones under budget.Camera quality with 64 megapixel covers wide angle photographs with really good quality. Also capability of recording 4k videos with no delays adds to the fun of making awesome videos.It has fingerprint reader and face recognition to unlock. Fingerprint gets dusty sometimes with usage, but works pretty well.The battery life is amazing. Full charge easily carries the normal phone usage to 30 hours.Overall its a very good phone under 20000.

"
"

  It is a phone which is jack of all trades master of none.Battery is goodCharging speed is goodHardware performs well for day to day tasks.Camera ain't that good.No heating issues.Just phone takes time to boot up.Net speed is slow when the phones restarts after switching off.So give two minutes after switching on and then try internet .

"
"

  Pros -1.Display is awesome one would love this.2. Camera quality is very good.3. Side Fingerprint scanner work very well but it takes 2-3 days to get used to that.4. Have some super cool features such as Blue Light Filter, Music share (Can be used only other phone has similar feature)Cons -1.Processor is very slow. Even one plus 3, 4 years old phone processor was super fast as compared to this one. Probably Ram management is not that good in this phone.2. You cannot remove some preloaded apps in this one even if you want to.3. A bit bulky and thick and after adding cover you may find it as ok ok phone.4. Had to add Nova launcher for customisation. One UI v 2.1 is not that cool if you have gone through using one plus Oxygen or Motorola stock android. One cannot change the opening of apps page from Horizontal to Vertical. Finding the app becomes a bit issues.5. Selfie images are not real and seems one has done some makeup to make them better.

  *Detailed Review *Ohkay so in am gonna start with saying in regards with people who want to buy this phone for gaming purpose.So i would recommend  that please look another phone for that because  exynoss is not made for you .Then i am gonna talk about camera.As per a phone worth 20k camera is not worth it in terms of low light images.Talking about Security so i havent received any knox along with it not sure how other people said that they got one. But this phone do have a huge amount of unwanted applications  and UI is not as great as expected  but decent.I am huge huge disappointed with battery life because its draining really fast.Like when i started writing this with usual speed i have seen 2 percent reduction in battery  and my phone doesnt even have many apps its just whatsap and insta nothing much. Still not sure why is it draining.So maybe a scam with 6000 mah branding.Design is decent but indisplay finger print scanner would be appreciated.Because side mounted is slow and dont even talk about  the face unlock.Display is massive and amazing. Sharp colors and pretty amazing display but not sure if i drop it someday then whts gonna happen because its just corning gorilla glass 3.Looks like Samsung is living in 2015.No headphones  no tempered no protection .This is wierd. I mean  customers can atleast expect something out of box insted of charger and sim ejecter tool. Like common. Atlest give us temprory sim protection  .Because it can get scratched so easily .Please Samsung think about customer a bit....Final verdict.Phone is good enough for people like me who are just gonna use social media and netflix on phone and a decent camera use.Please dont expected something else from this.

"
"

  Battery seems to be draining too fast.Not at all 6000mah feature.Camera is okOverall not very satisfied from samsung.Expectations were very high from brand Samsung.

"
"

  * Display (4.5/5) : Super AmOLED. Rating : 4.5/5 for not having higher refresh rate.* Battery and charging (5/5) : 6000mah massive battery charges at 25w in-box charger, takes around 80-90 minutes for 0-100% at phone switched off. Provides around 8 hrs of SoT.* Processors (3.5/5): Exynos 9611 (10nm, 8 cores, 4 at 2.3 GHz, 4 at 1.7 GHz). Not suitable for heavy gaming. Good for average user.Built (3/5): Plastic frame, plastic back, Corning Gorilla Glass 3 at front. Back is glossy, feels oily, and fingerprint magnet and gets scratched easily with coins, key chains in pocket. Samsung should provide backcover in box.Camera (4/5) : Sony's IMX682 noticed to be improved that from M31's Samsung sensor. Lacks details at low light and cropping.Overall good phone at this budget.

  I received my Samsung Galaxy M31s (Mirage Black / 8GB / 128 GB) on 18-Aug-20 and writing this review after 1 month of usage.Pros:1. Look wise and colour excellent 5/52. Camera 4/53. Speaker and Sound 5/54. Battery 5/55. Performance 4/5. A common man can not trace out any negative point easily as this phone fulfils all his/her need that is needed by 80-90% of people. Remaining 10-20% would fall under techie category and they would not be satisfied by having sky in their hands too.6. OS Experience 5/5Cons:1. Little bit bulky compare to other phones. But, if your look at other pros then this tiny issue gets nullify.Verdict : Overall phone is very good and value for money. Whatever we paid we got it. No regret at all. Guys if you are a Samsung fan and want to go with 20K budget around, then trust me you would not be disappointed. So, no more thinking and worry ness anymore. Go for it, order and grab it😊

  Its a great phone..looks premium, back camera has some insane quality pictures really love the camera..front facing camera is not that good..but ok...the best thing about this phone is its batteryIts charges quickly but lasts so long...I'm getting 7 hours screen on time with...47% battery left...and those asking for its processor..its not that good as snapdragon but also its not that slow or bad...its okay...you can play any game....normally....and the display is faulty i noticed it when i use it in  a totally dark room with low brightness see pictures i want a replacement.

  This is the first phone I've bought online and I am extremely happy with the service by Amazon and Samsung.BEST THINGS ABOUT THIS PHONE:> At this price range, the features that Samsung Galaxy M31s offers are top-notch.> The camera quality is quite awesome.> The battery is getting fully charged after 40-45 mins of charging.> The feel of this phone is pretty good too. It is sleek, lightweight and easy to carry.This is the best phone in this price range and I would surely recommend it.

"
"

  For smart phones in the 10 to 12k categories there is notification light...which is missing in this 20k phone...The unlock with finger on the side near the vol up and down key is a total mess...90 percent of the time it doesn't read...Even the screen touch sometimes drags i.e. it stops or doesn't capture the movement..this is a big glitch.So ...If anyone is looking for a smart phone this one is definitely not value for money...except ram and memory.

"
"

  Good quality product from Samsung camera is good  after usage it is working fine for multiple apps and gaming is decent I loved the figure print scanner and face unlock facility as it is quick as compared to 6000 mah  battery it drains faster as my expecting a more time can use normal battery for 2 days but if your using videos and gaming then don't expect  that overall a good productBetter to stand by against Chinese products

"
"

  Lots of features are missing such as secure folder, samsung pass, s bike mode, samsung pay.Even it is not supporting LTE+ Networks.Waste of money.There is no option to return the same🤐

"
"

  The phone is an all rounderPros:Camera : Single shot, slow motion and ultra slow motions are very good options.Battery : Battery comes for one full day even with heavy usage .Gaming : Game lancher is something good and can play games withmaximum graphics. COD.Cons: Some features like switching between Wifi networks automatically is mising which would have been good if received.Over all a very good phone for the price range. If you want a monstor battery, Gaming and camera go for it.

  First of all ,Beautiful display! Makes u feel as if u are using a flagship phone. Bright vivid screen! Watching movies and series on this one is an amazing experience! If content viewing is your priority ,then go for it!Battery life is awesome!Camera performance is top notch! Both front and rear cameras are brilliant. Single take feature is very helpful.Side fingerprint sensor is very practical.Processor is the only -ve aspect of this phone. Snapdragon processor would have been a killer ,but for day to day activities the Exynos 9611 is good and capable enough. U might see some lag in heavy games thats y this phone is not for gamers at all.Overall a brilliant all round phone from Samsung!

  Honest review for a Honest Samsung phone. I am writing this review after using it for a week And my verdict based on truly improved Samsung M series with my experience & tested after usage only.BUILD QUALITY.Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. My hand is small but still I found 6.5 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT.With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M31s feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.BATTERY.Main benefit of this midrange M series is it's maasive 6000mAh battery which gave me enough juice for nearly 3 days continuously. Tested.CAMERA.This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 mwgapixel with Single Take feature. Samsung gives what it advertises. Which made me to stick to Samsung brand. My usage of Camera is high & I found no complaints at all in focusing a shoot. Good color saturated. Well bright night shots. Macro shots r OSM. The depth & clarity of 64 megapixel is more developed in this M31s model. So no complaints.PROCESSOR.After using for more than half month I must say, Exynos 9611 works wonderful liquid speed when it is combined with LPDDR4X RAM technology. I have not faced any lag in PUBG or ASPHALT-9 hight end games, in medium setting which is good for battery saving. So 2.3Ghz speed accomplished. No complaints for the budget spent.SOUND QUALITY.After using for hours I found the Speaker this time Samsung made is much improved with Bass Stereo which was missing earlier. The in-ear delivers your ear the pure Dolby Atmos with clear precision and crystal clear bass effect.Fingerprint Sensor:Having integrated fingerprint sensor with power button it feels awesome and works always!!Bang for the bucks go for it. Thanks Amazon for Safe delivery.

  This phone gives a very premium feel while holding. Fingerprint reader is quick which was expected at this price point. I use this phone whole day and still can't drain the battery before sleeping, camera quality is simply awesome 😎, i didn't think it's camera will work this good in indoor lighting conditions and as you can see dynamic range is also very good, i should have taken more outdoor photos to show you the dynamic range but i don't go out much😐, but if you are making long videos phone might heatup a little if you are using any kind of cover, but don't worry, it will cool down if you put it on rest for minute or two.Phone is little on heavier side but considering massive battery it's negligible, you can get used to it😁. This phone suits my needs so, i am giving it five stars🤩.

  I have used this Mega Monstar for over a month now and if you are confused and reading this comment you will get all your answers, answered.Camera Performance:I will not get into the number but this phone camera is best in 20,000 price bracket in comparison to any other phone in this competitions. The HDR, Dynamic Range all things are captured very good. Sometimes struggle in low night but will do the job other wise.Performance:Exynos 9611 before the launch i hoped Samsung would have upgraded this processor beacuse we have seen this processor in other phones as well but they didn't.But now after using it i don't have any problem with it's performance. I only notice a lag in switching from camera to any other app and will tell you that this processor is good enough for a medium user but if you play games for more than 2hrs. you will see a few lags and then phone performance declines and other than that performance is good.Battery life:(I should tell you that charge this phone at night and then use it for the rest of the day worry free!)This phones gives me screen on time over 11hrs. a day and i use my phone for entertainment purposes like Netflix, YouTube, Prime Video's, Hotstar etc. And it's great at night i usually go to bed with 20-30% battery left.Display:I would have said the best display in 20,000 but now Realme 7 Pro also have Samoled display and Finger Frint sensor in the display which look's cool but is not as fast a Samsung Galaxy M31s. So for display there you have one phone competing with it.Phone does have HDR10 as i haved checked it.If you love to watch your content on you phone M31s should be your pick.Knox Security/Security:Phone does show Knox Security but you will not get all the features of Knox in it there are one or two features that you can use of Knox Security otherwise other features are not visible to you but knox make phone secure very much in comparison to other Chinese phones.Design:I have Mirage Black colour and phone looks very cool. Handling is also good. And other than any other M series phone this phone have a frame ( Plastic one) and glastic back basically a polycarbonate back.Final verdict:I will definitely recommend you this phone for it's Camera, Display, Battery and overall user experience. Once you start using Samsung phones and there OneUi there's no going back for sure.

  Battery life is average as it has 6000 mah but not worth it because i have already use 5000 mah max pro m2 from Asus .Battery optimisation require.Camera quality is best but it has complicated software experience.Fingerprint reader position should be under the display but side finger is also good but lack of authentication sometime.I don't want to talk about the exynos 9611 because it is a old chipset from 2018 ,processd sometimes laggy .Phone has everything all we need, but need proper update to control all the process.Showing knox security in start but there is no secure folder.Overall I can say it is a worthy smartphone to buy................4/5 ratings as per my opinion.

  I am writing this review after use of 10 days. Finger print reader response is very quick and operating is hassle free as it is fixed with power/lock key. Battery life is much better but phone consumes battery too much and hence u can expect a power of maximum for 2 days even though it has monster battery of 6000 Mah. Camera quality is just best, may it be rear camera or front one. You won't be disappointed. Its touch is smooth and having quick response. Overall the phone in this range is best but not for heavy gamers.

  It is really an awesome purchase. I loved this phone very much. Actually in this range it is best phone. Samsung has given many new features like side finger sensor and new pop up window etc. It is good weight wise also. I am totally happy with this guys and in short it is a pocket friendly mobile with new interesting features. I am writing the review after using this phone for 15 days.

"
"

  After 10 days of use I find no fault in this phone. Camera is of top class, battery lasts almost for 2 days in one full charge; it doesn't take  too long to get fully charged. It gives good feeling in hand. Initially I was hesitating to buy it after going through a few negative reviews. But I didn't  want to buy a Chinese phone so I  went for it. My advice, go for it if you want to spend Rs. 19,000. Although I bought it for Rs 17900 under a sale on Amazon.

"
"

  Must buy flagship phone at 21,500/-It took 20 days to reveive phone but received in as per estimated date.I am multimedia user so i am completely happy with the display ,finger print touch response is great and battery life and camera quality is just amazing. Its my first time i am using samsung and i have no regrets. Its classy phone. Yes little heavier side but you get awesome battery backup and feels like you actually holding something. You will need to buy cover for it as it can easily get scratches at the back panel.

"
"

  A huge upgrade for me, especially when you are replacing old Chinese Redmi 4. The quality of the display is just awesome.  And so is the overall build quality. And you get super fast charger bundled with it. The wide angle camera is also good. The only con which I noticed is that there is no back cover bundled with this package. And since it is a newly launched product, there are not much options available as of now as far as the back cover and tempered glass is concerned. The back of the phone is a fingerprint magnet.The phone delivers an everlasting experience. And I love the dedicated memory card slot.

  After 20 days of my usage  ........i  am  very disappointed with this phone  ...........it gets  hanged repeatedly..........seriously friends  please don't  choose samsung  mobiles.......please don't refer  to to YouTube videos......I am miss guideded  ........previously  i  used mi  note  4 ........I think  that  is better  than this .......the  only  best in this  is cam .....front and back ......nothing  great in the performance  .......simple users like me should go  for mi products  ........promise  beleave me

  I had searched budgetd phone (20-30 k ) for around 2 months and then decided to go with this...decisions was influenced with Indian - China movement too and canceled Nord and ordered this.I am working professional and Mideocare gamer too..1. Screen or Display - 4/52. Typing or keypad- 3/53  Camera - 3.5 / 5 ( 64 Mega is a myth )4. Gaming - Above Avergae5. Speed - Mideocare as expected from samsung processersMy biggest trouble is that it's not property supporting LTE or 4G network. Before this my 4G was working well with previous device on this it's not stable. Surprisingly it doesn't have 4G only mode under network setting hence it's  always picks up or switch to 3G only....attaching picture of network settingIf you are not bothered about cheenese products go for Snapdragon processers only..

  The best smartphone at this price range bundeled with 6000 mAh with 25 watt fast charger ( Using samsung for the first time and loving it).Fingerprint reader is fast. For me battery lives upto 24 hr. If i do my normal tasking and with heavy usage it lives long 8_10 hr. Finding Samsung's one UI core version very user freindly and addictive. Camera quality is very cool. Shoots quality of pictures with proper details and single shot feature is pretty cool. Loving superamoled display

"
"

  Likes:Amoled Screen, Battery Backup, side mounted fingerprint sensor, Rear Camera , new Camera features.Dislikes:Plastic back panel, selfie camera could've been more powerful, old processor, no preapplied screenguard or back cover out of the box.Overall the phone is good, if you are ok with the above dislikes... This phone is for moderate users who use fb,insta,YouTube etc. Not for hardcore gamers. Built quality is better than other plastic back phone of samsung.

"
"

  Its good the phone isnt bulky i was surprised by the ease of handling and the One UI 2.1 is buttery smooth the oxygen os has its pros but the ONE UI is the most secure UI. The finger print reader is fast and accurate.. the camera is good the sony sensor gets the job done. My three issue were1) Pricing2) colour3)the vintage exynos 9611For this exynos the pricing is just exhorbitant the phones is smooth tho

"
"

  👍....1) sAMOLED display2) Cam features3) Cool UI4) 6k mAh battery👎....1) costly by Rs.2000 for base model2) older Processor & Chipset compare to price3) IP rating (not offered)4) Knox missing

  I purchased this mobile on 6th August and got it delivered on 11th. Since that day I am facing battery Drainage issue. It is not like 6000mAh battery at all. It is performing like it is having 4000mAh battery. I tried for replacement but Amazon doesn't fulfill replacement orders at my given address. Then I cannot understand why the hell they delivered it to me. I don't want to return and take the return because except that battery issue I don't have anything to complain about.I bought this phone at 17k and if I return it and order it again, I need to pay extra 2.5K. Poor service by Amazon.

  I have purchased this iam a samsung lover but due battery problem i have purchased vivo v9 youth i have been using vivo for 2 years i have never had having a heating problem but in samsung from start day one facing a heating problem while when i talk and little bit slow and sometime its ganged my suggestion vivo is good.Fingerpint Also capturing properlyBattery life is ok,Camera quality ok

"
"

  The phone's performance is great. Smooth functioning. Really ultimate battery. Initially felt Slightly high cost when compared to other equivalent mobile phones in the market. But after using it for a week about, felt value for money. Barring the outdated processor and high SAR value, no cons at all. Great phone to have.

"
"

  Had been waiting for this for a long time with all the features that suits my lifestyle. The back panel color shade is truly eye capturing and what to say about the battery. Never had a phone with such battery and so many smart features that last for over 48 hrs with normal usage. Overall a beautifully designed smart #Monster from Samsung.

"
"

   Camera quality is good... don't expect like Sony, color contrast and senses working good... sufficient for this prize range... actually I was received the product yesterday and photos not captured yet... will be up load after capturing... and O notch display is really good...Finger print sensor is superb working... I was used Samsung A 50 before I bought this, in display finger lock Samsung not working as expected but this side monitoring sensor working excellent and battery life is good cause its 6000mah battery you already knows and its light weight in our hands like freely carries, videos and picture clarity is good as expected and I'm uploading video to show you... totally you will be satisfied to buy it... if any cons I will upload after usage... use the tempered glass witch has i shown you in pics, it will perfectly fit to your mbl m31s, if you want to buy 3d, 6d glass you will regret after usage cause we want pocket friendly tempered glass right?

"
"

  I shifted from MiUi to Samsung's One Ui after 5 years and I can see the difference. The Ui is quite Bulky and feels heavy with all the animations (you can reduce them altho). So the fast refresh rate while scrolling through the apps is quite visible. This is the only change I felt that I would rate among the Cons.Would Definitely recommend to anyone looking for a mobile with great camera and more importantly great On screen experience. The screen is just WOW you can't compare this with any other mobile in this price segment. So Non gamers with high battery demand here you go, this is made for you.

  I was happy as I got the phone. Used it for a week. It was all fine.  Then after slowly it started to get hanged. After a month, While I was in a call all of a sudden the screen turned black but the call was still on going. I thought it got hang. So after the call , I tried to switch off the phone, But no response other than vibrations. Then I received another call, since screen got blackout , Couldn't pick up the call. Tried to reboot the phone, nothing happened. I waited overnight. Next day morning , I tried again to do something. But nothing was happening. Thenafter by evening I took the phone to service center , They told the software trashed. They repaired and gave back in another 3 hrs.But I really can't believe that it's a 8 GB RAM and still getting hanged a lot. Soo depressed .Really don't know Is this a 8 GB processor itself. I seriously lost the trust in Amazon for buying electronic items. Please guys... Don't go for this product.

"

  Phone is overall good in aspects of display, camera ,battery ,figurer print senser and face unlock works very well , but phone shows lags and this is the only major problems,(phone is light,good looking and over all a good pice at 21500₹) features are also some what better than other m series phones.  I think for a normal user (like me) it is okey but for gamers it isn't good. This phone can only be compared with -redmi note 9 pro max ,Pico m2 pro because of its qualities...If you are a daily life worker than i will suggest buy this..(ban chinies goods)

"
"

  Touch is very slow... Application loading time is to high..Eventhough RAM is 8 gb performance is very poor..camera not having a clarity of 64mp ...Overall don't go for this m31s..

"
"

  Writing the complaints only:1.Side mounted Fingerprint scanner is small, thus detection is not as good as the rear mounted or on display Fingerprint sensors, out of 10 trials it will detects 6 times only.2.On normal usage the battery lasts bout 1.5 days & heavy 1 full day, but the mobile feels heavy.3.Colors are highly boosted, not to my choice. In some photos the shades were totaly different then the actual color.4.Samsung Keyboard doesn't provide any haptic feedback. Typing feels bad.

"

  I'm using this phone for almost last 2 months so I would say I do know a lot about its performance.IN THE BOX: You will get Your Main smartphone and Charger(with c to c cable) NO BACK Cover so I had to buy a back cover and a screen protection. They should have provided a back cover for a Rs 19500 phone.In short: Build quality (3.5/5) is good but can be better in this price Range.It's weight is less than 200gms so works for me.Screen (5/5) sAmodled of samsung is best.Camera (4/5) is pretty good.Fingerprint(3.5 or 4) sensor is good but slow and its position sometimes makes things complicated.Battery: Excellent (15 to 100 in about 60-70 min don't know the real count but should be really close)Processor: (1.5/5) worst you can get for a 19k+ smartphone.Build quality ⭐⭐⭐ / 5 Smartphone design looks premium with glastic material but in the end its a polycarbonate back you will see fingerprints marks and have to clear it regularly to make sure it won't get scratches (I do use transparent a back cover bcz I love the phone's look)Screen ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐/5 You can't compare other phone's screen with Samsung its sAmoled screen is best in the segment.Fingerprint sensor: ⭐⭐⭐/5 Its good but not as fast as other phones in the same segment. Also, being it a side fingerprint sensor and also a power key you will have some problem but it also acts as a key features of the phone also you can do some interesting things from the key so overall its very good but i would have preferred on screen fingerprint sensor.Camera: ⭐⭐⭐⭐/5 camera is also pretty good. I have uploaded camera click in 64MP and a macro shot. Same for selfie, So overall camera is good and comparable to other same segment phone.Battery: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ : If I didn't play any game the battery will go for a whole day. In fast charging it goes from 15 to 100 in about 60-75 min I think. I usually charge it before I go to sleep after switching off fast charging mode (fast charging made battery life smaller, go to youtube for more info)Processor: ⭐/5  No good. My friends SD710 and SD712 works better than this. Even my sd660 sometimes play things better than this.I don't play much games(around 1-2 hr/ week) So after 2 weeks I installed 2 games, forget about rpg I sometimes play, this phone started to stuck in a game similar to candy crush (when all bubbles burst after completion) and i do close all apps from recent before playing and it's a 19k+ smartphone- _-So overall i will give 3. 5 or ⭐⭐⭐ to this smartphone as phone is not as good as it should be in this price range.

  This phone is extremely good. I solely bought it because of its excellent Ram management and of course for its amoled screen. I'm not a huge gamer, so for everyday usage the phone performs upto the mark. Below I'll list some of its best and not so good specifications.Battery life is really good. It last a whole day with back to back usage from some light games to videos, music, heavy browsing and hours of calls. So battery is 5/5Camera quality is also quite good. Although it struggles a bit in low light but the overall output is really good. You need to use the ""Pro"" mode (if you're familiar with DSLR) to get the best out of the phone camera. Selfie camera isn't the best out there given the fact that it's 32mp. It's decent enough and intellicam is quite useful. So for camera I'd give 4/5.Ram management is the best out of the lot. Although it takes up a lot of power and ram, the switch from one app to another and back and forth is smooth and consistent. I'd rate full 5/5 for RAM.The display although amoled is a bit yellowish. You'll see the yellowish tint clearly on a full white background. And no it's not the settings. I've tried every settings out there possible but it's not the settings. It has more to do with the phone than the settings. Compare it with some other phones and you'll definitely notice the difference. But other than that, the display is very immersive. Display I'd rate 4/5.Now coming to the downside:Phone is quite heavy. I know, it has a big battery and as a result it tends to be heavy. So to each their own.The screen to body ratio is not the best out there. I'd say M31 screen to body ratio is better than M31s. It has an aspect ration of 20:9. In simple terms, it's taller but not wide enough. So some apps might not work well with that ratio.And yes, if you're ordering this phone, then bundle it with a back cover. It's a must with phones like this.Overall I'm quite happy with the phone. The pros outweighs the cons. And all phones will have its cons. So if you want to buy this phone for its pros then I'd say go for it. It's a solid phone compared to other brands. You'll really feel the difference if you compare with other phones. It's worth buying.

  The main reason for me to buy a Samsung phone is its reliability. Have been using for 3 weeks and didn't run into any issue and the performance is good. The fast charger does it job well though I didn't do any measurement. The battery is long lasting. With my low-to-moderate use, it easily lasts for 3 days I think.- I find the phone quite good looking and Inifinity-O display makes it better. It is easy to handle. The back is slippery, so a back-cover is a must.- Fingerprint sensor on the power button makes unlocking phone natural, although one wishes it was a bit smarter (e.g. turn on the screen when *pressing* the power button, instead of unlocking which can be a bit annoying).- I didn't use camera much yet, and am not a pro. So, it's hard for me to say if the quad-camera setup elevates the photography experience to the next level. Tried the single-take and liked it somewhat.- Speaker is good enough for listening to music. Didn't try the dolby experience using earphones yet.- Some of the Samsung Apps have useful features, not found in the stock Android apps I used earlier. I especially like the ability in messages app to select and delete multiple messages. Also, the useful cards and category features are good.- The Galaxy Store auto-installs some apps like MX Taka Tak, Snap Chat (not everyone wants these apps!) and tries to trick you into installing it on different occasions. But, it's not difficult to choose not to.- The phone app is integrated with an opt-in spam-protection service, Hiya, providing a (limited) alternative to TrueCaller.- In terms of connectivity, the only feature I found missing is NFC, although I have never really used it on other phones too.Overall, I am satisfied with this phone and will recommend it. My reason for buying this model (over previous M model) were: bigger battery, fingerprint sensor on the side, and better camera.

  Let's make review simpler.Pros:1. Of course, It's a beautiful Amoled display. I loved its punch hole display. Colors are vibrant and brightness is superb.2. As Compared to its predecessor Samsung improved OneUi 2.0 a lot. Its actually a good looking custom skin now with very few bloatwares. It got some very handy gestures and a beautiful Always on Display.3.  Its Battery life is great, I don't see any reason to turn off my data or to turn on battery saver mode.4. Charging speed is not as fast as oneplus or Realme but still Its charging speed is okay. I charged it from 0 to 100 percent in 93 minutes. Fully charging a 6000mah battery in 1.5 hrs is not that bad,5. Fingerprint reader is great, It works well even on  wet fingers.Cons:1. Front camera is a total disaster, back camera is just average.2. Mono speaker is loud enough for call alerts but not for media.3. Like front camera, Face id is useless, It works 2/5 times.4. No Gcam api support.5. A little pricey.Conclusion:Its a little pricey but still I'm giving it 4/5 stars because i was actually impressed with its beautiful AMOLED display, Colors are sharp and Vibrant. There are a few cons mainly related to its camera but like me you want a phone with good display, Full day battery life then go for it. I'm no gamer still PUBG and COD works well on medium settings, Camera performance is great in daylight conditions but as the sun sets its camera set down too.You can gt many better phones under 20k if you want a phone for gamiing but if your primary focus is not gaming, go for it.

  1. Monster battery was what I thought honestly thinking that I'll get a backup of 4-5 days with this 6000 mah battery but still it's decent with 1.5 days backup on regular use.2. Camera quality is good but not ""one plus"" good especially in low light settings. However, is a decent pass off3. Very handy mobile. Easy to use.4. Loved the fingerprint scanner. Amazing sensitivity.Overall a 4/5 from my side. Enjoy the mobile.It's a good bit in the budgeted mobile category for 6/8GB smartphones

"
"

  Where do I begin.....the phone has so many good things that the few major faults that it has can nearly be overlooked. The fingerprint sensor works extremely well even through a case, as for the camera,the camera is not built into the phone, the phone is built onto the camera with extremely good night mode,hyperlapse,super slow motion and extra stable video recording, what else could one want, it has some helpful features for my wellbeing like wind down(greyscales the screen),blue light filter etc. It ensures my usage does not affect my health. Overall a very good buy the only problem I have faced so far is its unusually short battery life for 6000mah out of the box, but it can be rectified but putting apps in sleep or deep sleep categories,to top it off it comes with McAfee anti-virus.

"

  After using this phone for 5 days and exploring its every side, firstly I'd like to talk about the design, it feels super premium to hold like any flagship device of Samsung.2. Talking about the display, It just outstands, The blacks are deep blacks because of the super amoled display, play any youtube video in Full HD and you'll witness an immersive experience.3. Fingerprint is super fast, no doubts there.4. The glance on samsung feature on lockscreen makes this phone interesting in a way (Not sure everybody will relate to this)5. Talking about the rear camera quality. It is just amazing, I've attached samples(Normal & Wide angle, night mode) and you can see the quality of the pictures. I'll give 5/5 for it.6. Front Camera performs really good too but in good lighting conditions only. In low lighting it struggles a bit but not too much. It will do a decent job there.7. Battery of this phone is massive. I'm a heavy user and before going to bed at night, I manage to have atleast 30 percent of battery after full day of usage which is quite good.8. Charging time is also very less. It takes around 105 minutes to full charge from 0 to 100. It takes only 20 minutes to charge it 30%. For example : If you plug in the charger at 50% battery level, it will give you 80% battery in just only 20 mins which is quite good especially if you want to leave for somewhere and you have to charge your phone in a hurry.9. Dolby atmos (earphones only), Sliding notification from fingerprint sensor, The speaker sound quality and loudness are some underrated features of this phone.10. I ordered mirage blue because black variant wasn't available but I'm in love with this colour. It is better and more attractive than the black variant. So if anyone was having a doubt regarding this or waiting for the black variant, go for the mirage blue. You won't regret.11. I can actually say for this phone that this is a 'Value for money' product.

  Awesome product from samsungMain part is this is made in India 🇮🇳 product

"
"

  Pros :Finger print is awesome.Display is good .Its really weightless in hands , even though it's 203g ,it feels like 185.Camera is good.Earphone effect is also good .Cons:This is not really the one UI , its one UI core which is a lite version , so inbuilt applock is not there , the applock provided by Samsung in their store really sucks.Its is really a stock android feel but could have included some gestures , which is a big missing in this.

"
"

  I have ordered 6GB/128GB model. Colour that I bought is blue.Display - ExcellentBuilt quality - FairBattery - ExcellentFingerprint- PoorCamera - Good (As per price range)UI - GoodProcessor - Poor (Holding the phone back)So as far as experience is concerned, the phone does stutter here and there. The camera's are good as far has the price category is concerned. Two things that are holding the phone back from becoming best midranger is built quality and processor.

  This one is my another one smartphone from samsung. Guys i want to give a honest review about Samsung Galaxy M31s with 8 GB RAM and 128 GB of internal memory:1) Battery - Massive 6000 mAH battery with 25 W Fast charging and amazing backup.2) Display - Full HD SuperAmoled infinite o display is looks amazing. And display is crispy and viewing angles are also great. Watching Movie clearity on this display feels so much good.3) Performance - Exynos works great in this device and RAM management is also nice.4) Camera - camera give best results in indoor and outdoor conditions. Captured images and video quality is best than other brands phones.5) UI - Samsung ui is best among all other brands smartphone. It's quite simple and easy to use.6) Others - Audio ouput, fingerprint sensor, face recognition works very well.CONCLUSION - I'm extremely happy with this Samsung Galaxy M31s.Guys i suggested that don't read just specification of phones. yes samsung is some costlier than chinese brands with high specs.But Samsung's phones worth the prices becuase of it's features quality.First try it after reviewed it because good things are not cheaper, it's always costly. Thank you.

  I am writing this review after using M31s for more than half month. And my verdict based on truly improved Samsung M series with my experience & tested after usage only.BUILD QUALITY.Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. My hand is small but still I found 6.5 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT.With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M31s feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.BATTERY.Main benefit of this midrange M series is it's maasive 6000mAh battery which gave me enough juice for nearly 3 days continuously. Tested.CAMERA.This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 megapixel with Single Take feature. Samsung gives what it advertises. Which made me to stick to Samsung brand. My usage of Camera is high & I found no complaints at all in focusing a shoot. Good color saturation. Well bright night shots. Macro shots r OSM. The depth & clarity of 64 megapixel is more developed in this M31s model. So no complaints.PROCESSOR.After using for more than half month I must say, Exynos 9611 works wonderful liquid speed when it is combined with LPDDR4X RAM technology. I have not faced any lag in PUBG or ASPHALT-9 hight end games, in medium setting which is good for battery saving. So 2.3Ghz speed accomplished. No complaints for the budget spent.SOUND QUALITY.After using for hours I found the Speaker this time Samsung made is much improved with Bass Stereo which was missing earlier. The in-ear delivers your ear the pure Dolby Atmos with clear precision and crystal clear bass effect.Bang for the bucks go for it, u will not regret,  I promise.

  I have been using this phone for a few months now and this is surely a great phone by Samsung. I had bought the Mirage blue variant which I should say give this phone a premium touch. The fingerprint reader just unlocks the phone with no problem at all and the reader being on the power button just makes it more easy it use and doesn't miss the finger anytime. The battery life of this phone is too good as it easily runs a day even if I keep continuously using it ( and I do rough use). The 6000mah battery has got the power surely and the 25w charger chargers the phone in just 97 minutes which is amazing. The smartphone has a Super Amoled display which no question is superb to use. The smartphone has four rear cameras: a 64MP Intelli-Cam primary camera, a 12MP ultra-wide lens, a 5MP macro lens, and a 5MP depth sensor. The front camera stands at 32MP. The cameras have a lot of functions like Live focus, AR doodle, slow motion and many more. The camera demands a praise as the photos produced are of great quality and clarity. The Single Shot function is something innovative Samsung has come up with. I had heard by some Tech reviewers that the processor should have been upgraded at this price point but I didn't seem to have any problem while using the phone. I am having fun using this phone and for sure this is a great buy for me. If you are looking for a good phone under 20k with a premium touch, great battery life and great camera quality this is the one and thumbs up(Not a chinese brand).

  Simply put, If you have an M30 /something in that or lower segments and want an upgrade under 20k, this phone is your best bet if you are not interested in buying phones from China Based Brands.* The camera is pretty decent but not the best.* Battery Backup is good* Functions Smoothly* It heated up after an hour of file transfers* Its heavy and therefore causes a lil discomfort.* Unlocks smoothly* The display is impressive

  Was very excited to purchase this model during launch time. Bought 1 for my daughter and 1 for my mother. The one for my daughter has issues. Videos are not playing properly, and the phone is hanging a lot. Visited Samsung showroom and they formatted the phone but still the performance is very poor. It was my daughters first mobile and this is very disappointing

  Pros:Super Amoled DisplayGood Enough BatterySamsung Brand Value4+1 Camera UnitCons:Exynos 9611 processorGlastic Back PanelNot so super fast chargerVery poor signal receptionSo samsung and some tech reviewers hyped this device somuch. But it doest not live upto the expectations. It has the Sony IMX sensor, but it doest not produce true colors. If i take a pic of a red color, it shows you light orange tint. I was so excited with the marketing hype and bought it. The processor utterly disappointed me. At this price range(below this in fact) other brandings are coming up with Qualcomm Snapdragon Chipset, i still dont understand why samsung imposing their own Shitset to the user. People say, it is good for daily usage, i din even ay high graphical games, u can even notice the lag while switching apps. The processor is a complete garbage.And coming to the back panel, i know they cant provide glass to maintain the weight balance, but atleast it cud have been improved. It is very prone to scratches. It feels as if ur own fingers could damage the back.The Super Amoled Display is still protected with Gorilla Glass 3 while other are using GG5. The main plus point is the display itself. Buttery smoothy(only when processor is that smoother of course).Another main problem is the signal reception, its very poor.Dont expect battery to last for 2 days as Tech People are hyping it. Its just one day battery.And it feels as if its over priced. 16k wud have been a great deal.I bought this with somuch of excitement and simply it ruined me. Ive used it for one month and sold. If you still want samsung and can afford a lil more, go for m51.

  PROS:-1. Great camera2. Good headphone output (basically the presence of Dolby Atmos , makes it a great entertainment device.)3. Humangus 6000mAH battery4. Great user experience , I think One UI is far better and optimise for this device , also for M21/31, than MIUI11/12.5. 25W fast charging , (0-100% takes almost 2h30m)6. Great Super Amoled display, great contrust, great viewing angle.CONS:-1. Bad build quality, after using 15 days back cover got scratches easily, though it looks looks batter , but I think at this price range Samsung have to gone with glass back2. Poor WIFI / CELLULAR connectivity ( LOW SAR VALUE)3. THOUGH IT RUNS SMOOTHLY WITH EXYNOS 9611 , but it is now 1 year old processor.

  I am using this phone from 4 days and its display,camera and battery are the best under 20k its better than poco x2 in everything except processor.Actually there is flickering issue while recording slow motion  video thats a small bug. You can go for it if you are not a ultimate gamer and for normal users this is the best phone under 20k

"
"

   I am updating the review after using the phone for the past 1 months Pls reconsider if you are buying this phone. I have observed 2 major problem1.Freezing apps like whats up, Google, Chrome or any other app even the built in app. Suppose we opened one page while seeing that page lock the phone and wait for 2 minutes then unlock the phone the same app/page  doesn't move or going backwards just freezes.2. The slow mo video is not at all smooth, it slightly stops intermittently...it is not a perfect smooth slowmo..there is a frame drop in the video, pls check the attached sampleRest there is nothing special in this phone...overpriced for this type of quality....i have bought Samsung phone after 12 years..still they have not learnt to produce good phones.Over all there is nothing to get amazed about this phone...poor quality.Whats the use of buying.

  I ordered the samsung 31s through amazon on 8/9/2020 and it is delivered on 13/9/2020 due busy schedule I went to chennai come back to nandigama and opened the cell on 20/9/2020 and observed the cell that in some areas touch is not functioning and I resatart the cell and working but on 22/9/2020 I observed that it is behaving as mad person and all the apps on the display moving continuously and touch completetly not working I called the customerservice of amazon on 23/9/2020 they told on 21/9/2020 return/replacement time is over and suggested to meet the service centre, I met the service centre people they told me product is defective one and again I called the customer service of amazon we will bring to the notice of higher authorities they told me in  three working days we will give some information. waiting for their information

"
"

  Pros:Best camera unit in comparison with all other phones available in this segment.Battery is extremely very good in terms of backup even in heavy usage.Elegant look and feel is awesome.Fingerprint & face recognition sensors are so fast to recognize.Security of personal data is well managed in this phone.Last but not the least it's a non chinese phone with better brand value than any chinese brand.Awesome screen with super amoled display.Cons:Processor could be upgraded to snapdragon atleast.Backcover should be in package.Earphone can be also included in this price package.Final Statement:Go for it to feel good without hitch.

"
"

  Pros : 1. Display is superb  2. Battery life is very good ,I use internet to watch YouTube contents and browsing for about 5 hours, also use it for my business purpose, I don't have separate connection,considering  this very decent battery performance3. User interface is very nice and simple4. Camera performance is good in bright sunlight and outdoor (only restricted to day light )5.Build quality is decent6.No heating issues7.Charging speed is good and charges quickly 10 -100 in max 70 minuteCons : 1.Processor,considering this price range ,very low end, (for day to day use its ok)2. Camera is good on specification and on paper but its 32 mp front facing camera very poor in low light,takes grainy pictures and very low quality  in indoor lighting,same applies to rear camera as well.

  I got my Samsung m31s on prime day order. It has a 6.5-inch super AMOLED display which is very immersive and stunning.  I am really impressed with a mobile fingerprint which is quite very fast, mobile has a 6000mah battery which gives 8hr to 9hr life with heavy calling, video playing, various applications use, and more. The image quality of the camera is good, its depth sensor and ultra-wide are amazing. I love the single take option of this phone. I am really sad that they don't give tempered glass and mobile case, in this price range all smartphone company gives this item. Samsung should give this item. If I talk about price then it should be 1000 or 1500 less than the present price. 🙂🙂

  Looks premium with minor updates according to the CURRENT technological advancements.Look good, camera good, battery good, processor definitely not so good u can feel the difference in day to day usage.Update after 7 days use....Honestly disappointed. Phone shows lag in day to day activities. Fingerprint scanner is also slow and inaccurate. U can only store 3 fingerprints. I don't game at all so can't comment on that. Battery is good, 25w fast charging is a boon. Camera is decent. Photos are good. Videos are not. Speaker of phone is Loud enough. I think i am more disappointed than impressed at 19,499rs.

  The Samsung Galaxy M31s is by far the best smartphone that Samsung has to offer. It is a marriage between the affordability and practicality of the M series with the style and flagship features of the A series. The phone comes with an exceptional Camera, monster battery which has been giving me minimum 10 hours backup with heavy usage in video calls and multitasking.  While most reviewers and gurus are condemning the use of the Exynos 9611, as a verified buyer and a multitasker with heavy productive use, I didn't  find any lag or inconsistency  in the processor.  It has excellent RAM and battery management  . The 9611 shouldn't  stop you from buying this phone as it is a complete package.  Moreover, in light of data breaches and the push for data localisation, the phone comes with KNOX hardware which is unheard of at this price.  KNOX along with the trusted name of Samsung makes this phone the must buy at this price point. It has an exceptional battery, camera,  interface  and security. I really  recommend  this phone to you.  Everything from the charger to the phone is made in India which is important  in itself.

  Its' around 15days of using phone. everything looks fine but Samsung has integrated some bloatware in its UI which will show full screen ads every time you unlock your phone, even ads are appearing during you using your phone. And worst part you can't get rid of them. Samsung must have clarified before selling that they have installed these bloatwares. I have read on internet that even Samsung's flagship phones are having these bloatware installed. VERY DISAPPOINTING MOVE FROM SAMSUNG. IT WII GIVE ADVANTAGE TO 'ONPLUS AND OPPO' OVER SAMSUNG. Till date ONEPLUS and Flagship phones of OPPO doesn't have these types of apps.

"
"

  The phone feels amazing on the hand and could visually compete with any higher end phones on the market. Everything is great but a couple of things to note:1. There is only one speaker and it is placed at the worst place possible. Right below at the right hand side corner. You will tend to cover the speaker with your thumb when you are holding it normally, which will completely block the sound.2. The indoor photos didn't produce great results. Some of the photos were shaky and focus was slightly off even with the firm hands.

  Its not working. Pls don't buy this phone. Listen carefully, Only on August 14th 2020 I bought this, but today 23.08.2020 its not working. I couldn't even switch this mobile on. Samsung Galaxy M01 mobile. Mobile is not worth. As today I came to amazon for return or replacement this cheater has closed the return window by yesterday. How cunning they are ? not even ten days its been since I have bought. This cheaters have closed it. Its not working now.  Even if I call toll free numbers no one responses.

"
"

  The phone suddenly went completely dead within 10 minutes of switching it on after receiving it. Asked for a return, but the delivery boy didn't take the return because the phone is dead! Again request a return. Waiting to see what happens now. Can not take it to any shop or dealer as it is purchased online.

"
"

  After using 4/5 days suddenly without notice, the phone shutdown automatically and I couldn't restart it. So contact with amazon for replacing it and get very quick response from their end and they book a time slot to verify it by a technician. But after few hours later I found in start up guide send by Samsung,  how to restart when it stops working or hanged( by pressing power and volume key simultaneously for seven seconds or more). The fault is from the end of Samsung company I suppose, because they should mention the process on the front page with bold letter. Most of the reviews which get 1 star facing the same problems like of mine.  After using one month I want to add some extra points which impressed me.1. Sound quality and graphics are very good.2. Smooth touch sensitivity3. Ringtones are much louder.4.Two volte nano SIM s work fine together.5.Battery backup is good. Charging time is not so lengthy.6.Any SIM can be switched off manually, that impressed me.7. 2GB ram and 32 GB storage is better option for budget friendly people.8. I faced hanging problem for one day only till now , which can be easily solved by pressing volume down key and power key simultaneously for 7 seconds or more.8. Lastly this mobile is Made in India which I like the most.  So any one can go for it. Amazon agents are really helpful which I experienced.

  Thanks Amazon for delivering the product as mentioned in the product description. It was well packed and delivered.By the way, A Special Thanks to SAMSUNG for stepping up to INDIA's needs and introducing a new Line of Phones for taking on the Chinese Incursions in Indian Mobile Phone Market.We ordered ""Samsung Galaxy M01 Core (Blue, 2GB RAM, 32GB Storage)"" and thrown away the chinese phone Salomi as it had 100 other Apps Pre-Installed without our information and heating phone and draining battery. Had a tough times using that 'Salomi' phone. Now with a GOOD / BETTER Phone from GOOD Company Samsung, happy to own this ""Little Cute Phone"".Samsung Galaxy M01 Core (Blue, 2GB RAM, 32GB Storage) -- is a small enough to keep in pockets and has all the Latest Android 10 OS with a Good Display.  -- All latest version of Apps in a lite mode which means what we need only will be loaded and given instead of ""loading all forever"" and wasting our Precious Data.-- A good Camera with Samsung Reliability is known for its Crisp Camera and Displays.What else needed in a phone. Thanks SAMSUNG for bringing a new Affordable Range with Latest Android 10 OS.Way to go SAMSUNG. Surely we INDIANS will support SAMSUNG and make it to No.1 Company by replacing the Chinese Mobile Companies in INDIA.

  Not bad....can suggest this mbl for normal users.... charging speed is very much disappointed , taking lot of time to charge up ....basic charger type not even USB cable....this suits for parents only ....not for youngsters, gamers etc.

  I am writing this review after the usage of 15 days. It is one of the worst phones Samsung has made with multiple issues. Me and my friend both purchased the same phone for our aunts and are facing the same issues. The main issue I am facing is that the phone switched off 2 days back and since then I am trying to switch it on but its leading me nowhere. Neither it is charging. Phone heats up while charging as well as in normal usage conditions. While charging the phone heats up to an extent that one may feel that it could blast. My friend also faced the phone off issue but it was resolved automatically after 2 days when he connected a fast carger to the phone. He is too facing the heating issue. His phone still switches off on its own again and again now and then... All we both are able to do is to regret on wastage of our money.

  I have recieved this phone on 14th of August 2020 and today is 24th of August 2020.So After 10 Days i am reviewing this phone because i have seen many negative reviews on amazon review portal so now my true experience is about this phone following.1:- Processor Media tek Quad core Is best because quad core take less power from battry than the octa core processor. and i purchased this phone for my mom so quad core porcessor is sufficient to my mom.2:- Battry life is good because of Quad Core Processor.3:- Ram is 2Gb that is also sufficient4:- Display as always awesome as samsung provide.5:- Mike and Speaker's quality is too good as always samsung provide.6:- Many People said in the review that the mobile is automatically swiched off and on automatically. yes i have seen this my own only one time. but its not the problem. every new phone have done this one time because of system works smoothly. and after one time switch off on things happen then never repeated till my 10 days of use this phone. so you people who is taking switch off on problem very seriously ,you should not. this is one time process when phone is new sometimes phone may swich off and on automatically. so dont panik at all for this.7:- most of the people want to replace the phone because of one time switch off on problem then i have to say one thing that your first phone is the only phone who is brand new and the replaced phone never be a new phone at all . so never replace your new phone. this is my own experience.8:- I am fully satisfied from this phone in this price of 6499.9:-This is all the reason that is why i am giving 5 star this phone.Thank U Samsung.

  Poor Quality. Phone is not functional after 2 days of use. I bought it as a spare phone and didn't use much or neither downloaded any big apps. Phone is not getting on. It has happened under 7 days of delivery and I made a return on Amazon but it's not showing any confirmation or clarity. Waste of money.

"
"

  Product is good in that budgetAnd performance is excellent

"

  The bad part of this mobile was that it lasted only half day. Next morning it did not work even after charging and trying everything possible, but what's WORST IS AMAZON RETURN PROCESS. Highly disappointed with Amazon process it took me approx 4 days and 2 hours of phone calls to get the defective product returned.

  #Very poor camera.#Battery ok but slow charging.#I got this in exchange for 3.8k ,  So , I am satisfied.# M10 was far far better.#gaming ok#worst part is camera.dont expect any nice  pics.#small screen so easy to handle.#overall 3.9star I'll give,coz you own samsung at such cost.# may be bigger M01 is better.

"

  Major issue with this phone is slow charging and quick battery draining. Look of handset is sleek and smart but charer is Normal(Non-USB). To connect with other devices like laptop, PC, you will need to purchase extra USB cable. Backside of phone get heated if using for long time like an hour or more. I was recording video on 14.08.2020 and in 15-20 minutes, phone get overheated and I stopped video recording.

  Update 16 Oct 20Samsung service is trying to push manufacturing defects as my fault. They are playing with small users. Please be careful buying any Samsung product as they are operating like a fly-by-night company.I've already spent Rs. 3,000 for a Rs. 6,000 phone without a working phone for the last 1 month.Update on 29 Sep 20.Reducing status to 1 star.The phone is increasingly giving problems.a) The screen responsiveness is getting worse.b)  The SD card is always giving error.c) Taking lots of time to load Apps.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I exchanged my Samsung On5 for Samsung M01 Core mainly because of the lack of internal memory. Good sturdy experience of On5 let me to buy this phone. I have no complaints about the hardware though many of the software have regressed from On5. Let me write them down:1. Samsung On5 running on Android 6 was more stable than current Android 10. It has rebooted atleast twice on it's own.2. Camera has no panorama and other mode which was there in On5.3. Chrome hanged twice during this period.4. SD card stopped reading once. Had to push it back again to work. Never happened in On5.5. Do Not Disturb can't be customized. Samsung On5 had it.6. Unread SMS not highlighted.Go version shouldn't mean regression. I'll be happy to discuss with the architects who would want genuine op

"
"

  I wud have given no star but unfortunately there's no such option. The mobile stops reading the sim card often on the second day of use. When tried to replace the item quoting defective product, they ask me to install an app to solve the problem and the app itself doesn't work. IT SUCKS. My money got wasted.

  It has all the basic features and the interface is quite smooth. It has support to wi-fi calling also. Overall the phone is good value for the money spent on it.

  Samsung is loting money by giving worst product I am using this phone after one month it started and stop working saying overheating if I watch movie for half an hour of video call for half an hour

"

  It's really value for money 💰🙂...The phone comes with a 5.30-inch touchscreen display with a resolution of 720x1480 pixels and an aspect ratio of 18.5:9. Samsung Galaxy M01 Core is powered by a 1.5GHz quad-core MediaTek MT6739 processor. It comes with 1GB of RAM. The Samsung Galaxy M01 Core runs Android Go Edition and is powered by a 3000mAh battery.As far as the cameras are concerned, the Samsung Galaxy M01 Core on the rear packs 8-megapixel camera. The rear camera setup has autofocus. It sports a 5-megapixel camera on the front for selfies.

  Too much lagging as like there is only 250 MB RAM.Disappointed with the slowness of the device (I have already updated the software to latest version).

"

  Nice product

"
"

  The battery 🔋 is totally worst and touch is very bad charging is also not proper.

"
"

  Samsung didn't meet my expectations this time. I had been a big fan of Samsung products and this product of theirs disappointed me. Battery gets hot while watching videos, playing games and when connected to the net. Battery drains fast. Not suitable for video calls. Although I bought a 2GB RAM version, video and voice keeps cutting in and out. Tried different networks. No earphones. Cheap looking charger. Samsung should not compromise on quality. If they cannot afford to release a budget phone, they should not. Instead, continue with their mid and high range phones.

  since day one sim slot is not properly working, some times it is showing ""insert sim"" error. Then again i have to restart the phone or reinsert the sim to connect the phone. I changed the sim card, then also same problem is continuing and it is clear that there is problem in sim slot. hence pl arrange to replace the phone at the earliest.

   I recieved this  item on 9this August, it was working fine. But just after 9 days, this  phone not  charging.  I  try  with  two  other charger. The  phone also  get  discharged. It is not  going  on. Also  if it is put for  charging,  the  charging icon  not on and  this phone  not  charging.

"
"

  It's a 2GB phone, you can't expect much, even Facebook lags while going through lots of browsing. The camera is Ok. The build is not good, you must use a rubber cover and temper protection. It has a 3000mah battery that's why discharges quickly and doesn't support fast charging which creates more problems. Overall what you can expect at such a cost?Analyze your needs before purchasing it. The phone is decent for household usage with few apps, but if you want to have multiple apps then don't go for it..

"

  Gr8 phone at the price of 6,500 from Samsung. As of now everything looks fine.

"
"

  The mobile contains  poor battery quality. 80% of charge has been drained in 3 hours with average use. Do not buy it to waste your money.Amazon will mention to return or replace product within 7 days, at the time of purchase .But in actual they will delay unnecessarily and will pass the time frame , by different protocols, as nobody can return it . Even if it is  a faulty set and there is a chance to return it.

"
"

  Everything is good as per phone price but only one thing I don’t like in this phone that is when u continues use it for 25-30 minutes it start getting heat which is not good

"
"

  This mobile is giving very poor quality of audio with breaking voice in zoom video call. I applied for return policy, but they did not accepting for return. I was shocked due to this kind of behaviour from Amazon. I will put a case through online , if they will not take return.

"
"

  Not a good phone, waste of money

"
"

  First time in life I dared to purchase a phone from Amazon. First time a Samsung phone I bought stopped working went dead within a few hours.  Later Amazon agents kept on visiting but deny to pick up the product saying it is dead.. 4 times. I kept on calling customer care in 6 or 7 calls the phone is not picked up by return agent in 15 days. Money is with Amazon. Which means Amazon is using the money. Not sure how many escalations i have to make replace the productThe product might be good but buying it from Amazon iz a pain.If you are unlucky and phone is dead you will keep begging for return. Your money will be stuck with Amazon.WORST way Amazon India treats the Customer. Better use Amazon not cheap products

"
"

  Good product.Works well and looks stylish. Ideal for thousands of people who use the internet and call features intelligently. It's non-Chinese so adds to patriotism .Very economical and absolutely value for money.Excellent service by Amazon too! Highly recommended!

"
"

  I ignored the negative reviews, especially those about receiving phones that would not turn on.  I paid the price for it.  I received a phone that never turned on- defective.  But, then the worst part was yet to come.  The wait for an inspection.  Then, the worst bit about waiting a few weeks for amazon to pick the package back.  I understand that amazon did its best in these circumstances in the COVID scenario.  I would strongly suggest that this model could be best avoided.  Samsung should seriously consider withdrawing models such as these which are a shame.

"
"

  Touch screen not working from first day of use. I requested for replace the mobile after few days delivery boy says Amazon app should have the Amazon app, the problem is I can't install the app without screen function. Still waiting Amazon to solve the problem

"
"

  Not worth 5000/- at all but perfectly worth 2800/- if ever available at this price point... LoLBasic feature handheld. Nothing much to sport or brag about. Basic functions. Smooth body and surface. Screen brightness that blinds. Crisp camera for a budget phone. All else, simply rubbish! Let your maidservant or kid play around with it instead. Haha!

"
"

  Excellent phone in low budget.Light weight phone .Good phone for old age people

"
"

  Good handset of Samsung under budget , as battery mAh is 3000 gives normal performance depends upon usage and takes time to charge too . As I bought it for my dad and it's good for elders as its comfy for use !!

"
"

  Definitely Samsung is a very good brand and we can blindly do faith on it.Phone is really good.Build quality is very good and battery life is awesome.Camera is just average bcoz we can't expect bery high quality in this price range.Sound quality is also average.Overall it is really a good deal in this price range but if we compare it with MI in this range. The. MI definitely has a lead over it.Redmi 8a dual is best substitute to this phone.

"
"

  I used may types of android mobiles I purchased this mobile for my Mother and also to test how Android GO works.Things I Like in this device:-1. Camera - When I see the feature of 8MP Primary Camera, I thought that cameras may be average in this device.  But, in real the camera clarity was awesome at the price I real didn't expect this Samsung surprised  me. Even the Front 5MP camera also chapters clear pictures.  Rear Camera has dedicated flash and surprisingly Front Camera has Screen Flash(Good See this).***Camera samples - Cell Tower, Charger and Spectacles were captured with Samsung M01 Core. Other Pictures were captured by Some other devices.2. Display - Many companies who were selling the devices at 10k even above range are still providing HD+ (720P)  screen. But, I really felt happy that we are getting excellent display with good viewing angles at 5-6k.  But, we need to note that it is TFT display, not IPS display.3. Design - Samsung is providing mate texture finish at the back, Ofcourse it is made of cheap plastic it will  definitely protect the devices from scratches.4. Operating System - This device comes with Android GO which is the lite version of Android. But, it comes with  latest  Android 10 out of the box. And Android will provided updates regularly. I bought  2GB RAM variant and installed may apps(Not much larger apps, but some general purpose  apps) I didn't find any lagging issues while using them.5. Battery - This Device comes with 3000mah battery, but I noticed that Samsung mentioned that this was  typically, which means 3000mah was not the exact rating. But, still it's ok to have that capacity in this  device. As Android GO is the lighter version it almost consumes very less battery. You watch 4-5 hours  of YouTube videos with single charge. So definitely it is more at the price.Think I didn't like:-1. Very low charger rating - Out of the box it comes with 5V - 0.7A charger (3.5W) which is very slow to charger  3000mah battery. It takes 3+ hours to full charger the device. I have 10W fast charger  with me I tried to charger with that, I was charging up but still taking 3+ hours to  charge it. So, it won't accept fast charge. As a costumer we expect at least 10W  charger at the price.2. No Face Unlock - Face Unlock feature is very common in every device now. But, this feature was missing. They  are providing PIN, PATTERN and PASSWORD options to secure your device.3. Price - Actually, this is my bad luck. when I placed the order the price of the product is 6,499/- and I paid the  full amount online. It takes 2days to reach it to me, when I received the order the product price went  down to 5,999/-.

  the best thing is it is android 10.then 1 gb ram ok but  if 2gb ram then very goodstorage is very goodcamera okdisplay size if it would5.5 inch so very good but its 5.3it is not ips lcd display it is hd+ tft displaybattery also ok for normal usageeverything is good in its price

  True Reviews,Worst phone in the world. Don’t see the YouTube reviews and buy this phone they are just lying. I wanted to give it less than one star but there was no option. I looks good in photos but is very very small phone. It lags and sticks a lot even in 2GB ram. A never buy product. Camera is freakin’ waste. They say it has 12MP camera but actually is like 2MP. The apps keep exiting themselves.And says app not responding. The WORST PHONE. Don’t buy this is my honest review. I bought it today and returned the phone on the same day it self within hours . If you wanna waste your money then invest in this phone . The packing and everything is rather soo good but phone does not function good at all.Thank You.

"
"

  Video playback as well as camera is not smooth even though it's meant to run HD videos.Tried to return the product but Amazon initiated replacement procedure by saying that particular piece is faulty, however new piece is also having same issues and I can't see replace/ return option anymore.In conclusion, the hardware is not compatible with specification. Don't go for this product and bad service from Amazon.

"
"

  So, I had purchased this set on 8/sep with much excitement but i had never expected that i have to face soo much drama for replacement / refund.phone started heating after every 2minutes use, when you visit om replacement option,  where thr actually no any replacement option , thr is option to download the app or talk to techincan , you have to explain your problem twice- thrice to them...thn they will ask you to download the app..then they will check temperature then they will arrange a techincan visit at your place , after so much of struggle. Then you will will get replacement then again same problem (may persist or maynot be)  In my case i am not satisfied with product i thought it is of Samsung brand so i cn go for it but now there is no any exchange police😔😔 but (Kamchalu type model)!!  you can invest 2k more and can go for a good model...2star...ps- such a long review but it is truthhhhhhh, now i will think twice before purchasing from amazon!!

"
"

  Product is fine but has limitations to function only in india. And it doesn't work well for my Mom cause she keeps travelling abroad frequently.Why wasn't I informed by Amazon about the restrictions that the phone can't function in other countries? There are other countries in the world too where they've been using mobile phones even before India.Misleading the customers shouldn't be the priority of Amazon

"
"

  Amazon upi, amazon scan & Pay, amazon  money  load not working on this phone  it gets version  not updated  error in play sore it shows open it called to amazon  & Samsung  customer  care but amazon says phone version  does not support  its run on anderoid lite go version so may have problem  in lite version samsung  told to visit  their service  center so dont know it will work on anderoid  10 lite go version ?

"
"

  I've been using this as my Official mobile... Apps like WhatsApp, fb lite, cricbuzz, playmusic, YouTube, Microsoft Teams, Outlook, Intelligent Hub, Hrms, Bankings apps like YONO, Paytm, gpayWith these apps it's running smoothly...A bit of lag, but for this proce range acceptable..Pros:Decent Camera at this proce rangeAverage specs at this price rangeSamsung Brand ValueAndroid Go OSSamsung skin over this OS was decentCons:Below average battery life, anyhow it lasts for a dayPathetic charging speed (more than 4hrs)Charger provided with box is 5V 1A at least 10W charger they could have added

  The mobile Samsung Galaxy M01 Core (Black, 1GB RAM, 16GB , received could not be charged, after battery was low.  Now new phone battery uncharged what do I do, Amazon delivered defective product. This is worst phone

"
"

  Loved this peice best phone at this price. Samsung always worth every penny. Needed phone for onliy class of my son and this is best.

"
"

  I bought this for my mother as her 1st android mobile and she is very happy with it. User friendly and good for 1st time users.

"
"

  It is not at all satisfying because it is not getting charged by any other android charger other than the given one and the process is soo slow.I literally expected something but the result was different soo please dont buy this product at all.It will never match your expectations. The normal android phone is better than this.But i am happy for few things the battery does not drain too fast and the volume is good,but we cant play animated games like pubg or free fire because it strucks in between.At last I am not satisfies with the product even the design is ordinary very normal one but It is better than in images😂 and the camera is not like they have shown. same problem if we move the phone it gets strucked.The quality of camera is not at all good but it is okay for old people and for normal users like who use it only for phone calls and messages

"
"

  Product  is best and  cheapest. I am using  this  mobile  phone,  phone  performance is very  good in this  price . Camera quality is  also  good. So totally mobile  phone is very cheapest.

"
"

  It's been only 9 day since i got the phone and it's already showing problem the phone is not charging and it's dead. The image quality is not matching what you r showing in tha detail. The display is also not good. Anywez i can bare that but the main problem is the phone is not taking charge. And it's dead

"
"

  Honestly I don't like the product. The screen response is very slow ,I can't even pick up the phone quickly. Battery life is very less and requires almost 3hrs for full charge. Overall it is very disappointing.  Only good thing is it supports android 10 that also does not have some features less. This was not expected from samsung, though it is a budget phone.

"
"

  Worst product never ever try to take this product... All of sudden stopped charging and not working after 12 days.... Need to replace this but no source to do... Please don't buy this kind of worst products when ppl are unable to spend much money... Try to take good reviews mobiles

"
"

   Purchased on 26 sep 20, This is second occassion my phone auto switched off and screen is dead. Previously it was so for 3 days, on fourth day it returned to life when tried swich repeatedly. To day the screen gone dead despite of good charge in the battery. Pl look into the matter as complaint window does not work in my panasonic eluga x.Pl help.

"
"

  Don't buy this mobile, it's totally waste.. Camera quality is too bad and battery backup also very slow it takes more than 3 hours to charge fully.. And battery was drained point by point suddenly in the normal usage also.. And heating issue also in this mobile.. Better go with any other brands in this budget..*Return procedure to get refund*In Amazon they say it's a electronic product we can't provide you a refund only we can able to provide you replacement only.. Just accept that they'll send one mobile service field agent to check whether the product is defective or not.. After they approved, they replace the old one and provide you a new one in that same product..In that replacement product also surely you'll face some defects so just ask for an refund directly through the options showing in that order page.. They immediately approve that and within few working days they'll provide you a refund..These kind of electronic product's first time they'll provide replacement offer and second time they'll provide direct refund..

"
"

  I foud it lightweight, good in appereance,Sound quality is very good, battery backup is too good , audio recording feature not found(exists or not) and phone getting heatup during youtube live streaming(may be may bedue to weak signal)Overall it is quality handset

"
"

  Note : for those whose mobile got switched off , press power and volume button at same time . It will be on in safe mode. Then you may restart or can work as it is . ...I purchased for my mother. Because it is small and lightweighted i thought it is perfect for my mom. Previously she had Redmi 7A but because i dont want to have any chinese phone in my home , i decided to exchange with this.Pros : So cute , so small , light weighted , less price , good speed ....cons: Battery , Battery , Battery... My 3 year old J7 2016 (3300Mah )(large screen than this) gave 1 and half day backup and this phone not give backup of single day . MY mother just use 3 to 4 hr daily . Then also My Mom got frustated . She even asked me to give her old phone back. Amazon was not returning this. I gave threat to go to consumer forum and after 2nd visit of technician they understood my problem and gave my money. I really go to consumer court if Amazon wouldnt have accepted my return . Its not about amount but the pain of feeling cheated daily which cause anger. After that i ordered for M21 and contrary to my expectation my mom was happy with large screen . M21 is Awesome . The Best thing about samsung phone is their UI . I love it . So if u r budget conscious then may consider other option but dont go for samsung in less than 10k phone. But I feel that samsung will improve its battery . But i request everyone to not buy chinese product.

"
"

  Bought this product for my aunt. She hardly use any of the app. only for phone calls  sometimes watz app video. Battery back up is not even coming half a day and charge time taking 2:30 hrs with the original charger given by samsung.  I bought this product just want to avoid ReadMI products. But not i am regretting that i purchased this mobile. Samsung needs to atlease match redmi phone quality which are available in this price range

"
"

  Mobile heated up after few mins of usage. Touch is not highly responsive. Mobile vibrates while playing audio in speaker at near full sound. Hangs few times. Display & call quality is good. Poor build quality. Product failed to meet satisfaction.

"
"

  I bought two phones M01 core , One is working fine(Shipped from Noida) for two weeks , need to see how long it goes, for the second one (Shipped from WB ) it gets switched off automatically , 1st time when it has 35% battery , need to wait until its battery drains completely, then it got charged and after two days switched off again at 75% charging, Requested for return.I see same complaint by many users .

"
"

  Phone become hot during charging and when on net connection. Photo cannot be used as contract picture.

"
"

  3 days i bought and am happy with the mobile very handy and fits in our hand and pocket easily no haeadset provided and battery charging takes long time got very good exchange offer

"
"

  Phone was running fine for the first few days. Then suddenly out of the blue it got switched off and gives no response what so ever. I have applied for a return. Thus, not recommended at all.P.S. will post an update on the return after the process is completed.Edit: after filing return a technician was appointed, who cancelled for no reason. Again it was rescheduled who visited and told that a lot of customers are complaining the same and yet the product is available. Anyway he diagnosed the problem as a manufactur detect. I got a replacement instead of a refund. The new phone arrived and came with the same problems. I agian filed for a return and this time got a refund. But I suppose I was lucky as I would have to run to the manufacturer of the problem would have occurred out of return window. A huge no for samsung products!

"
"

  My maid brought this for her daughter so she can use it for her online education. It won’t charge and stopped working after a month of use. Also it gets overheated. I saw positive reviews when I bought it.  Anyway it has warranty so will have to go to Samsung service Center and see.

"
"

  Got this for my dad, and writing a review after a months use. Great display and no bloatware. Go for the 32gb variant, value for money !

"
"

  Phone is very slow, It gets switched off suddenly. Made complaint to Amazon over the phone . I asked for return . They didn’t agree. Brand new phone with such issue. This is not for I paid this much amount . Please don’t buy . It is waste of money . I downloaded only one app, which is YouTube. I bought it because this is Samsung. I didn’t know Samsung make such bad quality product.

"
"

  Don't buy it from Amazon. They don't help customer and they deliver defective product. I am not able to charge the mobile, they infrom me to consult brand center for repair, as your return window had been closed. Initially I hadn't use the product for a week as I had to gift the product to someone else. So if u think to buy this buy it from samsung store, don't buy it from Amazon.

"
"

  I have received this on 16august 2020....now it's only 6th sep....my phone has become dead and is not charging up.....wasting of money....amazon should help us as this is a defective product and many people are facing same issues....

"
"

  This review is solely for the seller who sold a faulty phone with a huge black spot on the screen. It is so obvious that proper quality check was not done before delivery. This can happen only in case of a used phond being sold as new. Will have to think twice before ordering costly things online, especially in Amazon because as the eshop, Amazon also cannot deny responsibility for this. The headache that I am going through now to return the faulty item is a complete nightmare.

"
"

  Bought this mobile for kids study purpose. They just downloaded the whatsapp and google classroom. And after keeping it on charge for half an hour mobile is not starting at all. Not expect this kind of quality from Samsung.

"
"

  Waste product and process of Amazon. I bought it for a purpose n i found out after the product delivery that it doesnt meet my requirement now I'm dont have an option to return n buy a diff model also. Such a disappointing experience. Awful

"
"

  After 5 Days of usagePros1. 2 Days battery life2. Smooth performance3. Android go edition runs smooth4. Purchased 1 gb ram varient but runs very smooth no legs.Cons1. Charging time is of 3 hrs2. If u installed so many apps it will start legging (i have installed only whatsapp)I have gifted.this phone to my mother she is very happy with the performance.In this price segment this phone is superb.

"
"

  Hey guys ,don't purchase this moblie at all.it is not worthy to use, simply waste of your money.I purchased this phn for my mother.It claims to give 1 yr warranty , but the phn is dead within 1 1/2 months,Very awful product.I chatted with customer service abt whether this item can be replaced or not as it comes within warranty period ,but there is no coperative response as they keep on recycling u on same page.They don't even bother to call even after filing complaint.Simply waste product  , meant to throw in trash...I highly suggest don't buy ...

"
"

  M01 core is very light and handy...value for money...a little bit heat is there...but in this cost ..it is awesome...

"
"

  Mobile is a basic model smartphone .It wil be only suitable for calls , whatap ,youtube and some other basic apps....Phone got over heated and dead by using continuos youtube and games since it's have 1gb ram..After visiting service center phone came live again...If u r a basic user as old age people it is best one or else go for 2gb ram version

"
"

  I am very unsatisfied from this seller and Amazon.. I received a defective product.. It did not switch on. I made a replacement request. And the delivery agent insisted on checking the IMEI number from the phone. I reported the issue to Amazon but every time the agent arrived I would face the same issue. I am one of the loyal customers of Amazon and I did not expect such a behaviour from them. I hope this time it gets replaced.

"
"

  Samsung mobile ok processors is OLD in 2017 processorThse phone is old and use to very slow battery life and heating some timesDont by thsephone

"
"

  Unlike other Samsung handsets that I’ve been using for years, this phone is of a really poor quality. It heated up, the charger heated up too, and then the phone switched off and wouldn’t start. All within hours of opening the new handset. But Amazon has been wonderful with their delivery, repair and return service, so thankfully my refund has been initiated. I will not recommend this model to anyone.

"
"

  Its not the value for money. No C-type charger so charging is very very slow it takes 4-5hrs for 100% battery. Just putting 1000 bucks extra I should get Redmi which is better in this segment.

"
"

  I had purchased  this phone when there was big movement  against  chaines products.  I am facing several issues :1. Battery life not good2. Handset gets heated on nominal uses3. now after months uses phone gets switched off on few minutes talk.conclusion : don't waste your hard earned money in these political or corporate propoganda  like ban against chaines  product

"
"

  Superb for secondary usageBasic smartphone

"
"

  Battery backup, screen quality and camera quality is too poor. Didn't want to buy Chinese, so bought this expecting a good phone. But turned out to be so outdated quality that I felt like I'm living in 2015. Phones released during 2015 had better camera than this phone. Disappointing product from  Samsung when their competitors are offering much better quality phone at same or lower price.

"
"

  The phone stopped working after 15 days and when we took to Samsung repair they charged us money to get it fixed even though under warranty

"
"

  The phone doesn't switch On at all after the initial charging was done. Trying to get a replacement and guidelines by Amazon is not helpful at all. When the phone doesn't work, there is no way we can download an app. On chat with Amazon technician, they said only replacement is possible and that it will be done by 3rd October. .I had approached by 29th September and was told only replacement is possible and that it will be replaced on 3rd October which I am yet to receive. Should I next take this to consumer court??

"
"

  My younger sis using this phone since days and found it isnt a bad deal at all at this cost. Display ,touch response is great baterry life is just ok as prr her use and camera quality is better. My sis is happy to have made in india phone. Must buy phone at this price point. Cheerzz

"
"

  The phone get a switched off within a day of purchase and dont work ever after. I went for the brand name. But I feel I should have gone for MI phone instead of this. This was a gift for my mother.  Such a disappointment and embarrassment. Now Amazon is not very helpful in returning. They need picture of the phone. I think they assumed people has spare phones lying around to take photo for their defective product. Amazon please act as per your brand name at least.

"
"

  Bought this phone for my father (who used to be a feature phone user till now).. A great phone for feature-to-android phone switchers! A value for money phone. It completely satisfy all the basic requirements of a smartphone! GO FOR IT!

"
"

  Device received yesterday afternoon and it was charged to 95’%. Yesterday night it got switched off automatically and not working. Reported this to Amazon customer technical service. They have stated that no stock is available to give replacement immediately and to wait for 48 hrs. Bad experience!!!

"
"

  I buy this for my father basic use. It's nice product, you can't except more in this price. Very light weight, looks good, only I feel according to 2GB RAM it's bit slow. Rest all good. Just last I want to tell there is no Fingerprint lock, face lock, no type C charging, no fast charging. Take 4 hours to complete full charging from 10% to 100%.

"
"

  Don't buy this phone...this is the worst phone i have ever used. I have faced a issue of not charging ( Mobile got switched off and not charging ) after 3 working days. i asked to  amazon customer care  for refund....but there is no refund for this product they replaced the mobile. While using the new phone exactly after 3 days again the same problem began. Even after having the 80% of charging mobile got switched off and not started and not showing any type of indication while charging.

"
"

  For senior citizens this smart phone is sufficient, who don't want unnecessary apps, games etc.With minimal apps for banking and WhatsApp and some more apps this Samsung mobile is more than enough.

"

  nothing to dislike  good phone

  Very nice product..... I, m very happy samsungm01core. Many beautiful products at low prices. The set is very beautiful and quick.  Personally, I like it very much.❤️😍💐👌🎵

  If you are looking for a smartphone nearby 5000 Rs than this is the One, The samsung Galaxy M01 core. All the features are more than the value of smartphone itself. With 3000 mah battery you can go all day without any extra charge needed. Camera quality also awesome within this range.  Also the design of phone is stunning. Cant even imagin such a low budget smartphone with all this beautiful features. Definitely Samsung alway makes its customers happy. All samsung products are No.1

"
"

  I bought it for my Mom.Pros:- Good Hardware can withstand for years and also looking good- Pretty good camera for the price Rs.5500.- Good loudspeaker.Cons :- Charging dead slow really dead slow.- Lots of bloatware apps , i recommended you to uninstall the bloatware apps the moment you switched on the handset and if not then atleast disable the apps.- Heats a lot even for minimum usage .

"
"

  Its a good product within its price range  battery life is good can standby for 4days with minimalistic usage camera is not that clear but it serves its purpose. Though it consists of 1gb ram it never hanged for me(i never did gaming on it). Overall its a good product at 5.5k range

  After ysing it for 2 weeksPros:Camera quality is good for this price range.Screen quality is also good.4G Download & Upload speed is fine.Battery back is ok.Cons:It is Android Go version.The mobile heats up quickly after 5 mins of video chat in whats app in a good network area.The system is slow inspite of having 2 Gb Ram in Androis Go version.

  This smartphone from Samsung is really good for doin' basic task for every day use, and that's the important thing for which I bought this, it was just for RS.5999. For those who want a device just for doing simple basic task can have this. But the only disappointment for me with the device is, they could have optimized the UI just a lil' bit and the battery life is not that good, also for those who dont know this device is powered by Android 10 GO edition.

  Worst mobile ever, worst service by amazon, no return no replacement, mobile is over heated while using time, and talking time, bt amazon was not ready to replacement, they told me above 40 degree heated then only replaced, very disappointed, I promptly told u after 6 days using it's not a mobile it's a iron box dont go this,I was replaced it, bt sadly second mobile also lot of heated while calling time, n using time, worst experience wd Amazon n Samsung

"

  I bought it for my father.The battery life sucks.Requires 2.5 to 3 hrs to charge and a very little time to discharge,Delivered on 29 Oct 2020I tried to return the product after 2 days use , in the return option it was written eligible through 6 Oct .Then I opened the app and there was no return option available.Then I called the customer care , they said they can't do anything...The customer service is too bad ,

"
"

  If you want a good performance never buy this phone...This is not for a college going student...this phone has 3000 mah battery but it feels like it has 1900 mah battery...it takes almost 5 hours to full charge from 0 to 100% ...this mobile is best for elders like dad and mom who has basic knowledge about smartphone...i never suggest you to buy this phone...

"
"

  power button is not working, i ordered this to gift someone, poor response from amazon, tried to apply return request, unable to proceed... poor response from amazon, when i opened the box, phone was in android recovery mode due to power button issue... very much disappointed...

"
"

  Excelent phone for my father in law. I have bought this phone for my father in law as he needs phone which should be small and handy and very lightweight in hand and Major issue with this phone is slow charging and quick battery draining. and one more thing I don’t like in this phone that is when u continues use it for 25-30 minutes it start getting heat which is not good.

"
"

  An perfect phone for someone with moderate budjet and basic needs on a phone.A quality product from Samsung.Display and camera quality are good for the price range.

"
"

  Advantages of this mobile1. No blot applications2. Battery life 37 hours but battery saver mode enhanced up to 125 hours.3. We can transfer installed applications to SD cards4. We can install Candy crush type gameWe can't expect best photo from Rs. 5500-6500 range mobile camera

"
"

  It's a very nice phone in this price only the problem is of the battery it charges slowly.

"
"

  After one month of usage I cannot found any big problem. But I cannot assure anybody that it will last long eventhough I hope it will. One small disadvantage which I found was that, if you use mobile data the battery will drain somewhat quickly. Overall it is a good budget phone.

"
"

  No product support and replacement window is working. I purchased M31 and M01 phone in same week but both were defective. Not recommended Samsung to buy at all.15th September, I received this phone in packed condition an on 23rd sep, I am unable to switch on the set. I have gifted this set to my grand father. Till 22nd night, phone was working fine and on 23rd morning  I am unable to switch on.

"
"

  Unbelievably pathetic product as I ordered one and the phone kept hanging and the charging was not happening so i requested for a change of the phone and today i got a new phone delivered and the same problem is still there as its been more than one hour of charging the phone and the phone is charged by only 15 percent , i will not recommend this product even if this is a real or fake product from samaung I don’t know

"
"

  Very much dissatisfied with product.And moreover if you have still thousands of problems, Amazon will give thousands reasons to prove that they will not refund the money. They will replace everytime and you will end up getting the same product again and again.And Samsung making such products is really disheartening.From a lover of Samsung brand.

"
"

  Value for money is not up to the mark as if you pay just ₹1900 more, you can get way more features like better performance, camera, screen quality & size, battery life with the M01.But for a beginner who uses only Facebook , Whatsapp, YouTube... this would be the one.Sound is good for the price! Camera is the worst but gets the job done.

"
"

  I love it, low price. Only issue is it takes time to charge but its good for whole day with full charge.

"
"

  Worst model. Mobile dead after using for 25 minutes after full 1 charge cycle. Please don't buy this mobile, go for m01 but not this one. But, I got full refund from amazon. Good service from amazon customer care.

"
"

  I bought this phone for my wife and she finds it very compact and convenient to use. The battery has long life so frequent charging is not require. Camera quality is good for normal photography. Screen quality is really very good. You can enjoy watching  videos with amazing quality. Really value for money.

"
"

  The keyboard is very small. It has Samsung keyboard as well as Google keyboard both are too small. Even after increasing the size didn't help. Need to install third party app. The UI is the worst thing with this phone. The icon size is too small for our naked eyes to see clearly. Often i end up clicking another app while i suppose to click another. Also there is no option to increase the size

"
"

  Waste of money and timeLow qualityNo return option availableBad experience from Amazon. No proper response and return policy

"
"

  since beginning it is giving problem. In between the call message is prompted "" NO SIM"" and get disconnected. Been calling samsung but no solution to the problem. Will not recommend it to anyone.

"
"

  Amazing and affordable

"
"

  Unluckily the Samsung Galaxy M01 started overheating and went off after 5 or 6 days of working fine. But Amazon provided a Technician support and again it worked fine for next 3 days. Then episode of switching off happened again and Amazon promised another Technician support.Looking for a better closure of the issue. Will share the feedback here post completion.

"
"

  Best for daily use and not so heavy work...Quad core with 2GB ram is fine...*Not a heavy gaming device!Camera n screen resolution are best for this handset!Applications are optimized and some are of lite version... which is why device don't lag...Samsung is brand name for genuineness!Amazon deals are fabulous...!

"
"

  This phone has so many issue since the first day I bought this.It keeps getting switched off on its own and their is no support from amazon technicians as they give false output and closed the case multiple times. Totally disappointed with this product and was hoping for some better services from Samsung and amazon but seems I have to keep going to their center for its repair.

"
"

  I purchased the phone for my father. This is a budget friendly phone for sure. In my case the usage is minimum as my father is using the same. By this time I didn't find any big cons for the phone. The battery life is decent and the camera is ok. As per my experience this is a best phone for elders in the family and also to people who has a minimal usage of a smart phone.

"
"

  Quite impressive look good finishing or light weight allover goid quality with new features .

"
"

  Bought today, Phone has many issues :Performance is very slow, hanging issues, heating is another one.The screen size very small, the display is not good. Sound and cameras are the worst part of this phone.Is there anything else left on any phone? Yes, battery. I don't know about battery backup but I am sure. It will not be great.

"
"

  Very bad product. Please don't buy. Heating problem is normal. Charger also have heating problem. Wast of money.  Purchased for my mother and now wasting my time and money on this. Pethetic

"
"

  Good phone for beginners. I bought it as gift for my grandmother and she's starting to learn the android phone with this one. Nice average built phone for below moderate users.

"
"

  Waste of hard earned money. Poor service by AmazonTotally useless mobile . Poor battery performance and hangs a lot . When I called to customer care to return it they were asking to install app the phone was not even working to install it and they denied the return lost my money on totally crap product

"
"

  Phone getting Heated in all time ... batter life was worst thing ... what the specification given by amazon is not there ... i am not at all satisfied ... No Refund also available ... WASTE OF MONEY

"
"

  Battery life is less, camera clearty is normal and portait mode is absent, call hearing is not audible we have to open speaker, do not support high quality  videos, old model and less screen for usage and processor is very less and slow

"
"

  I liked it because i needed small anroid phone for calls only and net

"
"

  BATTERY LIFE GOODCAMERA QUALITY OKAY FOR SELFIESOVERALL ITS A NICE BUYBUT ITS NOT MEANT FOR APP HOARDERS OR PUBG PLAYING AS IT HEATS UP THE PHONE.FOR AVERAGE USE SUCH AS ONLINE CLASS MEETING STUDIES AND LIGHT APPS AND GAMES ITS AMONG THE BEST PURCHASES AND THIS REVIEW IS AFTER 8 DAYS OF PURCHASE OF PRODUCTIF ANY ISSUE I WILL UPDATE.

"
"

  After 1month of usage:Battery suddenly drops from 100% to 40%, heating issue while in call. I will Not recommend this phone. Just Go for midrange mobiles above 8000rs.

"
"

  Product is very bad because it has very short battery backup. Charging time is very  long. It takes longer than usual. Camera quality is very poor. Amazon service is very bad after complaint about product they didn't solve problem.

"
"

  I use this phone as basic. But this phone hang at every touch.Camera quality is clear.Value of money is also cheap.Battery don't last for full day. Without use last for 10 hrs. Using Internet last for 4hrs only.

"
"

  I am getting over heat from this mobile. Want to return but no return option was there . I have raise a complaint to technician he has give some procedure to reset . After doing the reset also experienced the same heat issue .

"
"

  After using 2 days, phone was suddenly  gone off Inspite of half battery percentage..Went to samusung  service they made it on  later again using 2 days it was again gone sudden off,First time bad experience from SAMSUNG products..Don't go for this Miseries cheap phone..It needed to be replaced as defect device manufactured.

"
"

  Bought this phone 2 weeks back. But facing a lot of problems. I was talking on the phone with 60% charge and suddenly the phone went blank and we couldn't switch it on for 2 days.Yesterday I was on call and after talking I couldn't cut the call. After trying a lot I switched it off and on againDisappointed

"
"

  The return period is over yesterday, where to contact. Then I contacted the Samsung customer care. They told to went for service center. The problem is software update. Without software update my phone not turned on. After the service person updated the software the phone got ON ed. This one is new for me, without update the phone not switch on.

"
"

  I have received the phone but didn’t work after 5 th day, didn’t start up. I believe Samsung is very good brand it should not go useless in few days. Tried to return but it’s hard process through amazon.in especially when you are out of country and ordering for parents or relatives through India account. I will not recommend anyone to buy this.

"
"

  Not sure why Phone is over heating from the first use itself. Earlier I have used 1GB ram phones. However, I feel this phone is little slow. Camera and screen quality is Good. Only issue is heating and slow.

"
"

  Yesterday  i received  my phone  by Amazon  i just stated used it today  while using  internat phone  getting  hotter... i called  Amazon  care they said download  blancoo app and can find temperature ..i fear mobile  can blast with in 7 days i will return it if problems  continue..thanks

"
"

  This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand manufactured in India.Long lasting battery life (3000mAh)Phone has 8 megapixel rear camera and has a 5 megapixel camera for selfieHandy phone with a Display size 5.3Overall worth for the money, without second taught you can go for this phone.

"
"

  This mobile is perfect for low budget buyers and also there are many interesting features which everyone absolutely like it. This mobile is price worthy.I am using this device for 2 weeks and it's running very smoothly but remember it's not for high quality games. Over all it's best mobile under Rs.10000

"
"

  Phone look is classy, battery backup a-one. camera front and back is average. there is big problem in hand set that is heating problem  while using without wifi or with wifi. that is big weakness of this phone.

"
"

  I purchased this phone but I didn't like,I talked to customer care for return but there is no any option for return,First time I got major drawback of Amazon if purchased mobile any how you have to use it either you like or not, Dump for me,Just I waste 6399 rupeese.Thanks for fast delivery...

"
"

  WORST QUALITY.WAS DEAD IN TWO WEEKS.I SUGGEST YOU SEARCH FOR BETTER CHEAPER CHINESE PRODUCTS THAN THIS SAMSUNG ENTRY LEVEL GARBAGE.

"
"

  Today I purchased Samsung M01 core easy hand comfortable ,slim nice lookBut  toch screen quality not satisfied left side top touch not working  properlyDear Samsung you please maintain your reputaion in your mobile platform because of big aduience with your side,dont lose your  single supporters from your side

"
"

  Compromises a lot on Battery, you can literally see each percentage gradually failing towards Zero! Overall a Good Package for someone looking for Basic Experience. Cameras are Good. Screen looks fabulous for the price point! Android Go version don't let you do a lot of things, and I mean it.

"
"

  Very fast  delivery from Amazon, Its Good looking phone for normal user and low price, Normal camera result and battery backup is not so good, Only one day for normal use. Overall good for routine use everyday, Don't expect much in this price. Thank you Samsung, Thank you Amazon.

"
"

  Just wow.....and I gifted to my mom ...she just loved it 😊tqq samsung❤️..not for education purpose just used to see YouTube videos and video calls for elder ones..battery life is good but camera quality is not bad but for my mom camera is not all useful ..she just watch news in phone.finally she loved it..u can buy to ur parents😊

"
"

  Bought this product on 16-09-2020 , after using 17 days the phone is not working, not start. return window has been closed. many times trying contact to customer  service. Got a single reply return and exchange window has been closed.please don't buy.

"
"

  It's brilliant. 100% value for money. Great battery life, awesome camera quality, and vibrant screen colours as seen in the image. The back panel is so beautiful and different than every other phone that you would feel bad to cover it up!Strong and sturdy as well, the M01 Core does it's job at the price it's tagged in.

"
"

  Poor quality no return performance is too bad

"
"

  It's horrible. Got switched off on its own just 4 days. Shocked after buying from Amazon. Horrible seller product. Have asked for a tech visit. Amazon it's our hard earned Mone kindly refund.

"
"

  waste product, not getting/picking battery charge... thinking to throw on sellers head for providing such bad quality handset

"
"

  Right choice for only general users.. battery life is perfect as this segment.. camera quality as this range is being best..

"
"

  Manufacturing defectNeed to replace

"
"

  Pathetic Heating issue SAMSUNG will become Next NOKIA I buyed SAMSUNG M01 Also same Heating Issue With Love with Amazon

"
"

  It has a bit heating issues but over all at this price it is a good dealBest for elderly people or people with less usage of cell phone

"
"

  Low cost less featureValue of price is satisfiedPhone recommend for people who want upgrade to smart phone from keypad phone with very less use-ageSound quality is lowTouch screen sense is okFrom internal gb for storage is occupied by pre-installed app 50% apps are useful from pre-installed

"
"

  This phone is not good. It is getting hot very quickly. Even after talking 10 minutes it will become very hot and the battery life is also not good. The phone will be switched off automatically after gei hot. Overall I am not satisfied with this. Total waste of money. So please don't buy this phone anyone.

"
"

  The delivered phone was not functioning Properly, frequently get switched off planning for replacement.The replaced one is in good condition and working good.Suitable for elders those who need a simple phone for calling and social medias.

"
"

  Within one day of use the phone randomly switched off. I tried to charge it and pressed the pwer key but there was no response. After a few tries i figured it out. This phone switches off randomly and can only be switched on by pressing volume key and power key simultaneously.

"
"

  I give zero start to this phone and also to amazon for not replacing this. Very disappointing, waste of money. Now I decided to didn't shop anymore from Amazon ..

"
"

  Totally waste of money..I purchased Samsung M01 core Mobile on 17 August 2020, today ( 17/9/2020) mobile is dead. mobile switched off automatically.Mobile is not working any other functions like format and Boot..So don't buy this product please. my money is wasted..😢

"
"

  I have gifted this Phone to Mr.Imran Ali Shamsi at Rampur -UP.He has received. He told me that it held up too much.Please advise someine to Contact Him on Tel- No-92590 64396  and resolve the matter.If Phone is defective, please arrange replacement.

"
"

  Worst product ever got. Mobile is not turning on now. I can’t able to return.

"
"

  Please do not buy this phone as its battery or some software is faulty right from the beginning. After not even a week's use a message comes up saying that the battery is overheating and then the phone gets switched off.

"
"

  Camera quality is nice in this budget and Battery life is good for normal user I don't recommend it to heavy users because Processor is normal and good in this price .Screen quality is TFT LCD which is nice ,Overall this is the best smartphone in this budget.

"
"

  Good phone in this price range.And it isn't made in China,so extra points for that.Like other reviewers have mentioned,this phone shuts down, in the first day,just force reboot it and it won't give any problems afterwards.

"
"

  In product description handset is available with phone is written but it is not there in product.Wrong Information is being provided by Amazon.

"
"

  Product is good but some software are not working as zoom app.... Cell has over heating issues while talking or watching videos or charging... Suggest not to get this mob if u ve another option

"
"

  Very poor battery phone is heating while using it for 5minutes poor performance poor quality Product please don't buy it waste of money and time

"
"

  Value for money can't say much but according to brand it can be a OKAY deal. Small size and dum processing speed. You can get better device at this price of any other brand. Samsung can do better

"
"

   Amazing mobile phone from the Samsung company which is available in very low price designed with features which can be easily accessed by anyone (older adults) this product is best for our parents. Thank you samsung for such a great product

"
"

  The product is damn too good. It offers a good display with a decent battery life. I actually bought it for regular usage and a little bit of gaming which it carries out quite well. I am very much satisfied with this product..Thank you SamsungYou nailed it..

"
"

  After one and half month it's batter charging stopped , when i connected to phone not  showing charging , when make phone switch off and then it's showing charging but some time not showing ,Bad product

"
"

  phone is poor performance...slow , screen touch also not good..better not to go for this option even of you have budget constraints.very disappointed and no help from Amzon..no replacement request accepted even phone issie reported withinh 5 days of arrival

"
"

  Do not buy, waste of money.Phone is heating, charging takes lot of time, network loses automalically , go for a better one ""Samsung"" losses it's quality here !

"
"

  I bought this mobile for my daughter online class on zoom.But this mobile is not supporting zoom ap.Incoming voice problem.I found this problem today and make up my mind to return this mobile but I found that amazon had closed the return door today.bad luck.no use of new mobile.

"
"

  I am very happy that i bought a new phone in my budget .About this phone . The phone is very good looking and very smooth .Little bit lagging problem otherwise its all okThanksParshant kumar

"
"

  Worst product after using one hour, the phone got dead and in the beginning unable to read the sim. Simply disappointed. If the same issue raised by so many customers, why amazon selling such defective products, without resolving such issues.

"
"

  I bought 2 same phone, one got dead and one very slow and heating problem, then i try to get it return from Amazon at 9th sep 20, but 14 th no one came for take it back, nor i get any call from Amazon,Kindly return both phonesQuality of phones are poorHighly disappointed

"
"

  Really superb smartphone at 6499 I gifted this smart phone to my mom she is very happy it is very reasonable price and very light weight mobile battery packup is good 5star rating and camera is good over all mobile is very good and nice... I really love it.... Thank you samsung and amazon

"
"

  I bought this product on 14th september.On 25th september my phone automatically gets switch off and never opened.i cant able to open the phone and it does not work.What can i do now.I bought this phone in my pocket money which i collected like a bird.please do somthing

"
"

  To be honest.. This phone is meant for parents. I got this for my granny she was happy it's good for people who don't use phone much. It will not be durable for teenagers and people who live on phone a lot.... But a samsung phone @5k is too good.... Received on time... Thank you Amazon.

"
"

  The battery life is not good and the time taken to charge battery is very high. Moreover phone is getting turned off again and again and do not switch on easily.

"
"

   Last night i kept my phone for charging... But then today when I woke up i was trying to switch it on... But it was not switching on... Can you please help me with this problem as soon as possible... Please can u help me with this problem

"
"

  My dear friends don't buy it. It's cheating.. Mobile hanging is very often cannot call also.. Better buy a cheap less than 1k... Don't go for it.. Anyhow I returned it with lot of fight with amazon..

"
"

  I ordered this phone, but just one month only working, suddenly ph is not working . I don’t know what is that problem.

"
"

  I just purchased the phone on amazon .in a few weeks ago , but unfortunately it suddenly turned off and won't start again. After charging it for several times its just not working . I  bought the phone for Rs. 4999/  and the amount of money is really precious to me .

"
"

  After long time very compact smart device by samsungEntry level mobile user best buying chooseCamera averageBattery life more than one day usageScreen quality above average

"
"

  Processor is so slow that does not even support zoom without lag.  Front camera video quality very dark in normal light room.  Battery drains very fast in light uses. Colour reproduction of the screen is not so good. At the price point of 6499 this product is wastage of money.

"
"

  I think this phone is perfect for general useIt has good battery backup,Comes out of the box Android 10 based on Android one program no bloatware and very smooth UI.The thickness of the phone is very good no need of back cover because of the texture.

"
"

  if you want to gift a phone to ur parents then this is best phone. Battery stays i think easily for a day without heavy usage. but u cant play high end games like cod or pubg in this. and if you are going to buy it then buy the 2gb variant

"
"

  Slow interface and all apps are on go version which does not work to its full potential.

"
"

  Samsung M01 over all a good and budget phone by its looks and price but there are a big problem in phone and It  becomes to hot during call and use of internet over cellular network . I hope this will not be in all future handsets and company will take acre this problem.

"
"

  Product was delivered before the time. Though simple and small in size it has a smooth touch with all basic facility like any other smart phone.

"
"

  Screen quality very impressive,Light weight and handy,Looks very Cute,Sound quality is great,Only RAM is less, but the price also matters.Overall a good deal and nice product from Samsung. 👍

"
"

  Phone is awesome till now..battery is also good, camera quality is also good overall in this range samsung delivered good phone . Best part is that, it is very light in weight ,very handy and all apps are run very smooth.

"
"

  Galaxy M01 core is really best smartphone for normal use...Display quality is superb... And battery backup is also good...Overall Product is very good in everything

"
"

  Phone is good with nice display, battery and response time. But just forget that it comes with a camera. Camera is not usable for a photo or a video.

"
"

  Serves best for basic users,I took for my mother who only uses whatsapp and calls only

"
"

  It's a small phone but but feels jus like an iphone. It's really cool and compact. Perfect budget phone. The selfie camera isnt great but back camera is awesome.

"
"

  I bought Samsung M01 core on 15'th aug and today  ( within a week ) it has stopped working. Now I am struggling to find service center and reach out to Sansung

"
"

  THANK YOU SAMSUNG MOBILE LTDI AM BUYING M01 THIS PHONE IS VERY GOOD GIFT FOR MY WIFE COMFORT MOBILE GOOD FOR GIRLS👩‍⚕️👩‍🎓👩‍⚖️ THANK YOU AMAZON

"
"

  After using this mobile for just one week I came to the conclusion that this mobile is a failure model since it has a high amount of heating problems during charging and very poor battery. I returned this product within a week and switched to another mobile.

"
"

  This phone is not performing as expected. Phone is hang most of the times and getting warm very often.I have a very bad feedback on this phone as it stop responding with in 15 days of use. This is not expected from Samsung.

"
"

  Disatisfied with the product. The sound and mic are not good. Amazom has replaced a product but it is with same issue. Hence returning for refund. I will.go with different brand now. Not satisfied with samsung now.  They are cmning dwn on quality

"
"

  I got this mobile at time.Good phone with Google Go edition.Everything is fine and gentle. For those who have limited work ,not hunger for Games.

"
"

  Good Mobile.

"
"

  Don't ever buy this phone, within 5 days my Phone is dead! Performance was lagging since 2nd day, battery life is very poor, takes a lot if time to charge.Now I have requested to return but they aren't even considering my request!

"
"

  Must buy according to price.Very smooth and friendly user interface.Camera quality is very good.Samsung is a very reputed and good brand providing top features in this price segment.

"
"

  I got this Samsung Galaxy M01 Core on September 05th and this mobile is not been working from September 14th onwards without having any damages. It's automatically switched off and we we were tried to switched on but not able to do, so please help me.

"
"

  After one day the phone has become dead. Even after full charge it is not working. Please let me know how to return.

"
"

  Battery is worst part of this phone.At this price nothing much expected.Too much lag or hanging freezing alote.Just use it for calling and WhatsApp only.

"
"

  Cheap qualityI love Samsung but found cheap qualityThe cable wire used for changer along with sim tray wrose Chinese itemMade mistake

"
"

  My humble request don't buy this product. Completely 3rd class product and not even worth of 1000 Rs. In all aspects thus model got failed . Don't fall into the trap by seeing the price and AMAZON don't even provide return option for this product.

"
"

  Third class product I cant keep it even for free and now amazon is making foolosh by ssying to dounload fake aaps in witch costumers had maken comments that this is fake

"
"

  Delivered 15.8.2020. The phone just stops working  every  2-3 days and needs to be taken to Samsung dealer. It’s absolutely useless. While charging it gets very heated.

"
"

  This is good for 2nd phone look wise good, average battery life & camera quality, full value of money, services of Amazon is good delived in time

"
"

  Return window is closed and phone stop working in 15days..... please don't buy this phone

"
"

  Phone is good , rear camera good,front camera average, battery life good, display size in length good but width narrow ,price good , weight perfect, charging late,But one problem delivery is lateI received phone after due date....

"
"

  Pathetic Service by amazon. Providing defective piece with no option to exchange it for a better model.

"
"

  tHIS IS REALLY SURPRISING THAT THE PHONE IS DEAD AFTER USING 15 DAYS.

"
"

  It's really value for money and light weight.  I have purchased both Samsung Galaxy M01 Core 1GB and Samsung Galaxy M01 Core 2GB .

"
"

  Good product but i given 4star because size is too small ....

"
"

  This brand new mobile after inserting the SIM CARD and started downloading the apps it worked for just five minutes and screen got switched off and is not getting on from then on. It is the worst product that I have bought in Amazon.

"
"

  Product is fine enough to use but  more expected from samsung price is under 5500 improve your charger it's take 6..7hrs to charge full

"
"

  Would like to thank the Amazon Delivery team for the quicker Delivery.It's a Good Product to use and user-friendly with basic features.Recommended for Secondary phone or Minimal usage Smartphone.

"
"

  It heats up very quickly and stops running..I was return the product but this product return policy it's not available ... I hated Amazon .. so cheap Amazon company .. it's company terms and conditions it's totally lie.. .

"
"

  its good n value fr money n more over brands says everything .me n my whole family using samsung n nw my charity hv donated this phone to a girl ......she too like it ....

"
"

  Thanka Samsung and Amazon for providing a phone affordable to my pocket that enables my wife to help kida in their  online study. Thanks Samsumg once again to help my family in undisturbed learning.Thanks !!!!!!

"
"

  Totally disappointed in Amazon.After reading other people's reviews, I came to know many customers have received defective phones and are struggling for replacement.Not expecting this for 'Amazon fulfilled' product.

"
"

  Please don’t buy this phone. Very slow. Poor audio quality. Poor battery life. It’s just only 11 days since I bought it.

  1. Good product.2. Price is justified but mobile is of small size with less features.3. Good mobile for voice, video and data communication.4. Camera is average.5. Battery backup is also good.

"
"

  i dont know what is the problem with this mobile. after two weeks of useage, its not working now. its not evening turning on. China mobiles would work longer than this.

"
"

  I have used many Samsung mobiles. I find them user friendly. Featues are good in Samsung Galaxy M01 Core.  Only problem with Samsung mobile is it has too many inbuild software.

"
"

  Weak processor. Weak camera. Average battery life. I bought for 6499 and after 10 days Amazon was selling it for 5999. Phone hangs while doing daily work. It gives ok type user experience only.

"
"

  Phone is getting heated within 5 min of uses, Screen was very sluggish... While speaking over phone won't able to hold phone... Battery will drain like 5 years old phone...

"
"

  Decent phone ideal for those who switch from feature phone to smart phone or your parents. M not saying that, everything is top notch features in this phone but still brand name and the price segment is worthy to buying.

"
"

  Mobile is automatically dead while using and not came up even after charging. Very poor battery backup not even 2hr with playing and one day standby.Camera quality is too bad.Don't buy this mobile.

"
"

  Light weight, beautiful appearance that makes you fall for it, and of course value for money.

"
"

  This phone is quite sleek n compact. Its got good screen quality n picture clarity. Battery life is also too good for the price range. This is the best phone in market with a budget of 5k.

"
"

  Budget friendlyIt's a middle class choice

"
"

  luckily Phone is good , but package is opened before delivery. Without checking I had paid money to the delivery person. Please instruct the delivery persons to not to tamper the packing etc., Charger is very delicate.

"
"

  If you are looking for a alternative phone or to gift to your parents This one is really good. Coz as u all know less RAM and smaller size is enough and good for older people and to use as a temporary or alternatively

"
"

  Just OK Product, Samsung should reduce the pricing as compared to other Chinese phones. In that cost, Chinese phones offer premium service while Samsung doesn't

"
"

  RAM SPEEED DULL,CAMERA LIKE 5MP, CHARGING TIME 4 HRS,BACKUP OK.AFTER USING 4 DAYS POWER OFF AND NOT TURNING ON CUSTOMER CARE SAYING WAIT 7 DAYS FOR TECHNICIAN TO CONFIRM DEFECTIVE PIECE.*******DONT BUY*********

"
"

  Use product deliver to me.opne box in use the handset after sell

"
"

  Great value for money phone;pros:>Battery backup is awesome>has dark mode.>2GB ram and 32 GB storage with additional sd card slotCons:>taking lot of time to charge

"
"

  After one week of use , the product went dead and not able to restart. Unfortunately the return window is closed. So we son't know what to do with this faulty product.

"
"

  very quick delivery, phone is average built quality, performance is ok, but no Samsung special features in this phone, house peoples gift this phone, camera is average, battery medium average, screen look nice👍👍👍

"
"

  The mobile is very light weight. Although the phone is good.But it has a problem of OVER HEATING. You don not make a video call over 10 minute.  After 20 to 30 minutes use it runs slow.

"
"

  Don't buy this .waste of money ...over heating and hang problem ...no return no replace ...dont buy from this seller

"
"

  On 15 th day of delivery of mobile, mobile got shut down automatically. Not started after several attempt.Called Amazon, they said sorry could not help.

"
"

  It's good at this price range. Battery life shoul be extended a little more and camera should be improved too. I'm impressed by looking this type of screen quality at this price range. Well done Samsung👍

"
"

  The Phone has gone totally dead after 7 days...Is it manufacturing defect or is it due to delivery of substandard items....It needs to be replace.... process of warranty...its cumberson through online...

"
"

  I have received a call from technician Amazon,so very helpful,,mobile is going well now

"
"

  Overall phone is good but the internet calling and camera is not at it's best. Battery life also okay and it is in budget

"
"

  Value for money, donot expect much,its good

"
"

  Worst phone ever seen. The phone doesnt work, gets switched off within 2 days and never gets on. I got this phone replaced 2 times and still faced same issue.Dont buy is my review!

"
"

  Heating issues and battery  drains at rapid speed..

"
"

  Good design and battery, overall a good phone at this price range but I am getting some heating issues but not a deal breaker.

"
"

  I got my phone on 20 august 2020,  today on26/09/2020. my phone is dead suddenly, without any indications or probpems,It didnt fell from my hand,  or no issues till yesterday,  i dont reccommend this phone

"
"

  Phone doesn't support some apps , while using the zoom app phone is strucking,sometimes audio and some times video is strucking, we can't see both in 1 time . It's performing like 256 mb ram phone not 2 gb ram .

"
"

  The product was not working from the 2nd day of purchase...even after escalating the problem to amazon..their response was hands free..now I have to depend on the seller for the service of NEWLY owned product...

"
"

  There is some issue in sim slot because of which network reception is poor

"
"

  Good product... But sometimes feeling that it's slow processing... its having 2GB RAM but not so effective performance

"
"

  I was sick of big phones tearing my pockets, at this price this is just amazing, thanks a million samsung, like always,

"
"

  This phone is worst... After one month the phone is dead and not charging also. I am not sure if this covers in warranty and it is additional work to go to service center.

"
"

  Very nice product..... I know that Samsung is the best Electronics Brand so I brought this Phone..... I am glad for use this..... Phone on top ranked by me I guve 5 stars of this Phone.....

"
"

  Within five days of purchase, problem occur  in display. Now the phone under dead condition. I have to run to service centre. All service center are too far from my location. So total waste and mental torture.

"
"

  Value for money.. good clarity, great storage space.Some times the mobile hangs with no response. To full charge, it takes close to 2 hours

"
"

  Battery got.discharged suddenly and did not wake up normally....samsung support advise to wake up using vol key+power key..it started again...otherwise value for money..good phone

"
"

  This phone is one of the best purchases i have ever made. It is best for whatsapp,facebook and other social media apps.Battery life is also good.Sound quality is upto the mark.Camera is also good. Must buy !!

"
"

  Product is very bad.Product purchased on 24th Sep and mobile is dead on 1st Oct.Replace window also closed on 1st Sep.What to do in this situation. Amazon should look into the matter for immediate replacement

"
"

  My phone just suddenly stop working and the display is off it is not getting switch on or off please tell me what to do. This happened when i was using my phones hotspot

"
"

  Good one in this range.2,32 is goodBattery should be 4000mah to fulfill all requirements but as Samsung is a famous brand so can't expect everything in such low cost

"
"

  Problem with signal the call will drop  in middle of conversation

"
"

  This phone stopped working after 4 hours of use. It didn’t get switched on again. Whenever  camera was on, it went very hot. Completely damaged product was given to me. Don’t buy from this seller.

"
"

  Good for this price

"
"

  Revie after 15 days of using mobile, battery comes for 4 to 5 hours in standby. Poor battery life

"
"

  Don't buy this handset... Not worth to pay this amount.. We cannot download anything#hangup#no music folder only Spotify.. Not happy with this handset can't return also.. Only replacement with same handset

"
"

"
"

  Its a good phone . Its Price is worth it . Display is amazing . Camera is kinda okay . The best thing is that it have android 10 go version .also light weighted .And last its trustworthy brand .

"
"

  Poor sound quality for music. Battery is draining faster, not continuing for one day in normal use. Not a good phone in ₹ 6499. Can it be possible to replace with other M series from the same seller ?

"
"

  Samsung is always best option as compare to other but I think the quality is not appropriate of this product. But in this buzet this is still the best choice..😇

"
"

  Very good one in this cost range.

"
"

  Nice , working fine up till now.. it’s been a month

"
"

  on the day of reciving the phone, it switched off all of a sudden and doesnt start back, when i tried to do a replacement , its a terrible return or help service from amazon. I didn't get any help.

"
"

  The phone charging is very very slow and suddenly goes into sleep mode. Once in sleep mode it does not charge and battery gets drained. It's not even one month and already visited the gallery twice

"
"

   I m really disappointed with the services , I purchased the phone as a gift for my mother-in-law after 2days phone goes completely dead ...bad experience

"
"

   Good

"
"

  Phone has switched off completely after 2 weeks of usage.Check for other reviews and you can find similar complaint.Do not waste your money with this phone.

"
"

  The phone is working smoothly.

"
"

  This is worst smartphone in market doesnot support many apps as well as take 7 hours in full charge. Screen is not very good and camera is worst if someone give this me in free i will not take it.

"
"

  Battery Backup is goodScreen quality is opCamera is goodI like a mobile screen qualityNo lag No heatYou play a free fire in ultra graphics in 1gb ram in this mobile

"
"

  It’s not even been a day we’ve had it and it doesn’t turn on. Called Amazon and they say they’d send a technician!?? Ridiculous- why won’t they replace it?

"
"

  Battery was not charging from day 1, it always shows 30%

"
"

  Though the phone was worth it money but it stopped working after a day or three i have called the amazon service agent and they said tomorrow they will call waiting for it.

"
"

  Battery Life : ok at this price.Camera quality: don't use in night.  In Light Camera Performance is Tooo Good.Overall  : this phone nice choice for your parents

"
"

  I purchased a new phone on 12 Aug 2020, now it's suddenly switched off and tried my best to switch on but unable, so total waste of money

"
"

  Battery drains fast charging is very slowHeating issueIf you want to online classes or play a gameYour fingers feel burnBut phone is enough to that price segment

"
"

  Good mobile with in the budget . Hardy set with good quality but camera is not so good but overall it gives peace of mind

"
"

  Product was faulty. This mobile automatically got switched off. I also faced with difficulty while charging this phone. I would suggest spend few thousand rupees extra & buy another product

"
"

  Some functions are not available for better battery life

"
"

  The video calling and zoom application is not working with this phone. It is having audio issues only at the times of video call and zoom meeting.other than that all are in good condition.

"
"

  Worst experience of life in buying the mobile. Amazon not able to replace the faculty piece. Phone is dead on the date of delivery. My appeal to the customers not buy products from Amazon.

"
"

  Did not meet basic expectations

"
"

  Good phone to use as secondary. Light weight. Very difficult to find tempered glass for the phone.Camera very average. Overall a very average phone. Did not find any cons as of now.

"
"

  Nice Phone  this price.

"
"

  Lightweight,suitable as a second phone,senior citizens will like it.sufficient m emory for apps,my earlier samsung on 5 was lacking in memory.smooth perormance.a perfect gift to parents.

"
"

  the best part of this phone is very sleek in the model and handy lighter in weight. Worst part very very slow like an earthworm. I don't think its value for money...!

"
"

  The battery life is pathetic and the phone is turning off automatically. Would suggest not to buy this phone.Amazon support is also poor and they have refused to return the phone

"
"

  Budget phone very good it’s awesome perfect phone in low range price price is lesser than redmi phonesI got world’s best brand phone for 5.5k

"
"

  Worst phone ever purchased no battery life no good to use and stopped working just after 1 month and no service total waste of money... disguisting and not recommended at all

"
"

  Value for money

"
"

  Phone comes with 1gb of ram, hangs a lot and switches off automatically. It's better spend 1 or 2k more and buy a mobile with 2+gb ram & better hardware

"
"

  Great piece for basic home use.

"
"

  Slik and handy. Value for money received the item within a day.

"

"
"

  Phone permanently dead within 15 days. No replacement after 1 week as Amazon displayed. Now what can I do? Thinking for go to consumer court instead of service centre.

"
"

  Bad camera quality, exchanged with Samsung on5 which has same camera feature but on5 was far better. Heating problem as well, battery drains out very quickly

"
"

  As per budget this is a good phone. Camera &screen quality is good but battery power is not so satisfactory .Thanks to Samsung for giving a smartphone in this budget.

"
"

  Overall a good product from Samsung at this price range. The battery life is average.  The camera quality is good. The display screen is large . Connectivity is good.

"
"

  Battery drain very fast, mobile heats too much,inncessary pre-installed Applications, and important thing don't buy this product from amazon, because of poor service

"
"

  WHILE IN OPERATION THE PHONE GET HEATED UP TOO MUCH,BATTERY LIFE OKCAMERA FUNCTIONING OKNEED IMMEDIATE REPLACEMENT OF MOBILE SET AS FEEL DEFECTIVE.

"
"

  Do not buy this phone ever & replacement is also dead within 3 days. Samsung for India is a bogus initiative and misleading. This phone is a failure model.

"
"

  It is completely dead after using one week.. The mobile just shut off automatically and doesn't turn on.. waste of money.. i need it to be replaced at any cost....

"
"

  I worst my money. After 8hours charging when I switch on the mobile is heating.And i don't have no option for return. Only for repair solutions in amazon aap

"
"

  Nice product ...sleek phone with good quality

"
"

  This phone can be use as secondary/for aged person.screen size little bit small for regular use.

"
"

  Very good mobile phone in its price range.Battery life is good.Camera quality is  normal,long screen good for gaming and video playing,slim design,value of money.

"
"

  best phone for just basic uses,if you are a hardcore gamer or a mobi addict i won't recommend it,it gives performance as it worth,best phone to buy at this price.

"
"

  Not working that day

"
"

  This is an overall good phone.But in case of camera quality it's not good. More than that the processor speed is low and the phone starts heat!

"
"

  It's just awesome, the camera, battery and looks worth buying. I bought this for my Dad for his birthday. Thank you Amazon for timely delivery.

"
"

  My samsung m01 core battery back up is very low and it takes more than 8 hours to get charged completely.... Kindly replace my battery with in guarantee period..

  Nice phone from Samsung in this price. Display is good . Camera is not awsome but average. Battery will last 1 day with normal usage. N it has all necessary features. I got this for 8999 . So good phone under 10 k.As samsung so last for years.

"
"

  Gifted it for my mother. It is perfect size , perfect placement of power and volume buttons, has dust on phone after opening the box but the box was sealed, same thing happened to me when I bought M31,Pros.* Perfect size* Samsung brand* Good build quality for this price* Android 10* One UI 2Cons.* camera is below average* Average display quality* No earphones in the box* No fingerprint scanner* Takes very long time to charge battery.Will update this review after few weeks.

"
"

  I have compare a samsung, Panasonic, and MI mobile. Mi is better in terms of bettery (5000mah) but all the other specifications are same in this range. I prefer samsung because of brand value and I don't want to buy Chinese products.This Mobile is good for average use and battery last for 24 hour. No heating problem.

"
"

  This smartphone is very handy and responsive. The cameras are not as good as other smartphones in this price but it gets the job done. If you want a very hand and easy to use smartphone this is it. The quality is the best in this segment.Pros:1. Small, handy and light weight2. Display is good3. battery capacity is good4. fast and responsive for normal tasks5. Durability ""It has a plastic body and looks premium but extremely light and durable""cons:1. Not for gaming2. charging takes 3 hours 30 minutes3. cameras are not good compared to other smartphones.

"
"

  I have been using it for a week.I came back to samsung after using Redmi note and it feels so much better.The touch and feel iss awesome. Fast an smooth operations with anroid 10. Lots of intelligent features at this price like limiting screen time for each app and winddown function in the night etc.. Camera is decent for normal photo. Sound and speakers are good for clear conversations.The only thing which might be a downside for some people'could be compact size of screen especially if you're used to big screens. It might take some time to get accustomed if you are a frequent movie watcher.Overall it's much better than the so called value for money brands like Redmi Oppo Vivo Realme etc which are primarily winning customers by offering more storage battery and big screen but lack performance.A good to buy phone for  9000

"
"

  Its not value for money,  just passable,  its very tiny phone, not wider enough,  please see length and widths specification specifically.Very slow chargingNot good cameraIf your are planning for students for class, its worthless.

"
"

  After watching so much negative reviews from paid youtubers about this Phone, I dare to buy this one because of my guts feeling, and I'm happy to have this phone. DON'T GET TRAPPED UNDER NUMEROUS FRAGILE FEATURES IN CHEAP PRICE BY OTHER COMPANIES. I ONLY WANT DURABILITY.

"

  The description said it had fingerprint recognition facility. But it didn't have the faciity. And that was one of the main reasons of deciding to buy it.

  This mobile has software problem it seems, within 10 days of usage it hangs a lot. Also it has mic problem, when you attend the call the caller at the other end won’t be able to hear you, you need to restart the mobile for couple of time then it works. I can’t use it like this for longer run, please help me to return the product, I will handover the mobile by doing factory reset. Please review and help as soon as possible.

  I bought this for 8990.. Now it has reduced to 8399.. The product is worth the price. Before buying make of the purpose of the usage.. This is a budget phone and is not for gaming.. My dad needed a phone which has decent battery life and whatsapp for official usage.. He doesn't use it for anything else... I wanted to buy only Samsung phone. I finally concluded to buy this..Pros.1. Good battery life.2. Size is not big. Hence easy to carry. (This might be a con for few)3. Doesn't heat while charging/ normal usage. Though few have complained of heating. However I didn't experience any heating issue.4. Low sar. (0.61 W/kg- head). I particularly check for SAR value before buying.5. Doesn't heat on normal usage.  This depends on how u define ""Normal"". The apps my dad use are few banking apps, Whatsapp, YouTube, and for office use6. Smooth UI7. Android 10 with latest security update.8. Good call quality. Even after hours of calling it didn't heat up.Cons.Can't complain about these coz you get what u pay for.. Lack of fingerprint scanner and slow charging are to name a few.. Samsung can include a screen guard too. :)However getting a Samsung phone for this price is really worth.. Samsung= Quality & Reliability.Samsung is an innovative brand. They spend lots of money for R&D to bring out new feature. So when I pay for Samsung Iam paying for innovation. :)I will be buying M31 s in next sale.. Samsung 4ever! :)

  Don't buy any Mobile from Amazon if you are not fully aware abaout the product. After buying they are not entertain you for returning/replacement. Pathetic customer support by customer care service.Very upset from Amazon, they are only making money from India with cheap policies.They are asking to download an waste app in your phone which has 1.8 rating on play store and asking you for permission of  your personal information.And yes this mobile has very cheap quality and only sold due to less option in Indian market. Only samsung mobile left in market if you don't want to buy any Chinese mobile. Not a single Indian mobile available in own Indian market.Samsung making good money with its cheap quality mobile phones.

  Not worth the price at all! I am writing the review after using 17 days!Pros.1. Handy piece tho a bit heavy it's good to operate.2. Front camera is cool.3. Good face lock AI.Cons.1. Worst camera ui and I don't think this time samsung has their quality over the camera the back camera is worst.2. Not a worthy battery life.3. Too highly priced.Totally I'm not satisfied!It's better to buy any other model other than this. If not the new realme model is of the same price almost of this and has super good features. You can choose that or any other model from Samsung itself but don't choose this model coz there are lot of flaws in this... so its not worth the price.Hope my review helped..

"
"

  This is just to get your job done. don't expect too much .Pros : -** display is good.. no complains.** sound okay** can uninstall bloatware except few samsung specific ones.** very handy. form factor is nice.** Battery easily lasts for 2 days on normal** Samsung One UI is too good.Cons : -1) Camera very big disappointment. Only expect good pics in outdoors under good lighting conditions.2) Charges very slow.3) Having a tough time finding a good coverNote : No tempered glass or headphone will be provided in the box

  I have purchased for my mother. She is learning operating android phone 1st time. The item is handy as the screen size is smaller than ours 6"" phones. On the performance side the set is quite fast. Battery is getting  heated during continuous use. Just a week has passed sonce the phone is in use. Further details may be provided later.

"
"

  it says camera is 13MP but when you click photo it seem like it is just 2 or 4 MP.very poor camera quality.

"
"

  Pros:1. Look and feel2. Buttery smooth display3. Build quality4. Rear camera quality5. Good performance for minimal app usage6. Value for money7. Samsung !!Cons:1. Fingerprint scanner not available2. Internal storage could be bit more3. Front camera

  Samsung M series, great phone in this range all are value money. Let's see here the SAMSUNG M01 phone: red colour , thin design make gives beautiful phone look. It has optimised performance with low power consumption that's gives you longer battery life time. It does not have finger tip sensor, bought it for grand parent who do not actually need it, some time in emergency you don't wish to have these security features.  At this budget with exchange offer got a great deal a brand new phone with loaded feature at 6500, isn't good. Front camera is average, clarity is good however back dual camera is good, inbuilt animated shot can give you different experience. The phone having good voice and sound quality, inbuilt and expendable memories are now improved than older phones gives you the freedom to be entertain. I love the display quality of samsung this is unmatched feature. Phone size is small and compact so can easily carry it in pockets, or keep it with other phone if you keep two phone.If want to have phone at low budget or secondary phone for back- up with reliable brand it's a good choice.ver all it's a great quality branded value for money phone.

"
"

  Poor audio quality. Ordered it for my parents but both microphone and speaker volume is poor by designInstead of having the speakers at charging jeck thay have it on the vack side. When call comes no one is able to hear because the phone is keot on its back.Despite of buying via prime fulfilled, Amazon refused to return item.

"
"

  My Personal genuine reviewSamsung Is overcharged for this phone, the brand which most people love in india.Samsung is Overpriced his every Phone in india, using anti China sentiment of Indian people.If you buy this phone remember it will take total 4 Hours to charge Fully😂.Charger is only 5v 1amp.Samsung price 8.5k for this phone and doesn't even satisfy now days criteria.Camera is also Bakwas😂.Resolution quality really you will hate after using because I think it's 480ppi Resolution. Because also have mother HD+ phone which is more clear than this m01.Performance is also not upto the mark.All disadvantages in it.But there is Only one advantage if you also antichina then you get 'Samsung' only 'name' from non Chinese brand.That's only advantage 😂Buy if you want to let samsung use anti china sentiment and let samsung earn more money via overpriced.

"
"

  The product is good and worth for the money given. I got it for 6950 after exchanging the old Samsung.Battery life is good even after continuous use . Display and camera are very good.  No lagging.  For a middle income group it will be a good asset . No fingerprint reader.

"
"

  Nice, does what it's supposed to do. Dual-sim works well. I use it as a backup phone to my Galaxy Note, and it works well.

"
"

  One of the best smartphone under 10kI bought one for my dad it works very smooth no lag or hanging issue and it's also surprise me with a gaming review I tried few heavy games and that worked really smooth camera is goodOverall I loved it in this price range thanks  Samsung and Amazon

"
"

  Bought this one on 25th August, reviewing on 22nd September.Battery life with a pocket friendly size is the only good thing about this phone! The headphone jack is behaving so erratically...it automatically reduces or increase the volume of audio/video being played and despite pressing hard on the keys or trying different earphones, the problem persists...even after a factory reset.Also, the charging socket has stopped working properly, so now I have to place my phone at a specific angle or keep holding in my hands in that position while charging the phone!Screw you Amazon...7 days replacement policy is just not good enough!

"
"

  This mobile was delivered on 23-Jul-2020. After 9 days of use, the volume key and power key is not working. Worst product and services by Samsung and Amazon. No option for replacement. They are distributing defective products. Please refrain from buying this mobile.

"
"

  Now this is a great phone for its price point ( under 9k )Battery is great, display is bright, speaker voice is clear ( not the loudest but works 9/10 cases ), Great UI/UX of android, average camera.There are alternatives available of this phone and you can check them out too but you won't be disappointed with this one.Things you will miss -Wifi tech is older - it won't catch the ultra fast wifi networks ( still works well with average wifi connection )Bloatware - a lot of unnecessary apps ( doesn't annoy you but still feels forced )Average camera - works fine for good daylight pics but the focus is slow and is pretty bad in low light.Old charging port - Does not use the type-c standard now and no fast charging.

"
"

  This phone is meant for a very small group of people. First of all, it is a very small display compared to other flagship or even other low budget phone . The only reason one should buy this is either they love Samsung ui - android 10 or they need a backup phone with very less radiation. The snapdragon 400 chip set is a very outdated chip which does not provide even close to the performance from other phones from this range. Well , after this you might think that the camera might be great. Wrong again , the 8 mega pixel camera can maximum take photos uptown 4 mp(which is not of even good quality either) and the front facing camera is just trash.Talking about spec sheet, out the the 32 GB, you only get 20. And out 3GB ram , there is only 1.5 GB ram which you can use. Running simple applications take about 2.5 GB ram.Battery is decent(finally something good about the phone) but it will ofcourse be so ,as there has been compromises is every other part of the phone.  In the box comes a 5 watt charger which takes ages. At an age where phones can charge uptown 100 watt, it's totally unfair that samsung gives us 5 watt charger. There is no inbuilt screen protector or back case.The dual camera setup is just for name sake. Please don't buy this phone for the camera or performance.Like I said earlier,  this phone is useful for old grandparents or children with limited usage. With is budget,  you can get better phones such as narzo 10a or oppo phones which are better and give relatively good performance too.The phone doesn't lag much but due to the small screen , online class or videos will be hard to attend. If in case you plan to buy this phone , try contacting a physical store as they can give you a better price. Another problem I noticed, the charging cable is smaller than the normal size. Makes it difficult to charge.

"
"

  Superb product, Battery back is very GoodGo for It rather than our ""enemy country's"" products, you know what I'm talking about 🙏

"
"

  It’s a value product by Samsung at a decent price in less than INR 10K . I personally like the screen size 5.7 better than 6.4 in other M and A series phones. Anyone can go for it! Has got a rich look ! I’m happy with my decision.

"
"

  Its a value for money product from Samsung. Though I am not a big Samsung Fan however this model is a superb option when your pocket is tight on budget and you need a good quality smartphone. Phone build quality is sturdy and gives a nice feel in hand and looks good too ,Battery life is good , camera quality is sufficient, screen is good but no fingerprint reader. I really like the screen size (5.7) which is far better that the big phones (6.+ screen size) , because of bit small screen phone fits well in hand and gives the easiness to use with single hand. Samsung should have also provided at least a wired earphone with the phone (should not cost Samsung much) which is missing in the box.

"
"

  DISPLAY: The TFT Display quality is good compared to other cheap brands, the viewing angle is also good, does not fade out much when you view it from different angle. Brightness is also sufficient.BATTERY: Battery life is very good. Hours of basic usage (online classes, calls, whatsapp, browsing) and hours of gaming. Using since 15 days, not found unnecessary battery drainage.CHARGING: It's little slow if you are used to a 10W of a fast charging mobile. 1% increment in charge takes 2 minutes and 10-15 seconds approx. But mobile does not heat at all during charging.PERFORMANCE: Zero lag during web browsing, youtube, switching between apps, online classes via skype, zoom & google meet. One UI is really very smooth. I don't play pubg, but it's easily playing games like ""IAF:A cut above"" in ultra graphic settings with no lag or frameskip.CAMERA: The major issue with this mobile is it's camera image quality in low light condition, it's very poor in low light (without flash) but with flash its ok ok type. However the back camera quality in day light or indoor light conditions is good, not soo good or bad, its just good. Selfie camera is not good at all. It needs softwere improvement.CALLS: Call quality is great and loud on both sides.CONCLUSION: If you need a compact, good looking, good in hand feel and durable non-chineese phone with basic to medium usage like online classes, low to medium intensity gaming and smooth ad-free Ui then definitely go for it. However if you want a camera centric phone taking pictures all the day and especially selfies, it's not for you.

"
"

  Very cool and decent mobile, as specification smooth touch, good processor, android 10, average camera, less SAR value,  NO heating issue at all. No back cover, no ear phone, charger not modified (old type), no fast charging. At last no signal problem, good buy for Rs 8998.

"
"

  Overall it's an average Smartphone.I would tell you about some basic parameters.PERFORMANCE- This Smartphone is having an average Processor. So, don't even think of playing heavy games like COD or PUBG. But if you are buying for normal usage than it works quite well but lags sometime as it has 3GB RAM.CAMERA- It has a decent rear camera. Depth sensor is on average and clicks normal portrait shots. Front camera is below average so don't expect much from it.BATTERY- It has 4000 mAh battery so if you have a normal usage then it works easily for 12-15 hours once it is charged 90%. One problem is that it comes with a 5V/1A Charger so it takes much time to get charged.One more thing is that it doesn't have finger print scanner.It has face unlock that works quite well.At last I would say if you want to buy a non-chinese smartphone and your budget is around 8.5k-9k then you can go for it. This phone is for moderate use and from my view it will easily work for 3-4 years. And if you want gaming or better specs then either you go for Chinese phones or make your budget large.

"
"

  The phone is Samsung's offer for those who want a budget phone within 10K. In these Covid times, every person wants a smartphone, but there are not many options, what with many persons not wanting to buy Chinese products. This phone is the answer to them. It has all the features a decent smartphone offers, and is not too heavy on the pocket. I sincerely endorse this product and ask fellow persons to try this.

"
"

  but now there is some problem in the phone , it's display is not working  well

"
"

  Best phone at this price !pros-Looks 5/5Display-5/5Sound-5/5Camera-4/5Battery-5/5cons-nothing found still ! will update later!If you are at this budget to buy a phone then definitely buy it , you won't be upset !

  Gud compact phone

  This phone would be awesome if it's price were 6000 0r 7000 but it's price is 9000.9000 rs and still no type c charger.9000 rs and still no fast charging.9000 and still no fingerprint sensor.9000 rs and still pathetic speaker(sound is very low and clarity too is patetic)that too on the back. no phone nowadays have speaker at back.9000 rs and phone looks cheap(bad plastic material is used)in 9000 rs u would get far better mobile than this mobile.if the price would be 6 k or 7k ,i would say phone is good.but in 9000 here we r getting undervaluer mobile with no fingerprint sensor,pathetic speaker ,no type c charger,cheap lookSamsung have fooled their customers.

"
"

  I bought this for my aunt. Performance is good actually. I’ve put lots of apps and the speed was good. Speaker is not that loud but for the price it is good. Camera is bad but for people not wanting it, it gets the job done! I’ve also bought M01 core (2GB) which is way inferior compared to this. M01 core’s camera is worse than this. For people using only Facebook, Whatsapp... M01 core would be fine but for a price difference of only ₹1900; M01 offers a lot more!

"
"

  Like : Right now fast access, feather touch key, good camera and picture quality, excellent customer care and remote access of the phone.Dislike: Some important feature like 'Screenshot' is absent in scroll up menu that is to be brought from Accesibility option of setting and put on Assistant menu. Which should be a ready option in scroll up menus. Incoming phone call sound quality was very poor however that was resolved by guidance from Customer care by remote accessing.Battery life which needs to be more longer.

"
"

  Post 3 days of usage :Battery - Excellent battery backup (goes up to 2nd day effortlessly - gaming not included in usage).Charging - Fast charging is a miss vs competition brands but while using the device didnt feel it as missing since device sustains entire day smoothly so no probs.Built - Plastic built but from the looks alone it feels good (have a red one) not premium though.The size of the device makes it a superb grip and ease of use with single hand.Display & Touch - Display is small vs  competition. Colour/Brightness is decent enough; no complaints at all. Touch is buttery smooth.OS - Android 10 (though not stock android like Nokia) advantage against competition; very few devices below 10K giving Android10 as out of the box. One would experience it during daily usage.Camera - Worst of the lot i guess; shaky, noisy images and videos (rear and front both) .. it was a shock - Samsung should do something about it in the next s/w update.Except Camera rest the device is very good at the price point!

  Phone is good as per this price range with samsung brand value but i have more more expectations

"
"

  I am using this phone for more than a week now. I'll try to lay down the pros and cons.Pros:-* Perfect size, best for single hand use and also good enough for watching films and videos.* Battery life is decent, with moderate to slightly heavy usage it easily lasts for a day or more.* Android 10 from the box.* With3gb/32g it functions quite smoothly. No lags whatsoever.* The speaker sound is loud enough and clear.Cons:-* No fingerprint scanner, the face unlock doesn't work well. So you need to depend on pattern or pin unlock.* Doesn't support fast charging, takes around 3.5 hrs for full charge.Some othe points :-* The camera is definitely not the best in the budget but is ok considering the price point.* display isn't amoled but its again decent enough for the price.Finally i would definitely recommend this phone to the ones who are searching for phones in the budget segment with the brand assurance of Samsung and a single hand usable device.

  Superrrrb Phone if u are looking for a backup phone for unlimited phone calls and browsing and watching Videos/Live TV.The phone doesnt have a finger print reader but has face recognition option.

  You have way better options at this price. This phone is pathetic and its cam is scam, I ll tell you how. when you open cam and open wide angle mode cover one cam out of two. You would realize cam 1 is working, now change the view from wide angle to normal and check by covering cam again only cam1 is working cam 2 is a showpiece. I know how it works because I have other phone with 2 cams.Display avg. Battery is good, No option to do screen mirroring or smart view.Disappointed totally and now cant return...

"
"

  you have lots of options available in that prize, I have order because there was a Replacement guarantee but its only if the phone has fault with it, if you dont like the phone on Design or features you cant change! Amazon wont allow! i was ready for buying Samsung M21 if they were allowing me to change the phone, so be sure before ordering the phone.its a Grandmother style phone!!

  Good budget phone for common people.Overall the phone looks good , at this price 3 gb ram and 32gb space is at best price available. I bought these phone after comparing each model available with 3gb,32gb combination.Features:Value for Money.3GB ram and 32 GB space good enough for daily use.Samsung brand is good as compared to chines phone.Touch sensitivity is good.Not too big in size . can be handled with one hand..Drawbacks:Battery life is okay not great.

  Build quality is really good. I like Samsung Glance app showing news on our interests in the lock screen. My old phone had fingerprint sensor which is missing in M01 but face lock and unlock does the trick and works well. Likewise, I used android one UI in earlier phone. The only feature that i miss is swipe left from home screen to get Google news feed. But then again, its a software feature. My earlier phone was a 16K costing one and still it lasted only 1.5 years and i learnt that since the hynix eMMC used in device hit its lifetime, writes started failing and so phone became unusable. So, I wanted to buy Samsung this time as Samsung eMMC would be more reliable and would last longer. Snapdragon 439 SoC processor is just right enough for regular phone use. Camera still pictures would look super good provided person holds the phone still and even after clicking needs to hold the phone still for couple of seconds or else, the pic appears distorted. Would recommend this phone for sure as it is sturdy and very good value for money.

  No finger printer reader. A handy phone thats of perfect size. Camera is of poor quality  ,doesnt give the 13mp result . Takes more than 3hrs for charging.The product is good when delivered, no faulty packaging or anything as told in other reviews. The charger too gets heated fast. The phone started lagging even aftr the first hour of use(just a 2sec lagged..like it was frozen),then came back.Overall for this Rs 8k its the perfect phoneand better than using any chinese phones.

"
"

  No finger print option and phone size would have been 6 inch+.  Now a days competitors supplying the mobiles of matching quality with specified features around same price. In order to retain the existing premier position commanding in mobile segment, hope Samsung focus much to bridge such gaps. Overall it's  a nice experience with this mobile  so far and found to be a good value for money in budget phone segment , for this hard core Motorola user since beginning who opted this  mainly due to its OS with latest android version 10 which enables to  access his company applications supporting only with android 10 and above since 1st October 2020.

  Hi All,Please don’t buy this product as this model hang always.  I got this model and used only for 5 days after that suddenly it got dead. when i put in to charge for more that 30 minutes also it didn’t get start. Post contact to samsung support suggested to press both power & lower volume button to start but still it stuck on home screen. You can see the image. Finally Amazon denied for replacement also even after 6 days. i am sure defect in this model so guys request you please don’t buy this product. its my pathetic experience on amazon & on this model.

"
"

  it is a better option in this price ,much better than other Chinese brand smartphone n this range.

"
"

  Nothing great about this phone. All the mentioned features are there. Value for money. Good budget phone. Works smoothly. Camera is not that great.

"
"

  This phone is so under rated. Got it for ₹8400 and I guess I didn't made a mistake.I don't usually play games  so its probably the best non chinese phone. Best for daily use. Battery backup lasts for a day with heavy social media use and light gaming.  Even played COD mobile and PUBG on low settings and the game play was fine.  Charging takes around 4 hours with the in box 5w charger, but can be charged with a 10W charger. Overall a good product where my privacy isn't jeopardized.

"

  Samsung at 7,999 with all features, it defenently swipe away all China pieces which don't have quality.Pros:fingerprint reader - face reader is working awesomely so need of fingerprint readerLook and Quality  - excellentcamera quality  -  not too bad.Ok under 10kBattery life-  lasting for whole dayFunctioning -  smooth and fast.Price - Cant imagine more than this.ConsCamera - ok.Overall at this price it's praise wasool.Can take without second thought.

"
"

  It's really a value for money product. The battery, screen, processor which your get for a price tag of 8998 is amazing. Good speaker and no heating issue. However the camera quality could be better.

"
"

  Good entry level Android phone. Those who are looking for basic function and minimalistic features can opt for this manufactured in India product. 3 GB RAM & Battery capacity enough for daily moderate usage. Camera quality is good but not the best when it comes to low light photography. Overall happy with SAMSUNG basic Android phone. Good if you are planning to gift it to elderly people/parents

"
"

  I was searching for a handy smartphone for long time. I found this realesed recently and purchased. Everything fine, if Samsung included  fingerprint scanner, this one is the best small form factory  smartphone ever. If you ready to enter every time password or pattern to unlock (with face masks unlocking with face recognition is not possible) go for it. Otherwise find something with fingerprint unlock.

"
"

  Just got unboxed on 11th Oct. And after 5 mins the phone started to heat up, tried playing game which i normally  play smoothly on 2 gb ram starts to lag. When continuously  browsed for about an hr it would start to hang a bit not much.And  honestly battery  life is superb for this range phone BIG OK to that, camera quality is poor yet doesn't matter i always look bad on cam so dont care abt it much.And here is the worst part of this phone just to get 5-6% charge it almost took 45 minutes is terrible.After experiencing such terrible experience  requested  for refund but AMAZON wont refund me said it can only be replaced. Had a very bad experience. Viewers here if you still wanna give a try on this product then go for it, configuration is good as no deny it SAMSUNG BRAND after all.

  Reviewing the device after using it for more than a week. Find my pros and cons below:Pros:1. Battery: Battery backup is super impressive if you are a normal user. I don't play games but have to take calls through the day as I am working from home and I also use its hotspot throughout the day and the battery doesn't disappoint.2. Camera - I know that this is the new age of triple and quad camera setups in mobile phone but I have to say that even though I had very less expectations from the camera it does a wonderful job. The samsung camera app is superb and even though it has limited features it still performs fabulously in daylight and nicely in artificial or low light.3. One UI- The Samsung's very own android skin is amazingly cool and makes the user experience so much better.4. Display- Even though this is an LCD display still the colours are punchy and even in sunlight the display performs well.5. Biometric- The face unlock performs nicely and unlocks the device in a jiffy.You will not regret the absence of a fingerprint sensor.Cons:1. Charger: As it is a 4000 mAh battery the absence of a fast charger is something that hurts. They could have included the 15 watt adapter that they offer with other devices.2. Case: Though not really a necessity, presence of a protective case would have been so much better.There aren't too many cons as this is a really good device for normal usage and you would be able to use it for all your essential needs for day to day basis.

  Very economical, an excellent phone for this budget.PROS...Since it is Android 10, we can apply dark mode and hence battery consumption is less.Also, even latest apps can be installed in this smartphone due to android 10.3GB Ram provides an excellent working condition to this phone. Even Pubg can be played in this phone without any sort of hang.Massive screen with infinity V display helps to see the online classes and movies very clearly.Dolby atmos provides an excellent utility to this phone. Even with a worthless earbud, by using Dolby atmos, it sounds good.It has a huge battery of 4000mAh and also massive  storage of 32 gb ram, which is worthy for a normal user.LAST but NOT LEAST, I'm very happy to hear that this is an INDIAN smartphone designed by INDIANS. Make in IndiaCONS...Even it has an octa core processor, its processor is very low when compared to redmi and realme phones in this price range.It does not have a fingerprint scanner, but has a fast face unlock.Even though it has a huge battery, it has a 2hrs charging time.So although it has some cons, it is a smartphone with many pros and some cons. I like it very much.What about you ???

  I gifted this phone to my parents. Also, It's better phone for normal use as a spare phone. I use Samsung M21 for myself 😊I believe in Quality and not Glossy looks of the phone like the Chinese phone offers in market these days.Plus points• 4000 mAh Battery• Infinity-V Display• 13MP Dual Camera• Android 10 is fine to have at this budget.• Qualcomm Snapdragon 439 Chipset. Minus Points• Camera is not that good• A bit heating issues• Display is so so.. 🙄▪︎Plus, I want to clarify I don't support Chinese products so that's why Samsung Budget phones are best choice phone for your parents. Go for it 🤗It's fully MADE IN INDIA 🇮🇳  so Up to you if you support that 😅 !!Thank you. Choice is yours. I'm happy with Samsung M01 phone for my Parents.

  Bought this for my dad, he likes it.  Its senior citizen friendly.  Only problem is with Samsung bloatware and notifications that are absolutely useless.I have disabled all notifications and auto updates.  Monthly once I update it manually.  The rest is fine. Battery life  is good. Camera is just ok.

"
"

  Awesome mobile phone and I bought from Amazon I got in one day delivery . the mobile everything is good to buy but taking more time to full battery. They wouldn't gave fingerprint unlock and also didn't gave fast charging. But I love this more because nice to handle mobile in single hand .I am using this mobile as .

"
"

  I bought this phone for my dad and he is very happy with this phone.In this range with the product quality it's better than any other MI Phones.Before buying it I did have a look on mi Note 9 and 9A and they were very havey in weight and big.And quality of this phone is better than any other phone in this range

"
"

  The phone is very good, i bought it for my dad because he wanted a small size phone and this was the best ideal size to handle with one hand. I love the software that is latest and smooth. You can watch the video on Tech blast Youtube channel. Samsung cameras are always the best and this is the perfect one for the price. Battery is ever lasting. It works for my dad for 2 days. Just the charger is very slow and no fast charger support, hope to get in any future OTA update.

  Like:One UI 2: twice as good as stock android and equally fast3gb ram is enough for running many apps simultaneouslyDouble tap screen to wake screenGood display. Phone looks like midranged doesnt look or feel cheap.Dolby audio for surround effect in earphonesNot made in chinaDislike:No fingerprint readerBad camera front and backJunk apps pre installed. Had to remove them.Exchanged 2 year old asus lite l1 and got this for 6100

"
"

  Amazon make fools in the name of amazon mobile sale...just after sale price drops 8400 from 9000.Mobile is ok but slightly higher priced it should be around 8K.Design is not feels like premium Samsung brand and slightly thicker!

"
"

  A budget friendly good brand phone ,i gifted this phone to my father ,Pros:1-camera quality is good in this price.2- 3 gb ram is sufficient if you're not so addicted to picture clicking.3-battery life is good .Cons:1-little bit heavy , but can manage.2-screen size is small as compared to other smart phone in this price range.

"
"

  Camera, sound quality not so good as mentioned.. Not happy with this purchase. Trying to return from last 2 days but no option is available.. Totally disappointed.

"
"

  Well its my third Smartphone and all are Samsung. Reason is quite obivious it seals the deal everytime with everything under one roof. So reviewing it after 3 weeks of hardcore usage.Pros:1. Great performance. Processing power is quite good, even frame rate syncing seems good.2. Battery Life is awesome3. Stunning Design (Red colour looks damn sexy)4. Value for Money5. Thin Body great benefit for the one's like me who use the smartphone with one hand.Cons:1. Camera seems a bit average due to over bright and filtered pictures. I loved the old cameras by Samsung which had touch of originality. Capturing even the wrinkes and imperfections on your face. Please bring those back2. No Fingerprint Sensor.Overall a smart buy with tight budget.

  This is a rip off by Amazon. It's not even been a month since I bought this phone for my mother and the phone is having multiple issues.. Apps just shut by themselves every few minutes.. Wifi connectivity does not work .. phone keeps hanging and there is major lag.. I had already made a complain that the cover was damaged when it was delivered got zero response on that. Don't expect such negligence from Amazon and as a customer I feel cheated.. !! Major dissapoitment .. I am now stuck with a phone which does not work and have spent almost 10k on it..!!

  This phone is another value for money product from the house of Samsung. The following are the things why I like and dislike about  the product:-Pros:1.Battery Life- with 4000mah battery the the battery is powerful for day long intensive use.2. Display-with 5.7 infinity display, the screen the best you can get at this price range.3.Processor- with snapdragon octa core processor the phone is perfect for multi window functions and moderate gaming.4.Android: comes with the latest version of Android 10.5.Memory - comes with 3 gb ram and and 32 gb internal memory with sd card support upto 512 gb which is really good.6. The dark comes looks really cool to me.7. Shape is really nice as it sticks to your palm giving you comfort and I-phone kind of a feeling.Cons:Camera- I must say Samsung fails in a certain way when it comes to camera .Chinese brands are way ahead in this criteria. This is the only thing where Samsung misses out.Overall I give a double thumbs up to this device apart from camera.This is THE PRODUCT product to buy in this  price range if you want to avoid non-chinese product.Also not forget the good after sales service you get from Samsung,they have service centres all over India.

  Galaxy M01 comes with pre installed Android 10, which means the user shall have state of the art privacy and security features. Additionally, Samsung's One UI Core 2.0 provides simple user interface which is seamless and attractive.I have been using this phone from last 10 days and faced no issues. All the features are reliable and easy to use.Talking about battery, since I do not use social media and gaming, battery for me lasts for about 2 days after one full charge.You can also hide the navigation keys from the screen and still navigation will be seamless.Another best feature is that you can disable the pre installed Google apps on this phone if you are too concerned about Google collecting your personal data.I haven't used the camera much, so I cannot give review for the camera, but bear in mind that it comes with depth effect.Just one improvement the manufacturers could have maintained is not placing the speakers on the rear panel. The sound doesn't plays clearly when phone is placed on soft surfaces like bed. Some users might not like it.Overall, I find this phone excellent for myself. So, I give it 5 stars.

  I bought this phone for just one reason that it is a non chinese brand. Lets talk about some pros and cons of this M01  smartphone.Pros :BEST THING WITH THIS PHONE IS THAT IT IS HANDY. IT FITS IN YOUR HAND SO WELL. ALSO ITS SCREEN SIZE IS SMALLER THAN THOSE BIG SMARTPHONES.TILL NOW THERE IS NO LAG ISSUE.VERY LESS HEATING ISSUE.CAMERA IS BIT REALISTIC.MULTI TASKING IS SMOOTH.DISPLAY IS SUPER IN THIS PRICE RANGE.PLACEMENT OF POWER BUTTONS AND VOLUME KEYS  ARE SOMETHING IMPRESSIVE.ANDROID 10CONS :AGAIN SCREEN SIZE. AS NOWADAYS EVEN 5K SMARTPHONES HAVE  6+"" SCREEN.CHARGING IS A BIG ISSUE AS IT COMES WITH A 10V CHARGER. IT TAKES AROUND 3:30hrs FOR FULL CHARGE.BATTERY SIZE IS ALSO A ISSUE AS IT COMES WITH A 4000mah BATTERYMEDIA VOLUME COULD HAVE BEEN MORE LOUDER.AND MOST IMPORTANT IT COMES WITH SOME BANNED PRE INSTALLED APPS. IDK WHY THESE PEOPLE GIVE THESE THINGS IN A NEW PHONES.

"
"

  I got this at 8k and my mom likes it.Pros:I think it is best budget phone right now.No heat issues.No lag.Very good quality of screen even better than lcd screen.Camera at this price is decent it comes with all filters and beauty modes.Cons:Little bit Thick.Charger is only 5 watt.

"
"

  Phone is good at this price range with Samsung branding.Good thingBattery life very good with calling and data usageDisplay is bright enough in outdoor no issue with auto brightnessSound is clear for speakers as well as earpiece.Camera quality is ok for this price range. Rear camera is good and front camera is ok.Bad thingFace unlock not so fast compare to other brandsCharging take more than 2 hrs for full chargeShould provide at plastic caseRest phone is good for normal usage with faily activity of whatsapp and call and surfing internet no lag and any issues.

"
"

  Samsung is just not able to deliver the quality the customer expect from it.There nothing good about this phone,Its slow, hangs if you download a few apps, even its not able to support half the capacity other phone of this range/memory/RAM can support.In just 30 days of delivery the phone showed a display problem, and when I visited their service centre, they said it will take at least 4 days to fix the display issue. Which I believe, if done outside wouldn't take more then 10 mins. And as per them you have to leave your phone with them for these 4-5 days when they will be ordering and arranging the display. As if you bought the phone for ur baby to play video games and you dont have any important needs from your smart phone.

"
"

  Got a defective set, where calls keep dropping after few minutes. Doesn't Samsung do a quality check on its products, they sell defective sets. This does not have a fingerprint reader as mentioned. Not going to buy Samsung anymore, shifting to redmi.Reported it to Amazon, had a good customer service experience and they refunded the amount.

"
"

  One of the best smart phone in 9k Rs ...It almost provide all smart features like wifi calling, dual 4g, cast.....Surely better than chainees brand.

"
"

  I really very disappointed with the Amazon service center.I have purchased this phone on 27 September 2020 and I received this phone on 30 September 2020 the phone was properly packed and was in working condition but on next day it has requested software update and I updated it then it stopped working. I have contacted customer care they requested replacement for this phone but it was rejected by Amazon pick up agent. The agent said he needs IMEI number to confirm then only he can pickup this phone. I have contacted several times Amazon customer services, they arrange pickup but pickup agent reject it saying I can’t pickup this phone without IMEI number. How can anyone check the IMEI number if the phone is having software issue. It’s been 20 days now I am without phone because I have purchased this in exchange option.

  Samsung M01 is good for the one who is amateur with android smart phone. I have bought this phone in 8k and I feel with the brand name it is worth to buy these features with this much amount.Pros -1. Good battery life - Almost 2 days it worked for me. I have use whatsapp, playstore and had calls.2. Rear camera is good.3. Handy in size - I took this phone as it's display size is 5.7 inch.4. Face unlock feature5. Performance or speed of the phone is not bad.Cons -1. No fingerprint sensor.2. Selfie camera is poor, I expected front camera to be better. Do not take the phone if anyone have to click selfies.3. Samsung should provide a protection glass or cover or earphones.4. Miracast and chrome cast app causes the mobile to restart.

"
"

  I am happy to buy samsung m01. This phone is good in look, battery backup is awesome, camera is ok, and biggest thing i don't want to buy a Chinese phone so I will go with samsung.

"
"

  HiThis Samsung M01 is such  handy phone build Samsung ever.  The design of the phone Is stunning and there are no chance of slipping from hand .And people like me always looks for the phone which is handy with tons of feature .This display fluidity is awesome and there is no lag in playing games either.People who leads their life simple and subtle will like this phone .To mention few  addon would make this phone better .B1.Box speaker would be better2.Aluminum frame would give this model richer look instead.3. Updated chipset with more memory and with same harwarebuild will make this phone hurricane in entire smartphone market.At last expecting compact phone with tons of feature loaded .Thanks

"
"

  This phone is suitable if one's requirement is of a basic smartphone which is affordable, durable and comes handy.I am satisfied with the phone for the very same purpose that I mentioned above.The UI is quick and smooth, display quality is excellent and battery life is good.The only drawback I found for this category of phone is the camera quality which could have been better, but no qualms about it.Any other high end expectations would be defeated. After all it's a Samsung brand that speaks for itself.

"
"

  1. Overall feel good.2. Lags a bit but not that much that too sometimes, may be it will settle with time3. Fingerprint Scanner should have been included, that's bad not to have.4. While charging they should provide a indicator light on top of screen, every time have to click the button/unlock to check5. Vibration while touching menu/Back buttons at bottom can't be disabled6. Sound and Camera is Good7. Battery charging and daily life not that good but what more to expect in this budget.8. take it if your budget is low. its a good  Phone but dnt expect much

"
"

  This  phone is very convenient to use. 3 GB ram ensures it will not lag.32 g b memory is also sufficient. Photos are good  and  images are sharp and bright.

"
"

  Entry level mobile for basic call, messaging, and internet needs. Nothing fancy. Poor camera quality. Charging takes forever, but battery life lasts quite a while (with usage of call, whatsapp, youtube, no gaming). Loudspeaker is not loud enough.No headphones, backcover, screen guard included, charging cable is very short.Ordered this after getting frustrated with MI flash sale scam. Okayish mobile for around 8k. Would suggest to spend around 2k more and get a better mobile.

"
"

  Despite having 3GB ram it's pretty fast and impressive. Can use multiple apps at the same time. Battery life is superb, easily lasts for a day. Sometimes even more depends on the usage. Not meant for playing high end games though. If you are looking for a smartphone for your routine office work and other stuffs go for it but if for playing games you have to spend a bit more. Charging it takes almost 2 to 2.5 hours which is acceptable considering it's not typeC. If it had type C charger then it could have been a game changer for Samsung.I am really happy with my M01😁😁

"
"

  - Battery drains fast- Gets heated up during charging- doesn’t support 5G wifi (only 2.4 G)- camera is average- it’s ok, but only if you are a light mobile phone user, won’t recommend for current generation heavy/regular users.

"
"

  Hi,I purchased it for my Father.1) Good average phone.2) Better alternative for Chinese mobile even it was lag in some features.3) Battery is working for more than 36 Hrs after moderate usage.4) Butter smooth operations.5) Comes with Android 10. Hope regular updates will be available.6) Camera is decent.7) Sounds are clear8) Display is responsive9) Handy10) Missing fast charging11) Missing Finger print security12) Comes Office tools13) Suggest: Power n Volume button should be in same side ( Now frequent screen shots capturing without knowledge)Overall ""VALUE FOR MONEY"".

"
"

  This is an example of product made in India and made for India. Bought this product for my father. Battery life and performance is really good. Just a bit disappointed with camera quality. Somehow I felt that this product is bit overpriced. Samsung could have packed a headphone or backcover with this product. If you want to gift this phone to your parents or children I would suggest you must buy it. Moreover you can trust the samsung apllications. Hope this review helps :) Happy shopping with Amazon delivery was really fast. The pricing policy was also very strategic.Thank you Amazon. Thank you Samsung.

"
"

  Now don't buy any product from Amazon. They have changed their policy. Now they dont return items. They will only replace weather you are satisfied with the product or not. So now be aware. I am not satisfied with this M 01 phone so i want return but Amazon is not agree for return.

"
"

  First of the phone is has very good look and the price also reasonable from amazon.based on the two week usage the review1.the design was compact easily you can hold the phone in hand as we as packets2.battery life also very good3.important thing is screen resolution was ultimate and speed of the phone was very goodAnd quick response to application s4.sound quality also very good5.network connectivity superAnd drawback isCharging of phone the take time because they provide normal micro usbOtherwise the phone is very nice and go for it for normal users...

  Writing this review after more then week of usage, One of the best mobile at this prices. Got it for 4099/- after a exchange of my old mobile for 4400/-.* Battery was strong enough continuously used for entire day  Facebook, WhatsApp, video and calls. Takes two hours to charge 100% but will remain for two days to totally drain out.* Display was awesome and looks great with the stylish edge finish* Camera was great especially front great to take selfies.*Processor performing very well.After a month of  searching  got a great one with the for better price....

"
"

  Very high price in our segment Display is very bad quality and very very bulky product I said you go to other product just like real me Nazro Redmi nine prime

"
"

  This phone doesn't work well with Jio Network ( unable to make call and receive call, the call jets ends ), it works with all other networks, i thought its the sim card issue and got a new sim card aswell, but the issue persists,I bought this Phone Twice and i see same issue..Apart from Network failure with Jio, rest of the Product Functionality are Good at this price point

"
"

  Samsung is known for their eccentric and long lasting product.  This phone is no exception. Although in a sub 10k segment, samsung doesn't offer much, compared to it's market rivals. But surely this phone can be a good example of balance between budget and components.It definitely has good battery life, although it's quite new.  user interface is quite simple and easyto use. really low spec phone, meant for casual use. Camera however is bit overwhelming, has a absurd auto HDR mode, which results in very bad portraits.overall, it's  good phone for everyday casual use'

"
"

  Received faulty mobile. Mobile takes 8 hours to fully charge. Can someone advise what to do?I don't know what to do. Expect Amazon to help with this.

"
"

  This phone i bought it for my dad. Initially I was satisfied with this Samsung phone at this price level. In this Corona times, my dad went 5 times to Airtel showroom.  Changed Airtel Chennai SIM 3 times but Call drop issues did not get resolved.  Left with no other option, I bought Chinese phone with exchange option of 20 days used this Samsung Phone. I am disappointed with loss of money due to resale.We live near Chennai Airport (within proper city limits).Not recommend bcoz of Call drop issues.

"
"

  8k is too much amount to pay for this phone... Just bought as there are no option for non Chinese phone and Samsung is using this opportunity by adding premium to every phones or tablets..if you take selfies from this phone you will hate yourself .I have to struggle with swap function everytime to receive calls...

  In the world of smartphones, where all brands have started manufacturing mobile sizes from 6.5 inches to 7 inches which are like tablets, M01 is fresh breath. Just when I needed a much needed spare mobile which is non Chinese, with basic features and average RAM, ROM, good battery, M01 solved my purpose. Perfectly sized for my hand and pocket, 3GB,32GB is absolutely matching my expectations.Being a basic handset, I don't expect good camera and fingerprint is not thereAmazon delivery has been before scheduled time as always.

  Heavy Weight Thickness, Samsung UI User Interface Sucks Pre loaded (Installed) With Many Samsung App With Other Un Useful Apps, Need Less Price From Current Price 8399 As Per Heavy Weight and Other Brands Comparison Only Good For New User or First Time User.

  I've purchased two phone and both phone has performance issue. Sometimes unable to pickup the call and also sometimes phone is hanged.I've requested for return of this phone but amazon guy's are saying issue will be resolved after OS update. So I tried to update the OS and also tried factory reset option but is still there.

"
"

  Absolutely impressed by the phone.. that's why I choose Samsung every single time..no mistake by any way in the phone...no lag/hang..camera is also best..screen is just superb..noone gives you such screen in this price point but Samsung has given.. buying totally worth it..Best smartphone by Samsung in this budget.. Don't even look for those Chinese brands..no.1 phone with awesome battery backup and gaming performance is also good.. totally satisfied..user interface is friendly and finger print reader is also amazingly fast as well

  1. Incoming Calls are disconnected frequently once received.2. Internet not works even though mobile data is on.3. Not able to share the location from google maps.4. Volume/sound quality not good5. Sometimes blue screen comes in lock screen entering pin to unlock6. Display not good7. Camera quality not goodFinally not recommend this product and ready to return this product but unfortunately they given 6 days time to return the product but issues/defects occured after 6 days.

"
"

  This phone is good for performance camera is not so good does not have finger print sensor and ir blaster. Battery life is average good. Overall good phone to have in this  budget and anti China product. I prefer Samsung over any other Chinese brand either they provide much better feature. Design is good and comfortable.

"
"

  Received a dead unit and opted for replacement but more than 15 days have passed and the device still haven't been taken back every time when Customer care is contacted they say that the device will be picked up in next 24hrs but after talking to them for more than 10 times its like they themselves have no clue that what is going on they keep on saying that this time it will be picked up but its been 15 days and no replacement device is received or the dead unit has been taken back

"
"

  Network is getting disconnected frequently....

"
"

  Video calls made using this device Galaxy M01, 3GB where recepient are not able to hear my voice clearly unless I keep the phone close to my mouth as we do on a regular call. In short cant use for video calls, nor useful to record video with dialog which are not louder when played on full volume.Microphone looks faulty,  requested Amazon to return n replacement but taking  time, a week already lost.My first experience with Samsung phone is landed me in a doldrums.I hope I don't have to live with this defective device.

"
"

  I bought this mobile after seeing reviews of every mobile in this budget i could possibly  find and this was best in the segment1  it has best battery life which easily last  1.5-2 days2  camera is good . Face unlock works nicely3 display colours and size of screen is perfect4 handles every task smoothly5 ram management is good6 feels good in hand and nice build quality(plastic is not of cheap quality)7 Samsung's one ui is the best and user friendly

"
"

  I was shocked that there is. I finger print sensor available in this phone. Along with that the speakers (ear ,outer) are not audible enough even in a calm environment. When the basic features of a smart phone are lacking in this phone, does is makes sense to buy this phone?No.If there is a no return policy exists on the amazon purchase, I bet the no becomes a big NO.

"
"

  No fingerprint reader, battery life  is satisfactory, once charged  it goes for about 1 to 1.5 days depending on use. User friendly interface but if you're using Samsung for the first time it will take sometime to get used to it as compared to Xiomi and Huawei phones.Also, few android features are missing like it doesn't show network speed, doesn't have additional volume button for only alarm setting and no separate tab for headphone advance settings. Other features , sound and camera is great. Handy and smooth running.

"
"

  We have purchaged this phone on 18 th Aug. and It is too early to share expert comments but can share our feeling towards phone, it looks very compact n user friendly as compared to my other phones. Battery life also very good. Very good looking a handy for normal users, never found any laging or any difficulties during usage. Lots of good and very useful features found in all segments of the phone. It provides you fresh n wow  feeling while  usage. Overall we can say more than worth to buy this phone in this price tag.

"
"

  The M01 phone has very bad call volumeOn full volume in settings still can’t hear the persons voice .. it’s v faintIs anyone else facing the Same issue ??

"
"

  Nice phone under 10k. I wanted to gift my father a non- chinese phone under rs. 10k budget and Non- other than Samsung could provide such facility. This phone is value for money and performing very good.

"
"

  This is a super  phoneAtthis price range.Small screen size so very comfortable and easy to handleBut also very powerful processor and has nice speed with a 3gb ramBest for users looking small, comfortable and powerfull and also best for everyday use.. :)Have a awesome battery backupAnd high security with a nice and speedful  face lock(fingerprint is not provided)Camera quality is okAlso has value for money.. !:)

"
"

  Camera quality is really good for price paid. Also battery life is decent and lasts for around 2/3ed of a day on continuous  hotspot as I use laptop for work and use this phone as my hotspot device.

"
"

  No fingerprintBattery  charging takes around 4 to 6 hours. Size is handy small.Have many features like smart sim which is both sim transfer call between eachother when busy.Internet while call etcGopd phone, dont buy if you're addicted to use fingerprint, faceunlock is not even 50% comfort as fingerprint

"
"

  Actually I bought it for my mother as a gift. Sound quality, camera and rest is oke but screen width is less, very small in size in fact...go for a unboxing youtube video then purchase it...I wanted to replace it for small size,but couldn't for Amazon's policy change!!! So be careful about size before order.

"
"

  A basic phone by samsung. Camera quality is not good specially at night. I bought this phone for my father. So it's ok for him.

"
"

  It's a horrible phone. Moreover to resolve the issue when spoken to Amazon representative he was horribly dum and he not even listened the problem to resolve. He simply denied to help to resolve. Even before replacing he advised to install app to check whether I m lying.Representative of Amazon was so noncoperative and insensitive. I decided not to purchase anything on this cheat app. Horrible experience on Amazon. If this can happen to a well educated person then what about a layman.

"
"

  Very very poor phone, not even one month and the screen is already damaged. Samsung is very disappointing and their services are equally bad. It's so sad to go through this, especially in 2020 when the world is making such tremendous explorations outside of planet earth. Here we are , still dealing with cheap phones. Stealing people's money on brand value and tricking people to pay more money by selling super super super cheap productsThis is the worst phone, EVER.

"
"

  Nice product if you are taking it as a secondary phone or upgrading from a keypad phone. Best for aged people.It will be more better if they provide a finger print sensor with it. It has 1amp charger i think they should give atleast 2amp charger as its battery is of 4000mAh which takes a lot of time near about 4 hrs to full charge from 1 amp charger

"
"

  Fast with 3gb ram and long battery life. Full battery lasted 4 days for a regular user like me without gaming. Camera is totally disappointing. Overall a good low budget range non Chinese phone.

"
"

  Fingerprint unlocking feature missing in today's era is a crime, I bought this phone assuming it a basic feature now a days, and since I was not interested in looks I ignored the back side (I was anyways going to use a back cover, which I already ordered along)..... But seriously... This only one thing will make this model fail... I would like to return it if the seller can take it back and exchange for a similar configure phone with a finger touch back, please

"
"

  The phone is good , as expectede . Some features however would make it a top notch .The phone does not come with a back cover , which is essential . It may add less thanrs 100 to the cost .Also some features in weather and daily panchang etc has scope of improving

"
"

  Over all the look of the mobile is so simple, it doesn't seema catchy at all. Display experience is also not as good as you find in it's previous mid range mobiles like on5 and on7 pro. You also didn't find this much good for extremely good picture. But they quite satisfactory. So here I guess you are only paying for battery, storage, prosessor sort of dual camera features and infinity display and most importantly the SAMSUNG brand.

"
"

  This mobile phone Samsung galaxy m01 is really very good and value for money , this does not have a fingerprint reader, but has a face recognition function , overall the phone is very good .

"
"

  Nice product! Galaxy M01 comes with pre installed Android 10, which means the user shall have state of the art privacy and security features. Additionally, Samsung's One UI Core 2.0 provides simple user interface which is seamless and attractive. I have been using this phone from last 10 days and faced no issues.Fingerprint reader is wonderful in this device.Battery life is too great.Camera quality is awesome.

"
"

  This phone is great. Good value for money and also it can be used roughly. The phone is very responsive and easy to use. But the face id is not that good. It doesn't recognize the face sometimes. But for the price, it's worth it. Also the back camera is quite clear. One more point to add, there is no sensor next to front camera. The sensor by which we can hear the whatsapp audio when we bring the phone to our ear. Overall, great phons for the price.

"
"

  Quality products

"
"

  This is best phone in this price the battery life very nice, and camera quality is also better than other company's phones with this price.I purchased this mobile for online studying in this pendamic situation there is boom to the online study and all company's has incresed the prices of mobile .ACCORDING to me it is a best mobile in this price no other mobile can compeet at this price and in procedure and other features.

"
"

  Phone lags and keyboard stops responding Many times .  Expected a lot better product from Samsung.

"
"

  Camera 3.5/5Battery 3.25/5Touch excellentDisplay 4/5Overall performance is Better within its price. But not best.It is not made for gaming.Is better for multitasking.I was hoping more from this phone but it's satisfactory and most of all I purchased because not a Chinese company.Jai Hind.

"
"

  I purchased this mobile for my mom.Good brand mobile in this price range.Sound & Sound quality is very poor I give 1 star.Mobile Size is compactNo Fingerprint scanner is a big disadvantage as facial recognition dont work properly.

"
"

  Camera quality is very poor...... don’t buy this phone worthless

"
"

  It is an Ok phone for normal users.Although not sure why Samsung skipped the fingerprint reader.They could have very well provided it at this price point, I believe.

"
"

  Worst experience with this phone..bought this phone a week back from amazon for my mom, in first week itself..facing network reception issues and heating issues.On top of that no proper support provided by Amazon, a tech visit was arranged at my place and the technicial reset and rebooted the phone stating that the issue has been resolved but still facing same issue, please do not buy this phone, not atleast from amazon.

"
"

  Good phone in the price range of less than 10000. Handy phone with super stylish look and the blue color one is more attractive. Good phone for a minimal usage person who use phone for calls messages whatsapp google and camera. Not suitable for big games like pubg etc. Better like is also quite good if you stop many unnecessary apps from running in the background. Moreover its not a chinese company phone.

"
"

  Some drawbacks on this phone - 1. Poor hardware causing more radiation. I already have burning sensation and numbness on my fingers and palm. 2. The phone is a heavy weight one, compared to other phones of the same segment. Thickness of the phone is just too much! 3. Display is narrow ( it may be preferred by people who like a little smaller phone). 4. Touch screen doesn't have a standard response effect, not that smooth.

"
"

  Although camera is not so good and pixels are bursting in jooming, phone is at satisfactory level. Rest of the functions are good according to the price range.  Camera quality is less than the usually. If samsung repair this loophole then I think this would be the first choice of the customer under this rangeThere is no fingerprint sensor then please suggest how can I rate you for this? 🤩

"
"

  Very bad camera.13+2 MP but look like a 4 MP rear camera,Very disappointed 😁😁.

"
"

  No regrets buying Samsung galaxy m01.Best thing I got best exchange value.Don't hesitate to buy.

"
"

  It's a very good phone at this price. Very smooth  touch, very good quality of disply, nice speaker  sound and battery  backup for whole day in normal use. Camera is also good if u compare camera of other phone having same specifications.Must buy phone at this price.

"
"

  The camera quality is just amazing.I trust only samsung for camera quality and this product makes me trust the brand even more.The sound quality is also good.Battery life is just amazing.Charge it once and it will last for more than 12 hours or maybe even more. Love it.

"
"

  Samsung Galaxy M01 is a good choice for a budget under rs.10,000. Now the price is also decreased so it's a good value for money if you are looking for a non Chinese smartphone

"
"

  Overall review is good. Though there is no such figure print sensor, but the other function is good as well. It has an additional function of blue light filter which may helps those who prefers to use it for long time.

"
"

  Worst phone ever. Don’t go for it because of the low price range. Display screen is so bad, while scrolling it considers it as touch. Camera quality is really bad. Does not have fingerprint censor. Face unLock almost doesn’t work because of the bad camera quality. It is facing problem with getting good network. Sound quality is poor. Overall very bad quality phone. Please don’t go for it.

"
"

  Nice made in india product1. Screen is good2. Camera quality in nice wide angle is main highlight3. Battery performance is good company should have peovided 10volt charger with it.4.face unlock works good5.very handy and sleek designOverall it gives a good value for money

"
"

  SIM tray didn't come out on very first time. Called customer care for help and finally return it.Happy with Amazon response and dealing, except return time.Samsung need to look into quality of there product.Still like this phone and ordered new one,Look and size is very nice, can easily operate with one hand, wish higher model should also come in same size.

"
"

  The phone size is really small which makes it almost inoperable especially the breadth of the mobileSecondly the ringtone volume is also very lowThirdly the refund policy of this phone only includes replacement and not even refund.Highly disappointed with the product as well as the return/refund.And I strongly suggest to go for other products in the similar range but not this one.

"
"

  I bought this phone because of it size but that was my biggest mistake because it takes around 4hrs to charge and that's why I have given request to return.In today's era of technology no one has that amount of time to charge the phone and after that it can't even last for a day. I have added a pic in that you can clearly see and if you start from zero you can see time around 4hrs.Thank You.

"
"

  First of all your replace and refund service disappoint me. You should not show while buying the mobile if you don't replace it after purchase.Camera is worst, battery is good but overall pricing is too high as offering the configurations.

"
"

  Product was good but slight defective send back and got refund immediately very fast response by Amazon

"
"

  I strongly believe that this product is the best at this price that I have ever seen before. A profound series released by samsung for lower budget people. Thank you samsung for this incredible item. Overall performance is great, mainly processor and battery. Btw, I am loving this face unlock feature. It just unlocks mobile within a second. Once again, thank you for this masterpiece. Worthy purchase!

"
"

  having used for over a week, sleek designgood interface and performanceaverage cameraFair battery life.only issue is that the camera hangs when you open the app after a long time. need to close it and reopen again

"
"

  Cons1. Too many samsung ads and services2. Samsung service notification cannot be disabled3. mid range camera4. face recongnition cannot telypros1. good spec at this budget2. trusted brand3. call quality and recording good

"
"

  It's camera is not satisfied . And screen size is little smaller than other smartphone... Overall good but not the best according to its price. Other brands will give maximum features than that samsung galaxy M01.Biggest Disadvantage is that it takes too much time for complete charging but battery performance is good. And other issue is it's camera quality is blurry .

"
"

  Its a good phone for this price from samsung..... i bought this phone via amazon....after using this for 2 weeks i am writing this review that phone is good working and have a good battery power.... camera quality are also not bad.... good display with a nice processing speed...  only a few second needed to unlock using face...  so fast unlocking.... and overall its a good choice  for parents.....

"
"

  This phone doesn't have screen cast. Is it that difficult to have this small feature included. I tried external apps including samsung smart things as my TV is also Samsung but didn't work.So iam disappointed

"
"

  Worst phone I’ve ever seen from SamsungIt has so much of screen issue, and the same can be seen while clicking pictures , making the phone ridiculousWhile turning ON the dark mode every colour shows a white shadow which is obviously irritating and annoyingPhone also lags in recording the calls by 1 or 2 secondsBattery is good since it was a new phone lol

"
"

  Phone super but not fast charging mode

"
"

  M01 - an economic phone, looks good, battery life very good, user interface good, performance very good, camera not bad. Overall good value for the money spent if you are having normal use!

"
"

  I got this phone with no sound clarity and no picture quality as delivery boy throwed from very long distance at door , I want to return this product and it's not working, complaint raised since I got this phone no one is taking action from amazon and returned allowed me on 5th sep , I did it but not taking return

"
"

  Don’t believe everything on reviews. Phone is good for those who don’t want 6inch and heavy weight phone.

"
"

  The mobile  was very handy and too fast performance, display is too vibrant  but optimum size for usage....totally  mobile was awesome with this price....Samsung  brand  quality  is good, snapdragon  process did best , samsung ui looks very disent

"
"

  Performance of the mobile phone is very bad,Amazon technician respoce is Very bad

"
"

  Good cute and handy phone value for money. Fingerprint reader function not included. Charging time seams to be little bit long.

"
"

  Best phone in this range, Smartphone with latest Android updates. Ordered for my Father who had not used any touchscreen before. Became comfortable in merely 4 days . Backup is really good. All app can be installed.  Main thing Made In India. Really happy with choice. And in current Covid scene amazon really delivered geniun and safe way. Thanks Amazon and Samsung.

"
"

  I bought this phone on 8 th August.  It phone is awesome. Its camera is not too good but also not too bad . It size is too good . It very easy come in pocket . So , it simple to carry . It had light body .It had value for money . So , I am big fan of samsung mobile because it give us value for money . Samsung m series is know for battery it clearly prove by this m01 phone .

"
"

  Got this mobile for my parents..very good for low to medium usage people..didnt want to go for Chinese brand mobilesDisplay is the best as it is SamsungBattery charge holds good for 2 days with normal usageFinger print scanner not availableCamera quality is goodOverall very good phone!! Highly recommended made in India product..

"
"

  Good phone under Rs.9000/- budget. Received on 21.08.2020 on exchange of my J7 nxt. Apps run smoothly. Very handy with 5.7 inch screen as the borders are very close to screen. Camera is good as per price. Battery is decent as 50% power remains till night with moderate use(calls & games, browsing). It has Qualcomm processors hence heating is very less likely.No finger reader.

"
"

  3gb and 32gb is worth for money for Samsung brand though u get cheaper in other brandHowever I am totally disappointed with Samsung M01 on the bluelight feature as it is not at all effective and harm our eyes and I am thinking to return this product as I don't want to compromise with eyes whatever brand and configuration.Hope Samsung here my concerns and help

"
"

  This mobile is one that can be rated as average but at this price range, it's a good buy. Additionally, it comes with the assurance of the Samsung brand.

"
"

  Awesome Amazon service..i bought in amazon prime within 24 hours I got delivery my mobile.its superb fast service and brand new Samsung M01 . Superb display and camera 👌 battery charger.. overall mobile 4.3/5Packing of amazon is wonderful.

"
"

  Amazon have given description that mobile contains fingerprint scanner but we was shocked that the phone was without fingerprint scanner.Other Companies provide fingerprint scanner in similar segments.Not satisfied with this phone at a price of Rs.8400Faceunlock of this phone is of very poor quality.

"
"

  The best thing about this phone is that it's very handy and light. The size fits smartly in your hand.Nice looks. Performance also is good enough. For this price.2 things that I did not like is:1. Camera. Not a good one.2. Takes time to charge. (Because of its charger)

"
"

  The processor works well andcthe camera is handy atvthe given price. Thecsleek finish looks similar to other prime phones available in the market. Overall it's a good one to carry at this price of 9k

"
"

  Average mobile with poor camera.Battery life is decent.Offering less features compared to market.Go for other good deals, not recommended.

"
"

  The only negative point of M01 is not having a fingerprint reader,besides that the camera quality is not bad at all,the ""battery life"" is also quite good.in this price range the Samsung  M01 is truely a quite good smart phone.So go for it without hesitation.

"
"

  Awesome mobile at this price range.Recommended for light users

"
"

  Good non Chinese option at this price. Camera is very poor both front and back. Yes, battery takes 3-4 hrs to get fully charged from zero. Presence of notification light and fingerprint sensor would have make this phone a very good option. But overall good option for the people who don't want to play around with this phone.

"
"

  worst mobile phone in this price, very very badly hanging issue in this mobile, also touch is not smooth, camera quality is very very bad

"
"

  This phone doesn't have a fingerprint sensor. The battery is very good - with a normal use, after full day the  battery still shows 80% remaining.Speaker volume is not good should have been a little louder. That is why 3 stars. Otherwise would have given 5 stars to this phone at this price.

"
"

  This product is not good, feature are very less, and amazon not provide return or reffund policy, they are not considered the customers satisfaction.They are looking for business only,forcelly added mobiles to customers

"
"

  Samsung m01 is handy and easy to use with one. I gifted this to my mother. The camera quality is good for this price. For a normal user i thing this phone is ok.Cons:Face id is slight lag in low lightFingerprint sensor is absentBut i like the product for this budgetI think this review can help others.

"
"

  I was planning to buy any phone available in lowest possible range with basic features. This model was already bestseller and it costed even less than my target budget. Functions great, I charge it after more than a day.It doesn't have fingerprint lock, call recording option and its own music player. Rest everything is very convenient and handy.

"
"

  Avoid Chinese products such as REDMI, REALME as they are very dangerous for our PRIVACYOutstanding battery lifeCamera quality of rear and front- Very goodScreen quality is good.RAM management is excellentPrince is excellent at this priceQualcomm Snapdragon 439 processor is good enough for daily uses

"
"

  Great build quality.Surprisingly good camera.Smooth touch.Quality of call reception and clarity of voice over microphone is superb ( many friends have remarked about the crystal clear voice over phone calls)Quality of the loudspeaker is very good.Great phone for regular use.Attaching a photo sample.

"
"

  Pro.slim lookCons. Worst camera

"
"

  Sleek yet robust! was using a Chinese brand earlier and found this one in exchange. best is the battery life, I am using since last month and a half now but one charge and it's enough for me for a full busy WFH day.  Camera and other performance are of the right choices for me. Overall a good deal under 7k for me.

"
"

  Its too early to give the review.Finger print feature is not given :(However overall product seems good for now but we noticed that call was getting disconnected every 2 mins but however this problem seems to be solved after software update. Other features are looking good and functional.

"
"

  Not worth. Touch Is horrible. Camera god got nothing. Display horrible. Very slow. Don’t buy. I purchased because I didn’t wanted to buy China made. Nationalism came in my way rise in this price could have got nice phone

"
"

  Configuration on paper is good but camara performance remainded me the Old VGA camera. Very poor picture quality. bit disappointed today.....A suggestion to samsung guys if you people overlook the present scenario , you will miss it forever..... I just purchased it because I don't want to go for other brands for some specific reason...

"
"

  Great for its price. Simple yet elegant design.Pros include:-Great battery lifeBuilt in Blue Light Filter (to protect your eyes)Dolby Atmos (enhanced sound performance)Attractive pricingLow SAR valueConfidence of SamsungMinimal BloatwareValue for moneyGo for it!

"
"

  Great features in this price...Samsung rocks really..... full value for moneyAdd a 32 gb memory card and enjoy...

"
"

  Good purchase. Loudspeaker volume is a bit on the lower side. Quality and usability is good, and as expected from Samsung.Camera is good but not outstanding. As expected.

"
"

  It is a very nice  Mobile in mid-segment, The build quality is good,  Impressive screen resolution &  decent battery back up.  In this budget,  It is difficult to get better mobile as compare to this.  I have red color variant  which is really very good color. A brand company mobile by Samsung. Go for it.

"
"

  Let's all about it clearlyCamera-2.7/5 low light very bad,day light okPerformance- 3/5 not for pubgBattery- 4/5 for moderate usage,heavy usage3.5/5like continuously 5 hours we can see youtube,moviesOverall 4/5It was good for me for my light usage.I don't use cameras and i do not play games

"
"

  This is pathetic mobile if you think, it has good performance rating in case of battery life. I will give 0 out of 10. Battery never charges easily.Battery is the soul of mobile, if it's drains out or not charges fast.. it worst to buy...Not recommendedThanksAbhijeet

"
"

  Value for money. Very nice phone at this price. Decent display and works well for my office (wfh) usage too.

"
"

  Not happy with the phone.  since it has no fast charging... takes 4 hours for charging fully. Does not have type C cable..

"
"

  Okay so finally we got some good midrange phones from samsung. Just loved it good specs in this price

"
"

  I have purchased Samsung Galaxy M01 and this mobile is simply Awesome and worthy.  The battery performance is good and for me it's one and half day, coming to camera there are many options to take a beautiful picture, in this price this dual camera is fine.  Ultimately, I am satisfied with Samsung.

"
"

   Total waste of money. It's not even been a month since I bought this device and it is almost non functional. Hangs so much that I cant even unlock it. Been facing this issue since a week now. Have restarted and factory reset still the issue.

"
"

  No finger print reader, good product for ealder people, College students with all basic features included - good camera, touch - can easily fit in pockets and purses- definitely recommend to buy

"
"

  Good battery, display and responsiveness is good. Camera is avg as in a samsung. Mi has better camera, but bought this for samsung brand. Good for this price range

"
"

  Phone is ok but having some problems like caller could not hear my voice and sometimes display related problems.Although they have provided replacement but they would not replace instead they would suggest some app checkups that would say your phone is alright.

"
"

  Check after you get the ptoduct. I ordered this phone a got a defective one, it's sim card was not ejecting. I ordered to return they took 7 days to complete that process. But got my money back very soon. The phone is good compared to  chineese toy phones. Has a good built up quality and good for aged people.

"
"

  I received a defected phone, I informed to customers service they provide a technical support person he visited me and comforted this is a defected piece but Amazon customer service not provide replace the mobile. This all long process to replace the defected mobile it's takes more than 10 days.

"
"

  Have had several smartphones in the last decade. Build quality of this one seems to be the lowest. Phone was in my pocket and no idea when and what instance it cracked but i see the screen is now cracked. I purchased this phone barely one month back. Really disappointed.

"
"

  Very Poor Product ... It's very Disappointing us..I Purchase this for My Grandfather for they easily work and Battary running whole day.. But this Pjone Battry is very Rediculous and Work mode is not much good

"
"

  Always been a samsung fan so I was sure while choosing this phone. User interface is very good. In day light it captures very good pictures.  Battery life is quite good. Easily go for 1 day in one charge and if internet is not used than almost 1 and half day. Just wish speaker was a bit louder.

"
"

  Poor main / rear camera.Quality of the picture and colours are not at all impressive which is totally contrary to the brand. Not useful for photos. I recommend the phone only for voice calls. Coz Sound is good. Finger print reader and battery life is satisfactory.

"
"

  Camera quality poor. Even Nokia 2mp is good than this. Network signal poor.my jio sim getting full network in other mobile but here it shows 2or maximum 3 network bar.only battery good.

"
"

  Speaker stopped working in one day.Bad customer service from amazon representative when asked about can 1 day exception as the phone was for old person and she took time to understand the amazon representative talked in very rude tone indirectly telling that amazon is  doing a favor on us but not customer service

"
"

  1st we received damaged phone, which we returned [after lot of effort] 2nd phone was also not working , amazon assigned engineer who came and fix the issue but the product is not worth spending money.Honestly we wanted to return but it can only be replaced and not returned.

"
"

  DO NOT BUY this mobile because once you get the delivery you won't be able to return it. I'm facing overheating issues and when I tried to replace it, an Amazon tech support called me and performed some test and then said it's a normal temperature. On other hand my phone was heating and I had barely 2-3 app installed.

"
"

  This mobile phone speaker are not working and when i am submitting to return this mobile they are saying to first download some app and verify that your phone is defective and after that we will see. i just want that product exchange then why i have to test that defective piece? I am very disappoint with this product.

  M reviewing after a month of use, with 3 GB ram phone performs very smooth, its filled up with m kid's apps and games. Battery backup is good... bt takes too much time charge..can't complain abt camera its prity ok for phone in this price... just missing fingerprint reader.. on the whole phone is worth on this price..

"
"

  Overall its good, for whom the smartphone is required for only social media...fb, wtsup, youtube, and some daily usage..The calling sound of the phone is very very low, u can't hear the other person in speker even, internet connection gets cut while talking in normal call, its too old system they have given...

"
"

  Good phone for elderly people for basic smartphone use with samsung Branding, but if you want the best value for money phone in this budget then there are better options available in the market.

"
"

  Mobile Hotspot not working properly....It showing connected but internet is not working. Every 10-15 minutes it's getting auto disconnect and take time to reconnect 2-3 minutes approx.  How to manage work if this type of issue occur every 10-15 minutes. Samsung please look in this and resolve it ASAP.

"
"

  Awesome phone in low price range, look,size,performance all superb.Above all its Samsung no worry customer service brand.only negative point is it's not having fast battery charging and C port.

"
"

  Very good phone for People who need phone for calling and for using regular application....Thank you Amazon.

"
"

  Its a nice phone with great 2 days of battery life average camera , nice build quility ,slightly heavy in weight but justified as its has good battery capacity overall nice budget phone from samsung

"
"

  Good phone in this price range. If you have problems with buying a costly phone, just go for it. Please don't blindly believe in all the reviews which say battery isn't good and camera isn't good. They are decent enough. And it is also smoother than my other phone having 4GB RAM. Just GO FOR IT!

"
"

  Samsung M01 seems to be good in performance, battery, camera if you consider Samsung as a Brand and its price. if Non Chinese phone is what you are looking for at this price range,  Samsung M01 is obvious choice

"
"

  Length  and breadth ratio is not at all good. This is having very serious defact if you are making audio call through WhatsApp then the screen should be always on otherwise you can't hear voice.  Now on Amazon no return policy for many things only replacement

"
"

  I brought this phone 30 days ago. I could not hear sound of incoming calls and battery is very poor. It takes 2 hours to charge 20%.This phone is of very poor quality, if possible I'm looking for return. So sad to get such poor product form amazon

"
"

  Not good.. better buy m11 or m21

"
"

  Very good at this price. Worth the money.No earphones, no fingerprint sensor. Bought this as a gift to my mom. Its perfect for her.

"
"

  it was a good device but sometimes face unlock doesn't respond. only one face can be registered at a time for face unlock. its a disadvantage. performance wise it was good for day to day usage.

"
"

  I think you should not buy this phone because you can get a good one by spending 1500-2000 rupees, not a good display , not a fingerprint reader,unable to take long screenshots, despite this all it's a budget and good battery life.I'm unable to return it because of sellers TnC,i want to buy another one .

"
"

  I purchase this mobile for my friendsParents (senior citizens)For whatsapp video calling with their sonAbroad..It's done best..Thank youAmazon and SamsungDelivery too early even in this lockdown period..

"
"

  This is brilliant phone at this price range. Awesome Battery life, Awesome display. Performance average.Camera is average. Over all good phone main thing is this is Samsung not Chinese phone.I hate Chinese phones.

"
"

  I am very satisfied with the product because, I use the product for basic requirements. It is very handy, and smart. The battery is also very good for me i.e. as expected. There is no fingerprint options in this product. Camera is also nice for the daily use. I think it is one of the best budget phones.

"
"

  The phone is extremely well . At this price point the best phone

"
"

  No finger print reader (product is manufactured in that way )Can be used by the people who don't play games and use much appsCamera quality is not at all goodGood point is its handy

"
"

  Comparing with the other Chinese brand’s phones available in the same price range, this stands better.The phone is good for average daily usage & not for highly media consumption users.

"
"

  The mobile box seal was tampered, could see some sort of underlying sticker or tape outlining at the first stance. When opening could see the seal was already CUT open and was re-sealed!!!!Ordered Replacement.!Will update the thread once received Replacement.

"
"

  This phone is not being charged or is not charging from the data cable since I purchased what is this? The phone battery is not being charged what is this? Please replace it immediately otherwise I will file a case

"
"

  M01 IS A GOOD BUDGET PHONE. Camera is average. Battery will last 1 day with normal usage. compact design and light weight. charging is slow. good for students for online classes

"
"

  Samsung did it again. Galaxy M01 is a mid segment and budget friendly phone for a brand lovers and first time smartphone users. This is non chinese phone and branded and  atleast buyers can have a good piece of mind.

"
"

  Awesome budget smartphone with wide range of features. I bought it for my Mother and she loved  M01 very much.The display is amazing with color contrast. Battery life is very good and long lasting. Multiple applications are supported by the robust processor. Overall a must buy smartphone.

"
"

  Have been using it for the last few weeks, so far its quite a good purchase! Great phone for the price point, however, would have been better with a larger screen size. Since I am avoiding Chinese companies, this was my final choice. It would become a default choice if a larger screen was provided.

"
"

  I used to Have So Much Trust On Samsung Brand..But I Lost It Completely.. phone Glass Was Broken after 10 Day's of Usage.. It Was, I Gifted To my Father .. Really Heart Broken..

"
"

  I was looking for a good phone to gift my father and the same i found. Its an amazing phone at this price and too good looking.Good battry life with good camera.Totally worthy.

"
"

  It's great. Camera wasn't that good but have to acknowledge the battery life also processing is cool,better than the Chinese smartphone available at low prices tottaly worth it.I will recommend Samsung to my felllo mates definitely cause quality matters.

"
"

  Even though the phone comes with LCD Display , the quality of the display is very goodGiving good Battery Backup, Nice to hold and very smooth  in operation. The only thing I was disappointed  about this phone is not having TYPE C charging, But this is OK for this price range.

"
"

  Very nice finish. Sharp camera with nice viewing but low working with bsnl network for 3G network. And also not showing 4g/ 5g. This moble is only LTE/3G/2G(auto connect) but also slow in Vedio veiwing

"
"

  In the price range good product with available features.

"
"

  Iam Samsung fanI have 6 Samsung phones in my houseBest budget mobile phone, specially during such pandemicUsing from last 2 week, still not found any issue. Battery last whole day in single charge, camera quality is also awesome.Inshort I love this phone....

"
"

  For daily use and without gaming performance was good and smooth;Pros :Display qualityBatteryDesignSansung Brand( made in india)Cons :Little bit small size of displayFast chargingAverage camera

"
"

  Best phone with this price....Loved it a lot. I was worrying about the battery but it lasts for a day... Middle class can close their eyes and go for it... There is no finger print but battery life and camera quality is at the best... I have reviewed it after a month of usage...Honest review

"
"

  They say that this phone doesn't have a good battery life and not latest fast charging like those of Vivo or XIAMI but it is still great. I have experienced that it gets fully charged within 3hrs which ia good for students like us. The reason to like and buy it is simply that it is Samsung's product.

"
"

  Please don't buy this productSound system is soooooo badWhen we doing a videos sound will not recordNot worth of moneyEven now I don't have return options tooI lost my money by investing  on this mobile😔😔😔😔😔😔

"
"

  Product is good for daily use .a budget phone.good performance.camera is worst.front camera light is too low during videocallsGood for aged people

"
"

  Picture quality is not good. when you open the picture file in computer, the quality is bad.Charging takes more the 1hr to full charge.Signal quality is not up to the mark.

"
"

  Very bad productCamera quality is very low just like as 2 megapixel camera

"
"

  Just don't buy this mobile. After few days it's showing network problem. You can't make calls or recieve them,net is also not working. I took it to service center,they are saying to return the product but return period is over. 4G network is not detecting so you can't use Jio sim in it.

"
"

  The phone is extremely handy and small in size. Fits best in pocket. I feel Samsung should bring out smartphones with same screen size with enhanced memory and features such as AMOLED display and better camera. We are bored of carrying bigger phones. Samsung can really think about this.

"
"

  this mobile is very handy and light weight.carrying is very easy.very useful to middle age person.

"
"

  Fingerprints reader is very fast , Selfie and Photos of this phone is Awesome. Battery Life is too good. VALUE of money by Samasung M01. Very good product.

"
"

  Excellent Display and touch . Build Quality is awesome , far better than all Chines Mobiles ( RealMe & MI ).Good battery life of 1 day , ( normal use , avoiding heavy games )Can't expect every feature within this price .Overall , Samsung is best under 8k .

"
"

  Worth of money. A wonderful product for those who use smartphones for day today work. Picture quality is also good. maximum benefits in minimum price.However definately not for those who use smartphones for gaming.The price and performance of Samsung M01 is Worth of money.

"
"

  I have been a Samsung user throughout. All phones in my family are SAMSUNG  made. This phone is value for money priced at 9k. The best part is the size of the phone. Fits in my hand and is comfortable  to operate with one hand.  Very stylish as well. Has a decent processor.  Loved it.

"
"

  I am buy samsung m01 mobile1. After 3days mobile recharge adaptor not working.2. Delivered 13th sep 2020. Next 30th sep 2020. Battery decharged very fastly.3. Iam disapointed that Device.4. Camera also not good. Pictures are not clear.That's it.Ok

"
"

  The item was defective and instead of replacement, amazon did refund which I wasn’t looking for. I needed a replacement and now I will have to wait for delivery if other piece.

"
"

  Samsung n amazon dropped the price within one month and niether helped with even so much as a voucher. Not to mention samsung's after sales service is not better than micromax

"
"

  The mobile touch not working properly.It's taking around 5 hours to get fully charged.While recieving calls also facing lots of problems.As per Samsung Technical TeamThey asked to change phone immediately as a New Phone shouldn't  hang on its 1st day.

"
"

  The product from Samsung is good but with the same prize you can get better mobile with other brand.Camera quality is not too much good.Main problem with the charger it's taking 2.5 hrs to full charge which is more compare to other brands .I suggest  do not buy this product.

"
"

  Width of the display is lesser than the other mobiles of 5.7 inches due to which it seems small phone. Not happy with size of the display

"
"

  One of the worst camera phones, why would you buy it,becuse it's samsung? My mom's 2 yr old Xiaomi phone have better camera than this phone...highly add 2,3 thousand more and buy a better phone or burn the money you have but don't buy this phone

"
"

  1. Sleek, handy, tactfully pocket-sized2. Has everything packed in one nutshell3. Economic4. Reliable, moreover a golden touch from knox5. The one who doesn't show off but does the job6. Using the Red one.. never looks shabby

"
"

  Small in size, picture quality not good.

"
"

  Satisfactory starting range android phone. Battery is good as per screen size. Camera is good, performance fast due to 3GB ram. Overall happy. Gifted to mother... 😍

"
"

  No Fingerprint sensor is hard to digest, but will probably get used to. Face scan is not instantaneous. Other things are amazing. Loved Dolby Atmos. Samsung isn't including earphones these days that's somehow depressing.

"
"

  I give this to 4 star. In this price this is good phone, if you love samsung. Sound quality is good. Ui is android 10 that is awesome. But camera make you little bit disappointed. And one more thing that is not good in this phone is slow charging. Display is tft.

"
"

  It is good phone at 9000 and camera is also okay..but felt the is bit heavy.. delivery by Amazon was on time.

"
"

  Recently Gifted this phone to my father. It's perfect phone for the people who want a handy phone . he is enjoying while using this phone. Main thing he told is the perfect size.Performance wise the phone is good and got it on good price.

"
"

  It is good except i doubt, whether 4g is working in the phone. It only shows 2g and 3g.

"
"

  Faulty product. Charging is very poor. Taking more than 30 hours for full charge.

"
"

  Very good nice product battery life is awesome and processor is excellent in performance overall cameras selfie is good sound quality is very good and has Dolby Atmos but lack of fingerprint scanner and super amoled panel display size can be bigger and charging speed also

"
"

  I purchased for my dad and its fantastic. Awesome features in this price range. Absolute quality added by Samsung.However not satisfied with STPL and Amazon packing. Directly phone box put in to the Amazon plastic bag !!!

"
"

  Fingerprint sensor is not there but like this product. The critical star for this product is 1.4 but this is due to because it does have fingerprint sensor, takes 3:45 hrs. to complete charge.But if we can't see those things then the phone is very good and 5 stars.

"
"

  The phone dimension is very suited for one hand use. Body is plastic.Battry life is good. A medium user can last rheough the day with a single charge.However there is occasional lag.

"
"

  I bought this phone one week back. I have a problem with the mobile that some app closing automatically or some app opens automatically. Phone itself operates automatically.

"
"

  Didn't expected from a brand like samsung from last 15 year I was using samsung mobile but this time it's really very painful

"
"

  The product was as displayed in the discription. Delivered on time. Good for daily use.But the camera quality is not up to the level. Performance of the phone is great.

"
"

  The mic doesn't work and I guess the seller knew about it. The fellow should be blacklisted on amazon. I got to know about it a lot later since I had got it for my father and he said he had been using the speaker since day 1 to communicate. The return window is closed.

"
"

  Bought it @8400 deal for niece for virtual classes.It serves purpose with decent speed and memory.  Battery lasts for full day.  Nice camera at this price.Good budget phone with necessary features.  Face unlock is there but there is no finger print sensor.

"
"

  So froud work so small size and no return,And Amazon customer care service is also no copretive so dear friends not perches  in Amazon so bad mobile and Amazon customer care

"
"

  It's not worth mobile.requested for return after delivered mobile within 6hours .but no response from amzon and telling stories to take return .very disappointed.

"
"

  M01 does not have finger print scanner and only single camera which have very worst quality of camera. The discription given by amazon is not satisfying.

"
"

  Good

"
"

  The phone feels really good in the hand. Perfect fit. Its fast and has a good battery life, which last about two days. Camera needs improvement but otherwise a good phone for daily use.

"
"

  Very poor product. I want to refund and purchase another one. This handset is even not accepting in any exchange by Amazon or Flipkart

"
"

  nyc phone for simole use camera and speaker is not that much goodbut all over phine is good at this price.

"
"

  Very decent specs at this price point. 1000 times better than brands like vivo, oppo, Mi. 4000 mAh battery and infinity display at this price point is really amazing. Recommend this is to everyone looking at a price point of less than 9K.

"
"

  Nice product must buy if ur looking to buy under 9k thanks Amazon superfast delivery

"
"

  Samsung  is better to buy Chinese  product  this phone is good in this budget everything is good ..4.5 ratings outof 5..good made in india product

"
"

   I have received a faulty mobile. There is sound problem as well as app downloading problem also just within 5 days only after purchasing.After replacement also I got the same problematic mobile.

"
"

  This is something  beyond the review  I really appreciate  the work by the AMAZONhere they are really  changing  the INDIAN market when I ordered it in night  and got delivered by next morning also SAMSUNG  did a great job in budget friendly  smartphone

"
"

  Decent battery and performance. NOT FOR GAMING. Ordered for my mother for official work. So far gud. Good work samsung but work on your camera quality.

"
"

  Good backup phone. Love everything about the design at this price but for the position of the speaker vent. Sound quality could have been better.

"
"

  Normally low end Samsung gives poor output.I bought this one week ago.before I used redmi with same spec.comparatively very poor camera,clarity of screen,voice,processor speed.very low incoming voice .again disaster with Samsung mobile

"
"

  This phones suits just well in the price range of below 10k. It is handy as well as long lasting in case of battery. the screen of the device is pretty good and standard samsung screen. The only con i could feel in this device was no fingerprint.

"
"

  Niceeeee

"
"

  Good one to purchase with latest features at affordable price from Samsung with make in India .thank you

"
"

  No finger print feature..sound is very low while calling or listening to media files

"
"

  it is good product in less amount and the phone is in lite wieght so easy to carry and i had buyed it for online classes and now it is helpful to me thanks to amazon and samsung for releasing these product and amazon for fastest delivery in 3days thank you

"
"

  Battery drains very fast compared to my old one mobile too. Not a good product in this price. Can't recommend. Dont buy.

"
"

  This is an entry level smartphone of very good qualitySolid value for money

"
"

  Phone is very goodGood phone in this costNo finger print scanner but in this budget good battery life, good camera and good screen sizePhone is not sticking 3gb RAM is good

"
"

  Completely Dislike this Model. Need to return this but Amazon not taking back after a day of delivery. Very Bad performance and poor response getting from A big Brand. Really Disappointed. Pls replace my phone with another good option or refund my money.

"
"

  Best phone

"
"

  Good quality at that sigment. I was looking for Made in India Within 10k . And this is the best option I got in Amazon.

"
"

  I am giving this responce after 15 days using, i am not a gamer but have a app lover.Its an average phone with android 10 best part of it. Used as high app user without any lags best part of it.Overall a budget phone with needed requirement.

"
"

  I bought it first my mother they are facing difficulties with this produc chargingissue  and also volume issue  want to return it item by its past the warranty period 7 days it over by 14th and today is 19thKindly help

"
"

  Samsung m01 I bought this mobile on 7th sep .At the first time I checked my mobile incoming and outgoing calls it cut automatically itself. I registered compliant in Amazon. Don't buy this model (M01). Totally waste. I request you to refund my amount.

"
"

  Shelf life of samsung mobiles I an using are long lasting compared to Xioami or other Chinese product.  It is worth buying and better return of your money given the price it is best one.  I have been using samsung mobiles and liked interface and OS.

"
"

  This phone is worst in samsung phones. Camera quality is pathetic. Zero rating for camera. Packing of the mobile is poor. Charger quality is poor. Amazon doesn't take return. Its complete waste of money. Once you buy no help from amazon.

"
"

  Compact, sturdy and reliable phone ! Samsung's durability, feature set and reliability always stand strong. This phone is no exception. However, the top bar items are having very small fonts (eg battery % indicator)

"
"

  The phone is a very much handy and fulfills all the expectations in the mid budget category phone. There is only a small issue with speaker placed on the backside of the phone. Else it is worth a go.PS : Reviewed after a month of usage

"
"

  The product is good. Charging time takes not less than 3hours. It is not possible to charge in the urgent situation.. fast charging is not provided. Otherwise the product is good for nominal use.

"
"

  A Perfect Handset with standard size,lightweighted, fast and with no Hanging issue.Camera quality and battery life is also good.One should by this phone who is looking for mobile within 10000.

"
"

  I like very much, phone is super, Rear Camera quality is super front camera is ok Battery life super processor is super design super looking superPackeging damagedCharging lead not origionalOverall product and delivery fantastic

"
"

  With in budget under 10000 if you want to go for brand like samsung go for it...dont even give a second thought

"
"

  I have received a fault piece I guess, the phone is not getting charged more than 27% even after 1 hour charging from last 2 days.The return window is also closed now, it is really disappointing experience with this phone.

"
"

  Battery life is better. No fingerprint sensor, camera is ok for the mobile price cost.

"
"

  Its good product...  batary life extraordinary,  camera qualitu awasome,  charing time very little comparive other products..  in this pandamic it very useful for children to attending online classes...  thank you samsung..

"
"

  Phone was ok for only calls and watching youtube vedios. Good for surfing, chattingNot for games if you play games In it gets heated fast 🙂

"
"

  Phone is good overall to the basic user, but after one month usage I got charging socket problum I handed over to service station they said the particular fail item is not available in the service station. I am very much disappointed.

"
"

  Purchasing samsung phones for third time still not happy with the camera clarity which is very much dissapointing with poor quality.Said its monster battery but its draining fast as previous samsung models

"
"

  I got very bad quality charger with this mobile. The phone does not get charged in full night. It charged only 2% in full night. Very bad quality charger. I am very upset after purching this product.  Can samsung help me in this problem.

"
"

  Charging is slow due to the 1A slow charger otherwise the phone is very good, battery lasts for at least two days and a complete value of money. Plus, the Samsung OneUI is quite smooth and fast. I'm happy with this purchase so far.

"
"

  for dayle base use it is a very good phone. batt. last 2days. camera ok. there is one issue that is heating of phone

"
"

  I am buy this mobile for my mother,she is very happy and also very simple to use. Nice packed on time very good material received. Thank you Amazon 🙏

"
"

  Could've included connectivity of wifi 5 GHz

"
"

  Perfectly sealed package delivered! Item in good condition...just the way I expected it to be!

"
"

  The phone quality is worst as the day i put sim in it got blacked out  please check n buy from trusted ones i had to get into Samsung's service to repair it

"
"

  This mobile is very small don't go by the description of it as provided also they don't not have any return policy very much disappointed with Amazon

"
"

  phone is good but in the same range,  smartphone has many features, the screen size is small.

"
"

  waste of money ....i order this mobile and after a week Mic doesn't work....and it doesn't replaced by Amazon ...worste mobile ever...

"
"

  Product is very good at this price range.  I don't expect this kind of service from Amazon. Defected piece received and applied for replacement on 1st Sept,  till date dispatch of product not done.

"
"

  I got good exchange offer for my phone .I got rs 3000 off for my last phone mi. Overall phone is good . Picture quality I would rate 4 star, camera 3star.

"
"

  Liked overall function and battery life of the mobile. Best thing was getting a good useful mobile in very reasonable price. Happy to own the product. Worth the money...

"
"

  Product is the best but i am not satisfied with emi option becos not provided the t&C and cut the direct installations charged without information

"
"

  Best product in indian market as per indian people to full fill basic requirement in low budget.Front camera quality is slightly less required to improve it.also more time required to charg the battery as compared to other brand .

"
"

  Value for moneyAmazing phone by SAMSUNG in this price segment.M01 has crazy features and look really love the colours.

"
"

  I bought Samsung wall mount TV before two years. That time I refused to wall mount the TV but now it's required. Is it possible to provide the wall mount kit now

"
"

  Best Mobile below 10k range

"
"

  It is simply agenda mobile phone, you have a smartphone. camera normal, battery good but finger lock not found as per discription.

"
"

  It's a good phone for Rs8300 but I  thought that Samsung could have give a better processor  and a fingerprint sensor for the price they are charging.  For people who use their phone massively I don't recommend this phone .

"
"

  Very poor display and look very old phoneCustomer service not satisfied.  refund not available totally M01 phone very bad display and look 2years old phone refused not worth for mony not worth for single star

"
"

  Good product for the price. Only drawback does not have finger print reader

"
"

  Likes : Display, Touch, Call Quality, Look, Audio.Averge: Camera & processor.Dislike : Charger (Very Very Slow) & data cable is very short

"
"

  fast delivery by Amazon....and value for money product.battery life is good, fingerprint reader and camera quality is good...go for it.... budget product.

"
"

  Highly recommend this phone. The  performance is good with a pretty decent camera quality, the battery life is really the best, the handling was really good and it was really smooth. Value to money. Maybe the best phone under 10k.

"
"

  Samsung is now becoming the worst mobile company, I would have taken much better phone in 80340. Battery life is worst, camera quality is not so good, and phone heats up so fast. Battery drains very fastly. I am so disappointed 😡

"
"

  Mobile is good in this price range, and most important Samsung is Korean Company and Mobile is Manufacturing is in India.Go for this Mobile instead of China based companies Mobile

"
"

  This is a value for money phone. real good at this price point. excellent phone to use. Samsung brand value is much higher

"
"

  worldwide is a Samsung one – that's almost as good as Apple's figures and way ahead of anyone else in the market besides the big two. And considering Samsung's phones are well built, powerful and stylish, it's no surprise either.

"
"

  Good looking

"
"

  Med-budget phone .Good for normal use but gets  allot heated if heavily used.Battery life is ok as it is a med budget phone .Camera quality  is excellent .Overall it is a good phone for normal users.....

"
"

  Very good budget phone battery life lasts longer it has good processor average picture quality

"
"

  Dont go jsust don't go for any other product or brand. Camera waqq my button phone has better camera screen 720 p so not to go for this .if you want good phone then mi 9i may be good in this range

"
"

  Dolby atmos is not functioning. Youtube application doesn't work properly. All together there is no proper quality control. It not suggested product for someone who is expecting quality.

"
"

  Overall it is a good mobile but cannot find 4G option

"
"

  Very handy and perfect  size with good battery life and except gaming  app ,all apps are working fine . Camera  quality  is not bad as per the price. Voice quality  is also good.Overall, excellent  phone  in this  price.

"
"

  It works just well. Only the fingerprint scanner can be made better

"
"

  Front camera is not good. When we take a selfie with front camera it looks like artificial effect on the pic & when you zoom it pic will start to blur.

"
"

  It's good

"
"

  Pros:Nice build quality;Nice display;Light weight;Nice UI;Cons:Average camera,Average audio,No fingerprintBest for parents only

"
"

  The form foctor is great for one handed use. Display is of very good quality. For 8400 its a steal

"
"

  Screen flickering issue. After system update and hard reset (as suggested by customer service representative) it's the same. Now it is not even replaceable due to minimum stock.Please do not buy this phone.

"
"

  Basic feature like casting is not there ....Check before ordering

"
"

  Can't use it in the dark even at the lowest brightness.Little heavy for such a small size.

"
"

  The Phone was awesome...Best phone for online classes...best battery life..Front camera is awesome...🥰🥰I loved it.. it is aa best for normal use...phone display was awesome and amazing....

"
"

  I am very disappointed about breadth size.  But overall is good.

"
"

  Osm camera.... I had ever seen in this budget phone. Long battery life about 36hr.after full charging..finally mast mobile 👌😊

  Good battery life and smooth running phone, camera quality is cheap as it doesn't goes with the brand name, Samsung should have done better with camera, overall great phone, just missing the fingerprint sensor

"
"

  Touch is not working . I have buyed one month before only.. Samsung phones quality is so wrost . 4 Months before also I have buyed for my uncle . Even that mobile also same issue .. two mobiles gone

"
"

  It's really a nice phone the camera is pretty good at such price. Battery life is really good.  One thing I must tell you that it's not that a bad phone as negatively reviewed by lots of YouTubers.

"
"

  Battery is average. UI is also ok. To sum up all this good average mobile. Issue with heating while charging. This needs to be addressed.

"
"

  Ideal phone for normal user. Battery life is impressive. Screen brightness is very good. Software experience is top notch.

"
"

  Very helpful phone espically for student battery life is awesome my class goes for 4 hours after charching to 100% it just drain about 15% of battery.Not perfer for palying game rather than than best phone.

  एक नंबर का घटिया और बकवास मोबाइल है अमेजॉन कंपनी से मत खरीदना.

"
"

  Good smartphone.

"
"

  Great value for money. Right alternative for other Chinese brands

"
"

  Good budget phone but it is too small to carry and camera quality is cheap on both side(front+back), Speaker doesn't work properly sometimes, But Battery is Great in budget you can buy it for trusted brand

"
"

  I have ordered this phone phone for my father. Its almost 15 days and phone is working good. I would recommend this phone

"
"

"
"

  Good look, fast speed, and camera quality is good .Battery life is 24 hrs even after non stop usage .Ui is so interesting.Best deal in this price range from samsung.

"
"

  Satisfied

"
"

  I liked the whole mobile

"
"

  I purchased this product from Amazon ,from day one it is not working properly there is some hanging problem and auto speaking assistance working.Also Amazon not providing good service as compare to Flipkart

"
"

  Initial impressionA bit heavy, due to high density and thickness is high. Display is good but not great under direct sun, performance is what I will address in next edit of this review.

"
"

  Packaging was good.. im happy with the purchase and product.. ❤ camera quality is okay okayy..

"
"

  It's a really very good phone... In a worth price... Wonderfull service by samsung... 3 gb ram and 32 gb stoarage is enough in this price....Well done samsung👍

"
"

  Its gud product...in this price range..i am avoiding chinese made product...so this is gud .

"
"

  The battery life is satisfactory.At this price display is wonderful.The dimensions are perfect.I'm loving it.Recommended  to all those who want a quality smart phone at affordable price.

"
"

  Overall value for money, light weight, elegant design, good processor speed, battery life is good, camera average,I buy that because I'm not fan of big screen phones

"
"

  After 8 days only not working properly. Now I can not return this product. My Rs 8400 lost.

"
"

  Awesome phone by Samsung at this price range....camera quality and the video quality is the best in this phone.I bought it for my mother. Even the look of the phone is classy. The battery back up is also nice.

"
"

  Good battery life.No finger print sensorPoor camera qualityHigher priceFast processor

"
"

  Samsung M01 is nice mobile phone. Its very economical and with all essential features.

"
"

  The most thing i like with this phone that there is no heating issue. Great battery back up. Looks slim & attracting. Available on best price with amazon. I highly recommended to go with this phone.

"
"

  You r asking for rate the fingerprint reader but there is no such. The phone is all good except heating effect of phone after an hour of use.rest camera is just ok .. And phone is good to say just good ... Ok

"
"

  Good batteryGood processorGood displayBut camera is not upto the mark ☹️But value for money

"
"

  Excellent battery life and cheap and best smartphone.

"
"

  Don't buy this product,Because I brought this and 7 days later it switched off automatically and I pressed longly but it not oned and vibrant's unstoppableAmazon says all not thruth all faurd

"
"

  Decent phone bit in bulky and heavy side. Camera good, battery good and overall its upto the user to decide. To my opinion budget category phone with Samsung branding that's enough. 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏

"
"

  Battery lasts for more than 16 hours after charging only for once.Camera quality is just amazing.Samsung cameras are always the best.Fingerprint reader is the cherry on the top.

"
"

  It's good,one hand handling phone.I really like it. Thanks for the offer replacing my Nokia-2 . But it's smaller(5.5) then in that specifications,instead of 5.7 inch. Anyway it's good after all.

"
"

  This mobile good in this price but charging of this phone is very slow. Samsung is a good brand in mobile.

"
"

  Excellent product by Samsung battery life is very good awesome camera quality very good  totally it's very good product

"
"

  The Camera quality is very bad and the support I'm getting from Amazon it's not expected from Company like amazon

"
"

  Good phone for normal daily usage.Performance was good but cant play heavy games.Camera was average.Display is good.mobile is little bulky with case.

"
"

  Waste of Money there is no fingerprint sensor available but shown in technical specifications.Too thick phone don't go for it they r cheating

"
"

  phone was  heating,charging time very long 4 hrs to  full, camera ok average,i  buy this phone only one reason this is a non chineese, make in  india phone, battry backup not  very good as desire.

"
"

  Produt is good but dont buy it through Amazon because return/replacement policies are not clear in online shopping portal. Many more things comes to know about return/replacement polocy after shopping..

"
"

  I will I could give a zero but I can't. The phone was not working from the one. Amazon didn't replace or refund my money. The phone was fixed but still has problems. I don't recommend buying this phone.

"
"

  Battery life is good. Easy to handle and fits in hands... little bit expensive...600 rs dropped just after bought by me...is there any way to get my 600 back.... overall good buy....

"
"

  Very good phone because of it's compact size ,no lag is seen in day to day usage , battery last for 24hrs in moderate usage. Overall best phone if anyone for alternative for Xiaomi and realme

"
"

  Network is not good and video also when we do video call. Unable to here other voice.Worst performance and quality was not good.Don't buy this phone worst quality.

"
"

  It’s good product. Specially value for money. This is manufacturing in India (I love that) designed by sumsung. No handing screen.

"
"

  Camera quality is very good in day light but not so efficient in tube light. Battery life is also very good. There is no button in drop down menu for screen-shot.

"
"

  It's really a nice phone actually I bought it for my wife after a long time I replaced her old mobile with this one and this time she is very happy and showing more love towards me

"
"

  4G signal strength and speaker also not good. Average cell phone.

"
"

  Product is good but Fingerprint security is not avlable in handset.

"
"

  Suitable for middle income group

"
"

  Camera is reasonably good. Battery life and user interface is good.Best in the price range.The device has no fingerprint reader.  Not advisable for games and extensive media users.

"
"

  Truly economical

"
"

  Nice phone at this price point, but the only concern is that it supports lte and not volte.

"
"

  One of the third class mobile phone, once it will be dropped from your hand, and its glass will be breaked.  Don't buy Samsung Galaxy smartphones,  one of the cheapest quality smartphones

"
"

  Overall a good phone in the price. Samsung should provide fast charging now with basic phones as well

"
"

  I used this phone from last few day's. A battery of this phone is good enough for daily usage. Camera quality is not that adequate, its average. No fingerprint, face unlocks is poor.

"
"

  This mobile value for money. It is worth to take. The battery life is good and camera quality is best. If anyone looking for mobile within the range of 9000 rupees I happily recommend this mobile.

"
"

  Ordered this for my mom who is not an ardent user of her phone and this was the right choice with an easy to use interface and good battery back up. Also,  the packaging was really good!

"
"

  Getting calls disconnected often

"
"

  Awesome product at this price.

"
"

  Average performance,.. fast battery drain,.. lengthy 4.5 hours of charging time,.. 10-15hrs of battery backup .. whatevwr else, problems are not many but battery life matters..

"
"

  I was having a 1GB mobile. Now with Samsung quality and 3GB mobile , it is amazing. Very Happy

"
"

  Product is fine .But the delivery experience was the worst. I would recommend other online shopping sites for proper delivery. Amazon is certainly below par. Really disappointed with the delivery

"
"

  Battery life is great.  Easily 24 hours wide heavy usage. The most important is it's compact size.  Very easy with single hand and easy in pocket also.  Light weight and sturdy innhands

"
"

  Best entry level phone from Samsung.  Good battery life. Build quality is good. Worth every penny  paid. We have exchanged old mobile and got good discount .

"
"

  Good for normal internet browsing messaging and youtube usage. Light weight and camera could have been betterBut most importantly it's not Chinese made

"
"

  Phone is getting heated and amazon is not helping properly in replacing the item.. Very much disappointed

"
"

  The phone is little heavy but have awesome features, touch and camera quality is really good 👍👍👍

"
"

  Excellent smartphone at this price

"
"

  Always a best product from Samsung. Looks like very advanced in face lock.Battery life is awesome. And camera is very sharp.  Very good value for money. I recommend this product.

"
"

  Very worst product  don't purchase I am facing alot of problem ,Amazon sell more product with third party which are very bad in term of quality please  avoided to purchase this mobile.

"
"

  When I receive or make a call, it is disconnecting after one minute. Really frustrating. hHow samsung make mobile like this?

"
"

  This is an amazing phn in this price range..... Absolutely no lags..... Display is damn awesome  and its absolutely handy..... the blue variant looks really premium..... very smooth device.....

"
"

  Very slow processing and battery backup very bad charger and data cable not good quality.  I want to return but not accept by Amazon.  This item is like a duplicate or replaced not an original.

"
"

  dont waste ur  money by purchasing this type of worst products, worst camera and people cant hear the phone call . i from now onwards i will not purchase any samsung product

"
"

  Screen quality is top notch. Battery life is a little bad. For day to day usage it's fine. Call quality is good. Phone is fast enough. Highly recommended budget phone for non-gamers.

"
"

  No yet all recommended. Poor audio or speaker quality. Charging taking too much time. Before purchasing, I thought that Samsung might of improved the product. But the product is almost waste.

"
"

  One of the good product from SAMSUNG in budget segment. I am using this cell phone from last 2 months without any issue. If you have budget under Rs.10k then you can go ahead with this model.

"
"

  Good mobile but size too small

"
"

  I buyed this for my mom and its good for the normal tasks but if u r buying for PUBG so dont buy it and camera quality is also not so good just ok okThis is a perfect phone for parents

"
"

  Good product for daily usage at this price point. Getting one UI on basic smartphone is amazing

"
"

  Best budget phone... Apart from Camera overall performance is good...Go for Samsung brand, Instead of fake configuration by rest.

"
"

  I have added total protection for Rs.349 but it not appliedPlease bdo the needful...

"
"

  Earphone not received with mobile.....not satisfied with Samsung giving this type of service

"
"

  I bought M01 for my dad. Since it has 4000mah battery it's stands all day for him to watch youtube videos. It's lot more easy to use than China phones.

"
"

  Front camera is ok. Back camera is not up to mark. Screen share option of Samsung is not available in this model is another draw back.

"
"

  I MISS SUPER AMOLED DISPLAY ON THIS SAMSUNG GALAXY M01.YOU GET TFT DISPLAY ON THIS M01 SMARTPHONE.OVERALL GOOD

"
"

  After software upgrade phone not recognising the SIM card both in Sim 1 & 2

"
"

  The phone is very small in size. Camera quality not upto the mark. A very big disappointment.They don't even give a return policy. I am not satisfy with the size of the phone. Poor.

"
"

  Good phone at this price. Please go for it

"
"

  One of the best budget phones available under 8K. I was a bit sceptical about buying it as the company Tecno isn't known in India but to my surprise it is exceptionally well made.ProsBattery Life - 6000mah Easily lasts two daysScreen - 7"" inch screen for viewing videos and movies (Helpful for my mother as she struggles with small fonts while reading or typing)Two SIM slot and dedicated Micro SD slotCamera - 13Mp Rear Triple camera and 8mp front camera with dual flashAndroid 10 (Go version) - Up to date android with Go version for a seamless useConsRam - It is only available in 2GB and 32GB internal storage variant which the company should reconsider. Do not expect playing high end games. PUBG LITE runs with minor glitches during gameplaySound - Speaker output quality isn't upto the mark while playing videos and music but manageable.Would definitely recommend this phone if you're looking to buy something under 8k or a back-up phone to watch movies & web series.Thank you Amazon & Tecno :)

"
"

  Value for money. I really wanted make an economical choice between phone and tablet. Glad that I am getting all tablet benefits with extra battery in a phone like this. It serve my purpose to browse online watch online content, study n enjoy music on mobile network. The phone is little heavy but if I had bought tablet it would have been bulky as well. At least it's not as heavy as a tablet but gives all benefits of tablet as well as phone.

"
"

  Easily the best specifications at 7999.Was planning to get Spark Power 2.But, this is a much better value for money - 7"" screen, 13 MP triple cam and 6000 Mah Battery! Loving this.

  all the specs sheet is loaded to attract the customer . looks like lucrative deal but the device is average and definitely remind you that it is cheap chinese phone. Even no cover is sold for this model anywhere in any website, neither provided in box . Its better to buy narzo 10A or realme C12  instead of this.dont fall prey for tripple camera. Only usable camera is 13 MP ( I mean to say bokeh is not good and i dont know for what third 2mp camera is ??? its just a gimmick). there is no dedicated speaker and earpiece works as speaker and it sounds like screaming noise when you play louder.In my view only plus point of this phone is it has 7 inch screen which is good for vedio and movie viewing experience)i bought this @ effective cost of 7200 with card offer so i can say its okay for money i paid. but if have to buy @ 7999 you have lot of better options

"
"

  Friends don't buy this phone and never buy anothing again in amazon. Amazon provides very very bad customer service. I buy Tecno spark 6 air mobile on Amazon . After 2 days the charging cable not working. Plz don't buy this phone.

  After almost a week of using this phone my review is, Great build quality, battery can last easily a full day, great for students who are planning to buy a device for online classes and for studying in a tight budget, the phone doesn't lags or hangs unless you put too much stress on the phone, camera is amazing i can i see the a.i camera doing it's magic, stabilization in video is not very good, front camera is kind of disappointing for me it takes time to perfectly focus if you are taking some creative shots something like that, if you move a little bit also even an slight adjustments, very slight, while using the front camera the picture is just straight bad, i have used many phones and in them it's not the caseIt has bloatwares and stuff which u can't really uninstall for the majority, but some can be uninstalled and some can be disabled, majority of them, still not a great number of bloatwares but still a significant amount, the screen is great it's a big screen so it will take some time to get used to it, if you are not used to big screen phones or tablets or have never used it, screen is sometimes a bit laggy or unresponsive but i have seen that In many devices so that's a normal thing in ips lcd hd+ displays, picture quality is good, i guess a Little too sharp but again that to i have seen and used in many smartphones so if you have used something like that before you are good to go, and also it's a little contrasty when you're watching  some dark or not very bright videos like mostly the background is dark but not like watching sky at night, some video like that, not much of a issue, it also depends on the video also, the quality it has, that's not much of an issue but you should know that as a buyer, battery is great very useful for students and business personnelSo Pros:-BatteryRear Camera, 4 flash and front dual because screen flash sucks not a fanDisplay size and quality at this price is fair, i.e., hd+You get a case with plastic, screen or scratch guard onFingerprint scanner is fast and so the face unlock but in dark it is a little slow or sometimes doesn't work at all but in noticeably dark conditionsProcessor is fair plus the ram romIt has a25 octa core not p22 as shown in Cpu-Z  or any other app it's gpu is same in p22 and a22(which is a quad core so no way it's in this device as it has an octa core processor) and also the processor can go max up to 1.8ghz which only a25 does, rest have much higher clock speedCons:-Display sometimes is unresponsiveFront camera not a fanThe back panel is a little squishy or it gets pressed a little bit I don't know it's a flaw or just something they did willingly, but not a problem, it won't make any sound or you'll even notice it until you press itTHE PHONE KILLS THE APP THAT'S SADIT HAS A RATING OF 5 IN, DON'T KILL MY APPS, APPLICATIONAND IT'S MICRO INTELLIGENT THING CAN ANNOY YOU SO TURN IT OFF, BASICALLY WHAT IT DOES IT WHEN YOUR PHONE IS IN SLEEP AND IF YOU MOVE IT OR SHAKE IT A LITTLE BIT ALSO THE SCREEN GETS ON THAT'S SO ANNOYING AND USING A FLASH WITH THAT SETTING ON WHILE THE SCREEN IS OFF TURNS IT OFF AND AMBIENT MODE OF GOOGLE IS GOOD YOU CAN USE IT BUT SOMETIMES THAT TO GETS ANNOYINGDOESN'T HAVE A NOTIFICATION INDICATER JUST A LITTLE FRONT FLASH WHEN IT'S ON CHARGING

  Product is average...I write this review after five days use...Rear Camera is Good but front Camera is wrost. Only one thing is good with this product is its Battery ...back up is excellent. The most wrost is....it's Cover is not available at Amazon ...and also not available in any other online platform...it's just horrible....it's the moral responsible of Amazon to sell the Cover . Using with out cover is always risk of slipping from Hand and damage....So I request to the Team Amazon to arrange it's cover on priority

"
"

  Simply the best phone in this price range one can get ....look wise it’s premium brand no one will believe it’s so cheap .

"
"

  Screen size is big (7 inch) and pixel resolution is good, so, it feels like a tab or kindle to read. But the day I purchased itself I observed some major software issue that did not allow me to absolutely download any Apps from the Google Playstore. I had to apply for replacement the very same day I received delivery.

"
"

  Phone speaker is very bad.phone only good for battery.Request customer not to buy.No earphones,no phone case,no tempered glass.most importantly non refundable.overall below average quality

"
"

  If you are spending 8,499 for this device, it is absolutely pennywise worth.You can find many negative reviews for this phone, but ignore all if you have a budget constraint.@8,499 no phone gives you 7"" supercool screen@8,499 no phone give you so many camera features (Though Primary camera is only 13MP & you can't compare it with other 48MP or 64MP camera high-end phone, as you paid only 8499)@8,499 no phone gives you 6,000 MH battery with Andriod10@ 8,499 no phone gives you almost a tab like experience@ 8,499 no phone gives you such a premium look & finish& Many more.

"
"

  Every thing 60% ok plese arrange for silicon cover or any cover for this 7"" display mobile please take step M/S AMAZON or TECHNO mobile manufacturers ++++ next model when introduce TECNO SPARK 7+ ,,,make everything  same look 4gb ram 128 GB rom price should  be below 11000 and improve the camera and processor  as per your  technical  people deciding

"

  This is the first time I'm writing a review because I'm very upset with Amazon and Techno brand.This phone has Plastic body, display is not satisfying.Battery take 4_5 hours to charge.No fast charging feature is available.Built quality could be better.Battery drains very rapidly.Phone use to get heated very frequently.Total waste of money.So i would not recommend people to go for Techno brand phones. I would prefer to go for Realme, redmi, or vivo. In the same amount i.e. 8k, you may get better quality product.I'm very disappointed with this product. Also i tried to replace this product but the product wasn't replaced. Very bad service.

  The box is clearly stating free bluetooth earphone but received without earphone.

  I had ordered for a techno spark 6 air phone on 12 September at amazon.I got my order on 13 September. I found some  problem in its touch after just one day. I reported it at amazon customer care  on 16 September and I was assured to send technician at my home on 19 September but no one came at scheduled time.then I scheduled another technician he assured as that it will be return.then I contact to the customer care they said your time line is ended.Today it became dead inspite of over 80% battery and it started by plugging it in charging.  I am suffering from my defected phone which is causing too much irritation .

"

  Display is not stable.... Poor quality dispaly....scrambling

"
"

  Little bit upset during unboxing that they dont provide any headphones along with mobile. They only provide charger.

"
"

  Absolutely useless for any marginal Android user. Phone frequently strucks. Apps don't function properly. Amazon sells it with restricted return policy. In which one would never end up succeeding. Many features available in other similar range mobiles are missing. Dual app, scroll screenshot, etc. doesn't exist. Good for Grand parents.

"
"

  This's a worth buying phone but this smartphone's camera is not discent what I expected here is so many add and malvare that is PRe installed app on this phone you should look for other phone.i bought it one month ago ,it's charging adapter is not working . Battery is dissent but charger is rude

"
"

  The phone came with the charger that did not work on the first day itself ... I've tried to return but they kept postponing it saying they'll fix it ... They sent another piece ... The new charger and phone they've sent worked for exactly 10 and done.. !! What are phones and chargers for? To work for 10 days ? I shouldn't have ordered in the first place... The worst ever experience.

"
"

  It's price must be 6999..Advantages.:1) battery 2) large display.DisAdv: 1) camera quality is not good2) Not at all a good speaker3) Display quality is not enough.4)low storage capacity.. atleast 3gb is needed at this cost..old processor too...(helio p22)(Need Advanced2.3 GHz at this price)5) heavy weight6)Non availability of tempered glass and back cover in the market Anyhow Tecno try it in your next version

"

  WorstBad mobile

"
"

  Been using the phone from last 4 days no big issues except in very rare moments because of 2 gb ram the phone lags but it happens almost like none , and for battery it gave me the best battery life which I have used in a smartphone from 96% of charge till 0% it took 17-18 hrs (including really heavy usage) though it does take time to charge maybe 3.5 hrs or soWell if you are a very light gamer or just an average user I would recommend this phone rather than other brands because in the end we just have to use insta , whatsapp and YouTube

"
"

  Good 😁😁😁except camera is not at par overall good .not superb

"
"

  One of the worst product...Touch responce is not so good..Charging speed is very slow ( charge 26% in a hour)Front camera is like a 1 mega pixel camera... Only blurry pic can be clicked..And the didn't provide the freebies.The UI is not so good unable to find many setting..Just a waste of money

"
"

  Camera is Average. Good for basic users.Pros:1)  Display2) Baterry (slow charging)Cons1) 2GB Ram2) Amazon UPI is not supported for this OS3) Software issues needs to clear cache and data  for installing new apps in play Store4) Back cover and Tempered glass5) Speaker quality is very low. (Not much difference in normal and loud speaker while calling)You can buy this mobile when you are not able to buy Narzo10A, redmi9 prime and some mobiles in flash sale.

"
"

  Hi Team,All mobile company are turning back to Stone age now-a-days,Point 1 :  8000 rs mobile price & only charger included, this days no headsets placed in New Mobile kits( at-least 300 rs headsets would be better)Point 2 : Color difference wary from Amazon website & original piece.Point 3 : Camera quality is  average (3 camera on backside is useless until you have HD photos)Point 4 : Past one week trying hard to get mobile accessories like Mobile Back Case & Temper Glass but Couldn't able to find one since this is 7'inch display mobile, fed upPoint 5 : for 8000 rs good Mobile in low price for kids better than Tab and Received mobile on time deliverThanks to Amazon & Team

"
"

  Cannot use amazon pay upi, is this worst mobile, or worst Amazon app developer??

"
"

  Nice mobile... New features and fabulous and camera is the best one clear and hd pics

"
"

  Bought its at about 7k ....probably best phone anyone could have at this price,brilliant battery smooth screen and camera quality is also ok(as expected not very good)...rest thought 7inch would be difficult to handle but it wasn't the case ...slim design offers a better grip on phoneFace unclock works brilliantly but fingerprint sensor takes a little time about 1sec...rest everything is close to perfectMust buy

"
"

  Sound is worst.. if u want to buy a tab this one is ok..Otherwise totally loss ur money

"
"

  They spy on your data please be aware of this. Its very bad.

"
"

  Tempered glass and back cover needed badly help

"
"

  I have been sold a defective items, Amazon not agree to replace the product

"
"

  Cons:1. Large battery makes the phone heavy. So while playing games, hand pains2. If you want to search any old SMS, you cannot.3. No split screen available (Youtube & Whatsapp in same screen). This is a basic android functionality available in my 2 year old phone.4. Phone slightly lags when playing heavy gamesPros:1. Battery easily lasts for 2 day for normal usage (Facebook + whatsapp + browsing)2. Latest Android version (Android 10)

"
"

  Very affordable and nice specifications,good looking,nice camera.And see If you are techno music lover like me,then buy this brand.This smartphone is good and sexy.It’s a must buy,If you are looking for a change.This phone is good.

"

  Have been using Tecno phones in Africa in the past, brand was no surprise for me. What I found about phone after 7 days of use -->1. Successful to catch network in low signal areas . This is special because around the place I live, network signals fluctuate too much. Mike is better than other phones . (Tecno users know this well)2. Selfie camera is better than many branded phones, and that's what needed today for video conferencing. Dual flash gives presentable snaps in evenings and night times.3.  Display does its job if you are not ardent game player. For my son's video tutorials and Youtube it works well.4. Watching movies is pleasurable experience with long battery life at least we are sure of uninterrupted entertainment.5. Speaker is ordinary, but latching on to blue-tooth speakers hides its weakness.6. Lack of quality accessories in market is not so much devil, got a basic flip cover for fall protection.Overall it is moneysaver and also substitute for tablet , what is needed for the day. 5 star and recommended!

"
"

  The main drawback is ear piece works as loudspeaker and the sound is very annoying. No back cover is supplied with the phone. However with 2gb ram it's performance is very good. It's never lags with Android go edition. Good for multimedia and social networks. No fast charge it took almost 5+ hours to charge from 0 to 100%. I think spark power 2 is better option then this. Pls consider these points before purchasing this piece of crap.

"
"

  We encountered with following issues with this phone till now.Screen becomes black while calling or working on the phone or unlocking the phone it became unresponsive.Fingerprint sensor does not work at all. I registered 4 fingerprint of the same finger still it does not detect it.The speaker was sound flattened.Max FPS is told as 30 but it goes max to 3 only.It constamtly Hangs and does not responce.CPU is slow.Because of all above issues, we tested this phone with few performance tools and found it has many other problems likeProcesser graph is continously under the red mark.Here are the few test tools we used to test this phone. Most of the tools are suggested by CNET.AI BenchmarkSeascapeGeekbench 5CPU-Z3DMarkSystem Info DroidFPS Test 3DPiarate Ship BenchmarkAnTuTu BenchmarkPCMarkGFXBench BenchmarkGPU Mark - BenchmarkReal Pi Benchmrk

"
"

  Big mobile for 8000 rs, display, tocuh and speed is good for a 2gb ram mobile. Its more than enough for non gamers. I am using this mobile for watching videos and other uses.

"
"

  Super phone(Tecno spark 6 air) its battery life is long lasting for 3 days1 problem is that u forgot to check the size of the diaplay and when it reached it is a big phone so it is not suitable for my pocket so i decided to return it but amazon say that it is a electronic product and there is no return there is only request for a replacement only. Then i give this phone to my wife. Overoll super phone, long battery(6000 mah)big display, super rear camera and rear flash like a DSLR flash, front 8mp super camera and it has only 2gb ram and 32gb storage. I like this phone very much. Only problem is when this phone become complaint what will i do??I offer you to purchase this phone when you are searching for a budget phone under 10000₹Thank you

"
"

  i am writing this review after a days use. hope it continues to work as sameThis phone Specification are Minimum but this enough for watching videos and other normal calls and whatsapp and low graphic games. I bought it for my Kid for online classes it works well.7"" inch Screen + Battery backup highlight of the phone.  Looks wise also good.Value  for Money

"
"

  Very Nice phone with big battery and display.Speaker give poor quality but other thing is OK .we hope that in new update will improve speaker quality.

"
"

"
"

  The camera is awesome with 13mp ,and battery is efficient from full charge a person can play pubg 8-9hours.and good phone under 8000.i liked it's 7notch display  alot. It is good for studying students where you get more feature in affordable money. It is not a gaming phone but still you can play lite weighted games such as pubg lite. I would prefer this a lot

"
"

  Very Nice phone camera ,fingerprint reader ,battery photos and overall very best phone in medium value .Value for money . Apart this Thank you amazon I loved your services . Always fulfilment and timely delivered .

"

But since the day I got in  my hand it given me full satisfaction.. a superb phone in reasonable price.big battery and big display is it's uspBut camera quality is also good.. performance is fantastic.. . So I will suggest to buy it without any doubt.And thanks to amazon and it's associate sellar for such fast delivery.

"
"

  Techno Spark meets my ALL Expectations!! A large HD Display with long battery life, I can watch movies, videos for hours. All other functions are Very smooth operating. Cameras are Okay. A bit heavy phone, due to its powerful battery. No lagging, I just love this smart phone got in exchange with my Samsung A10. ♥️♥️♥️👌🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟

"
"

  Good Budget Phone for having video call with elder people who may struggle to view video over video calls. with it huge screen size at budget range would be help full. Tecno a sister concern of Infinix mobiles features some amazing for mobile users who want have huge screen size, Marathon battery

"
"

  This item was amazing and it has a great camera optionals. They gave charging adapter and wire.They gave the back phone case too.And then they gave insert pin. Its touch screen was very very smooth.I loved this phone very much.

"
"

  Battery is too good.This is best phone in 7999...All things are okk...

"
"

  Overall a good phone in this budget.The sound quality is poor.perfromance of battery is good.Camera is decent with other same budget mobiles.Only issues I faced is there is no proper accessories like tempered glass, mobile cases for this mobile.

"
"

  * Camera quality :- its ok in this price range.*Thickness is good .*Size 7"" not bad it's comfortable in hand for reading or attend online classes watching videos.Battery backup nice I can used full day online watching videos in single charge.but it's take long time to charge 45% in 2 hours with out use in changing.No back cover and screen guard in local market or online.

"
"

  Purchased for my mom as she required big fonts  and screen as well good sound.Screen resolution is also good for viewing videos.Very good quality earphone and sound also good, so seamless with calls.Battery capacity huge and runs for 2+ days.Just have to uninstall/ delete some of the inbuilt apps and disable notification which were useless.

"
"

  This is a magnificent smartphone which comes under only 8K range.It facilitates with a large battery  which can ensure us with a superb performance after charging.It can easily last for two days for normal users like me.It also enhances the camera quality with both rear and front which can provide a outstanding performance in the camera part while I am taking photography with this phone.

"
"

  Sound is OK Kind,, not goodCamera OkBut still if you have low budget and want to carry good looking BIG Size mobileTHIS mobile you can buy

"
"

  Poor sound quality and poor camera quality. It's not a gaming smartphone.

"
"

  This is an incredible phone at very least price . I am quit impressed with it's smooth performance . And the mobile do not have any problem if you play freefire because phone master is there to remove the excess capcha .Thanks to Amazon for their wonderful exchange policy.

"
"

  Super Duper phone by Tecno. Camera Average but battery 2 days in one single full charging. Thank you Amazon for speedy and fast delivery before 3 days from Estimated delivery date.

"
"

  After using for 10days  I am really happy with the performance of the phone.  7"" screen great for online videos. Screen quality is ok. RAM should be minimum 3gb. Camera quality is ok.  At a price below 8k it is a good choice. Till now no issues.

"
"

   It's value for money good phone am writing this review after useing phone for more then one weak

"
"

  Phone looks good. Screen is beautiful to watch. Its big. Too many junk apps which I disabled. Ads can be seen. But watch youtube videos to stop them. Battery is outstanding. Audio quality is not good. For day to day use I didn't find any lag. May be its new that's why. I hope it will run good. The best feature is the freezer option. Do use it.

"
"

  ये पीस अच्छा है लेकिन सेल्लेर बदमाश है।उसने ब्लूटूथ खुद रख लिया।ज्यो मोबाइल के साथ फ्री हैऔर रेट भी ज्यादा लगाया

"
"

  The mobile looks very good and the weight of the mobile is also very low. You take the mobile after seeing the review, at this price, the mobile is very great, you will get absolutely great feeling in the mobile, so my opinion is that if you have to take a good battery sound backup and a mobile  This mobile is the best with a good quality camera.

"
"

  Phone looks decent, processor is little bit old but it can handle day today tasks very efficiently, it can handle light games. Display is very nice compared with this price point and the camera too. Phone comes with pre-installed apps which can be disabled.To get better performance disable all the unwanted apps other than Google apps.

"
"

  Tecno Spark air 6 fone is very good for this price segment. Bettery is most like in this phone but rear camera quality is specifically video recording is very poor. Otherwise phone and price good.

"
"

  Not value  for money  camera is very bad and laeg  MTK A22 🔋 is good undar 8k not value for money other phone recommend don't purchase lag Device

"
"

  Plz don't buy this phone is very very waste and don't purchase on amazon is waste . New phone will be not working

"
"

  Display - goodTouch response - goodbattery -  ExcellentRear Camera - GoodFront Camera with dual flash - GoodOverall good product for the normal beginner user with this price segment

"
"

  The mobile is worth, we can't expect more in this price, big 7 inch screen and 6000mph battery is ideal for watching videos

"
"

  I just want 2 mention it's an awesome, worth every penny , ri8 price ... Everything was amazing regarding this phone... Thanks Amazon nd team members....

"
"

  The only cons of buying this phone is that back cover is not available online or at local market . And it is also definite that the 7.0 inch phone will be valued zero if got slipped from your hands

"
"

  Camera quality is not best but is good for normal photo shot.Front 2 flash light.7 inch dispalay soo awesome felling, and easy do handing .Battery backup is awesome quality.. 6000mAh..really good response.For normal use that phone is value of money.for parents use.

"
"

  Firstly it's not working properly and even amazon UPI id not work completly. Below 8000 valu for money is battery and large display..it works the old version of amazon and not updating new version..

"
"

  Good in budget segment.camera is OK.battery give full day backup.support only smooth and normal graphics for pung.some lags when I used after 3 hours.if you are looking for best budget segment you can buy it.it only worst 8500.you don't buy even 1rs extra

"
"

  Phone is good in this price range but it has a problem that's it's charger is not good to charge the mobile it takes a lot of timeBut it is not a big problem in my opinionPhone is good under 8,000.If you want a big display and big battery then you should be buy it.

"
"

  Very poor

"
"

  This mobile phone is superb for who don't more money  to buy high quality phone. This is really low budget phone  with superb battery, camera, size,etc features. Really I want suggest this phone to buy user who don't have more money or lack of economic conditions.

"
"

  mobile is good in mid range, but seller its mrp 10490 with Bluetooth earpiece but seller don't send bluetooth earpiece. And amazon customer care is helpless. Happy with mobile but disappointed by amazon service. Its a loss of  rs. 799 bcoz amazon unable to resolve my issue.

"
"

  Good battery backup , camera quality excellent in daylight. So if  you looking for a low budget ph with some features take it. Ex cept the main problem of this ph is it is big for your hand to carry or in your  litttle pocket. Otherwise it is somoth fast for every thing you need।

"
"

  Good for viewing Videos and Multimedia as it has good big Screen and big Battery, other than that don't expect much, you can use daily apps effortlessly, multitasking is good enough, high resolution games total no no..

"
"

  Sound is low and all others are good in condition. Waiting for other fault if anything.It became fault and not working properly.It sees shivering & jerking while it opening.what  a stupid product.I want to return it for either repair or replace at once

"
"

  Tecno spark 6air is a good phone .I purchased it for my younger daughter. +2 student. She likes it very much. Using for her online classes. She is very happy.

"
"

  I think this good phone below 8000. Screen is awesome. Battery is great. But some issues that ram is only 2 GB . 1 GB ram for inbuilt apps. We only got 1 GB. So I hope they indroduce 3Gb ram phone. 32 GB rom is good. Processor want more improvement. Totally this is good phone

"
"

  Fingerprint reader ,battery life is good but camera is not the value of money, but product is very good , please buy this phone, only study purpose, not any other purpose, other purpose please buy Tecno phone 8500 rs , thanks for amazon. ,and delivery boy

"
"

  Mobile speaker was not upto mark when given to service station damaged charging point this is paid product if within 2 months your mobile mother board is damaged what need to do bad product Amazon don't make fool by selling such bad products

"
"

  A big battery phone with big display in a reasonable price. Really a good choice to purchase this mobile.

"
"

  Value fr money don't believe negative reviews,u cannot buy iphone for 8000rs

"
"

  On the box it is mentioned clearly that free bluetooth earpiece but not there

"
"

  It has high noise issue in background while recording video

"
"

  Very good.....I like this product very much....this is very useful product to me...OK thanks....good...very well...

"
"

  Value for money although camera quality is a little poor and memory is low. But definitely the best one in market at this price.

"
"

  Overall this mobile look and feel is really good. no problem yet. wonderfull product for this price

"
"

  Techno phones are really nice.happy with my purchase.

"
"

  Only Screen size and battery life is good.The camera video recording is too noisy and the Images also not up to mark.After purchasing this phone I regret my self.

"
"

  Nice product. Camera and battery both very good performance

"
"

  That's a Great phone don't underestimate it it's a really good in comparison of Oppo real me redimi or else brand.. This will take over all brands.. Use n then see its all task importance... Thanks

"
"

  It's amazing meBeautiful mobile but little bit length of 7""Good camera dual flashMammoth battery it's 12+12 hours with 2days using net one chargeFree back coverFree temper classes

"
"

  Sound quality of the phone is pathetic. And performance is also lagging to the major level

"
"

  Camera, sound and video quality not good. Thumbs down

"
"

  Mobile is great, 7 inch screen & 6000 MAH battery, thumps up but phone gets thumps down on 2 GB of RAM, believe me very less

"
"

  Best phone you will ever find. If you found this phone 'CONGRATS'. I would totally suggest you buy this phone.

"
"

  One of the worst products i have bought..After 2. I will get Off due to Black creen Due to Mother board issue..I really told you that you guys dont buy this product.Infact dont buy tecno product

"
"

  Small Amount big battery thanks for Amazon

"
"

  Good Budget phone in this price. 6000 battery is meaningless, will works like 4000 MAh only. Photo quality is excellent for this price range. Looks little bulky. Good build quality

"
"

  Superb battery,amazing selfie camera, big screen, amazing sound quality.Overall nice performance in a very affordable price.

"
"

  Nice ,excellent,economical. Mobile @7999Thanks to Amazon ,Nice service.

"
"

  The product is average. However, the speaker is not satisfying at all. Tecno should have given a better speaker. A separate one, Such as a back speaker or grilled one.

"
"

  Pros:Massive screen, 6000mah battery, 3gb ram, 64 gb storageCons:Speaker is below averageOverall good deal for the price. Not for gamers just to mention here.

"
"

   super  phone worth for money

"
"

  Great product awesome battery life and camera performance is far better than in this price range product.

"
"

  Camera quality is average not bad not supper , I can't say value for money because I doesn't come with earphone

"
"

  Thanks Amazon for delivery of this item. It's superb mobile, after using for a week I must say that this is best mobile in this cost. Thanks again.

"
"

  Good mobile in this price Range .👍 But Amazon didn't provide me back cover which was included! Disappointment""... Trying to connect with Amazon but couldn't reach out! At the end of the day I m not happy😔

"
"

  Forgot about camera and performance, rest is just (ok)

"
"

  Charger has become unserviceable within 15 days of buying....i bought it thinking of pormoting make in india ...but this it what i got...please see reviews before buying..dont take chances.

"
"

  Camera is not that much good... Poor speaker quality.. screen is big but video quality is not good... Battary is good

"
"

  Its quite good n worth of the money good screen, battery n size is the best if buget is under 9000 then go for this but bu screen Guard had air bubbles in the middle of the screen  overall good product

"
"

  Value for money 💰 owsome phone and bettry life non stop 1day bettry backup ❣️❣️

"
"

  Finger prints not functioning so the case of face identification too. Now operating through password id only. Rest fine.

"

  Within 8 days charger issue, hang and hot issue and amz denied for replacement.

"
"

  Overall phone is very good the look is also good every feature works except the speakers the speakers are very poor quality. The speakers don't work well. Otherwise it's best for the given price.

"
"

"
"

"
"

  Battery backup superb..camera great for the price...only drawbacks if I need to pick at all are sound quality and bluetooth coverage

"
"

  This product is not good.. camera quality is too bad. Sound quality is not good Waste of money

"
"

  As of now the product is very good .Long life  battery and full screen 7 inch .Far better than a tecno power 2 .

"
"

  It's a good product in less price but sound quality is very baddd.For multimedia another sound is not available in the phone .Only call speaker is there.

"
"

  Really superb mobile with all the mentioned features.  Buyed 2 mobiles which is suitable for children's online classes. Good for video sharing having 7inch display.

"
"

  Best budget Mobile. Good looking, good Battery life, Fingerprint reader works nicely. Camera quality is also OK. Big in size but not problematic. All in all good.

  Everything is great, but only one problem is that this smartphone comes with go edition.So Use go applications like Google go,Files go,Photos go and so on....

"
"

  At this budget this phone is best.There are some lag in this phone

"
"

  Amazon offers was unbelievable & Tecno Mobile also unbelievable but packaging was very simple.

"
"

  Display, battery and camera all are above average.  For the price really worth. Screen size was really mammoth.

"
"

  I feel it is just like realme c3 that i perchased in 7000 RS. But now in this price it is good than realme c3.

"
"

  Really it's very nice excellent camera quality very happy to bought this phone

"
"

  poor perfomance, hang some times, too heavy to carry, too large to handle comfortably. camera quality is not as expected.

  Thank you samsung and Amazon for timely rakshabandhan delivery.Now for readers this is a review unbiased and written after testing and continuous usage :-Pro's1.Screen ppi is great as entry level device✌2.Battery backup is awesome thanks to samsungs R&D even with .7mamp charger.👀3.Android go version 10 is cute without craps4.Reading pdfs is easy and comfort for eyes atleast samsung has guts to say the truth.5.No lag till now because i dont need gaming other than that all regular even without go apps are nicely running.6.fingerprint and face lock i dont need so good they are not provided.7.Call quality is okay.Speaker is normal.8.For music lovers dowload any music app with equilizer will be fine.9.16gb/32gb and sd card is okay.10.Auto smart memory cleaner(use smart manager in settings once a day) for smooth RAM functioning and ROM cleaning🤗11. Supports OTG as well.Cons1. Camera below average still expected but samsung should work more on this front if they wanna beat chinese phones.2.Not for gamers and thats expected buy a 4gb Ram 🤔 based phone why reading me?😉3.finger print and face lock missing I Can manage but most indians can't.4.Battery takes 3.15 hours to charge to work for 12 hours of calling and surfing and thats not bad at all but can be issue for chinese phone lovers who have habit of charging again and again to play pubg.Overall out of 5.Camera-2  Gui-4  Screen ppi-5  speed-4  android-4Don't buy a phone only because of specifications must see integration and longevity overall a nice secondary option and primary for featured phone switchers.

"
"

  Very smooth UI latest M series .Battery is good. 3000mahIt has dark mode.Apps run smoothly.Camera is average.Best for secondary phone.Apps are of GO versionWiFi calling feature.

"
"

  I free of cost taken this phone for I show my friends in WhatsApp & facebook this phone a budget phone and full specification and more sell for samsung smartphones.

"
"

  Its not working. Pls don't buy this phone. Listen carefully, Only on August 14th 2020 I bought this, but today 23.08.2020 its not working. I couldn't even switch this mobile on. Samsung Galaxy M01 mobile. Mobile is not worth. As today I came to amazon for return or replacement this cheater has closed the return window by yesterday. How cunning they are ? not even ten days its been since I have bought. This cheaters have closed it. Its not working now.  Even if I call toll free numbers no one responses.

"
"

  The phone suddenly went completely dead within 10 minutes of switching it on after receiving it. Asked for a return, but the delivery boy didn't take the return because the phone is dead! Again request a return. Waiting to see what happens now. Can not take it to any shop or dealer as it is purchased online.

"
"

  After using 4/5 days suddenly without notice, the phone shutdown automatically and I couldn't restart it. So contact with amazon for replacing it and get very quick response from their end and they book a time slot to verify it by a technician. But after few hours later I found in start up guide send by Samsung,  how to restart when it stops working or hanged( by pressing power and volume key simultaneously for seven seconds or more). The fault is from the end of Samsung company I suppose, because they should mention the process on the front page with bold letter. Most of the reviews which get 1 star facing the same problems like of mine.  After using one month I want to add some extra points which impressed me.1. Sound quality and graphics are very good.2. Smooth touch sensitivity3. Ringtones are much louder.4.Two volte nano SIM s work fine together.5.Battery backup is good. Charging time is not so lengthy.6.Any SIM can be switched off manually, that impressed me.7. 2GB ram and 32 GB storage is better option for budget friendly people.8. I faced hanging problem for one day only till now , which can be easily solved by pressing volume down key and power key simultaneously for 7 seconds or more.8. Lastly this mobile is Made in India which I like the most.  So any one can go for it. Amazon agents are really helpful which I experienced.

"
"

  Thanks Amazon for delivering the product as mentioned in the product description. It was well packed and delivered.By the way, A Special Thanks to SAMSUNG for stepping up to INDIA's needs and introducing a new Line of Phones for taking on the Chinese Incursions in Indian Mobile Phone Market.We ordered ""Samsung Galaxy M01 Core (Blue, 2GB RAM, 32GB Storage)"" and thrown away the chinese phone Salomi as it had 100 other Apps Pre-Installed without our information and heating phone and draining battery. Had a tough times using that 'Salomi' phone. Now with a GOOD / BETTER Phone from GOOD Company Samsung, happy to own this ""Little Cute Phone"".Samsung Galaxy M01 Core (Blue, 2GB RAM, 32GB Storage) -- is a small enough to keep in pockets and has all the Latest Android 10 OS with a Good Display.  -- All latest version of Apps in a lite mode which means what we need only will be loaded and given instead of ""loading all forever"" and wasting our Precious Data.-- A good Camera with Samsung Reliability is known for its Crisp Camera and Displays.What else needed in a phone. Thanks SAMSUNG for bringing a new Affordable Range with Latest Android 10 OS.Way to go SAMSUNG. Surely we INDIANS will support SAMSUNG and make it to No.1 Company by replacing the Chinese Mobile Companies in INDIA.

  Not bad....can suggest this mbl for normal users.... charging speed is very much disappointed , taking lot of time to charge up ....basic charger type not even USB cable....this suits for parents only ....not for youngsters, gamers etc.

"
"

  I am writing this review after the usage of 15 days. It is one of the worst phones Samsung has made with multiple issues. Me and my friend both purchased the same phone for our aunts and are facing the same issues. The main issue I am facing is that the phone switched off 2 days back and since then I am trying to switch it on but its leading me nowhere. Neither it is charging. Phone heats up while charging as well as in normal usage conditions. While charging the phone heats up to an extent that one may feel that it could blast. My friend also faced the phone off issue but it was resolved automatically after 2 days when he connected a fast carger to the phone. He is too facing the heating issue. His phone still switches off on its own again and again now and then... All we both are able to do is to regret on wastage of our money.

"
"

  I have recieved this phone on 14th of August 2020 and today is 24th of August 2020.So After 10 Days i am reviewing this phone because i have seen many negative reviews on amazon review portal so now my true experience is about this phone following.1:- Processor Media tek Quad core Is best because quad core take less power from battry than the octa core processor. and i purchased this phone for my mom so quad core porcessor is sufficient to my mom.2:- Battry life is good because of Quad Core Processor.3:- Ram is 2Gb that is also sufficient4:- Display as always awesome as samsung provide.5:- Mike and Speaker's quality is too good as always samsung provide.6:- Many People said in the review that the mobile is automatically swiched off and on automatically. yes i have seen this my own only one time. but its not the problem. every new phone have done this one time because of system works smoothly. and after one time switch off on things happen then never repeated till my 10 days of use this phone. so you people who is taking switch off on problem very seriously ,you should not. this is one time process when phone is new sometimes phone may swich off and on automatically. so dont panik at all for this.7:- most of the people want to replace the phone because of one time switch off on problem then i have to say one thing that your first phone is the only phone who is brand new and the replaced phone never be a new phone at all . so never replace your new phone. this is my own experience.8:- I am fully satisfied from this phone in this price of 6499.9:-This is all the reason that is why i am giving 5 star this phone.Thank U Samsung.

  I free of cost taken this phone for I show my friends in WhatsApp & facebook this phone a budget phone and full specification and more sell for samsung smartphones.

  Its not working. Pls don't buy this phone. Listen carefully, Only on August 14th 2020 I bought this, but today 23.08.2020 its not working. I couldn't even switch this mobile on. Samsung Galaxy M01 mobile. Mobile is not worth. As today I came to amazon for return or replacement this cheater has closed the return window by yesterday. How cunning they are ? not even ten days its been since I have bought. This cheaters have closed it. Its not working now.  Even if I call toll free numbers no one responses.

"
"

  The phone suddenly went completely dead within 10 minutes of switching it on after receiving it. Asked for a return, but the delivery boy didn't take the return because the phone is dead! Again request a return. Waiting to see what happens now. Can not take it to any shop or dealer as it is purchased online.

"
"

  After using 4/5 days suddenly without notice, the phone shutdown automatically and I couldn't restart it. So contact with amazon for replacing it and get very quick response from their end and they book a time slot to verify it by a technician. But after few hours later I found in start up guide send by Samsung,  how to restart when it stops working or hanged( by pressing power and volume key simultaneously for seven seconds or more). The fault is from the end of Samsung company I suppose, because they should mention the process on the front page with bold letter. Most of the reviews which get 1 star facing the same problems like of mine.  After using one month I want to add some extra points which impressed me.1. Sound quality and graphics are very good.2. Smooth touch sensitivity3. Ringtones are much louder.4.Two volte nano SIM s work fine together.5.Battery backup is good. Charging time is not so lengthy.6.Any SIM can be switched off manually, that impressed me.7. 2GB ram and 32 GB storage is better option for budget friendly people.8. I faced hanging problem for one day only till now , which can be easily solved by pressing volume down key and power key simultaneously for 7 seconds or more.8. Lastly this mobile is Made in India which I like the most.  So any one can go for it. Amazon agents are really helpful which I experienced.

  Thanks Amazon for delivering the product as mentioned in the product description. It was well packed and delivered.By the way, A Special Thanks to SAMSUNG for stepping up to INDIA's needs and introducing a new Line of Phones for taking on the Chinese Incursions in Indian Mobile Phone Market.We ordered ""Samsung Galaxy M01 Core (Blue, 2GB RAM, 32GB Storage)"" and thrown away the chinese phone Salomi as it had 100 other Apps Pre-Installed without our information and heating phone and draining battery. Had a tough times using that 'Salomi' phone. Now with a GOOD / BETTER Phone from GOOD Company Samsung, happy to own this ""Little Cute Phone"".Samsung Galaxy M01 Core (Blue, 2GB RAM, 32GB Storage) -- is a small enough to keep in pockets and has all the Latest Android 10 OS with a Good Display.  -- All latest version of Apps in a lite mode which means what we need only will be loaded and given instead of ""loading all forever"" and wasting our Precious Data.-- A good Camera with Samsung Reliability is known for its Crisp Camera and Displays.What else needed in a phone. Thanks SAMSUNG for bringing a new Affordable Range with Latest Android 10 OS.Way to go SAMSUNG. Surely we INDIANS will support SAMSUNG and make it to No.1 Company by replacing the Chinese Mobile Companies in INDIA.

  Not bad....can suggest this mbl for normal users.... charging speed is very much disappointed , taking lot of time to charge up ....basic charger type not even USB cable....this suits for parents only ....not for youngsters, gamers etc.

  I am writing this review after the usage of 15 days. It is one of the worst phones Samsung has made with multiple issues. Me and my friend both purchased the same phone for our aunts and are facing the same issues. The main issue I am facing is that the phone switched off 2 days back and since then I am trying to switch it on but its leading me nowhere. Neither it is charging. Phone heats up while charging as well as in normal usage conditions. While charging the phone heats up to an extent that one may feel that it could blast. My friend also faced the phone off issue but it was resolved automatically after 2 days when he connected a fast carger to the phone. He is too facing the heating issue. His phone still switches off on its own again and again now and then... All we both are able to do is to regret on wastage of our money.

  I have recieved this phone on 14th of August 2020 and today is 24th of August 2020.So After 10 Days i am reviewing this phone because i have seen many negative reviews on amazon review portal so now my true experience is about this phone following.1:- Processor Media tek Quad core Is best because quad core take less power from battry than the octa core processor. and i purchased this phone for my mom so quad core porcessor is sufficient to my mom.2:- Battry life is good because of Quad Core Processor.3:- Ram is 2Gb that is also sufficient4:- Display as always awesome as samsung provide.5:- Mike and Speaker's quality is too good as always samsung provide.6:- Many People said in the review that the mobile is automatically swiched off and on automatically. yes i have seen this my own only one time. but its not the problem. every new phone have done this one time because of system works smoothly. and after one time switch off on things happen then never repeated till my 10 days of use this phone. so you people who is taking switch off on problem very seriously ,you should not. this is one time process when phone is new sometimes phone may swich off and on automatically. so dont panik at all for this.7:- most of the people want to replace the phone because of one time switch off on problem then i have to say one thing that your first phone is the only phone who is brand new and the replaced phone never be a new phone at all . so never replace your new phone. this is my own experience.8:- I am fully satisfied from this phone in this price of 6499.9:-This is all the reason that is why i am giving 5 star this phone.Thank U Samsung.

  Poor Quality. Phone is not functional after 2 days of use. I bought it as a spare phone and didn't use much or neither downloaded any big apps. Phone is not getting on. It has happened under 7 days of delivery and I made a return on Amazon but it's not showing any confirmation or clarity. Waste of money.

"
"

  Product is good in that budgetAnd performance is excellent

"
"

  The bad part of this mobile was that it lasted only half day. Next morning it did not work even after charging and trying everything possible, but what's WORST IS AMAZON RETURN PROCESS. Highly disappointed with Amazon process it took me approx 4 days and 2 hours of phone calls to get the defective product returned.

"
"

  #Very poor camera.#Battery ok but slow charging.#I got this in exchange for 3.8k ,  So , I am satisfied.# M10 was far far better.#gaming ok#worst part is camera.dont expect any nice  pics.#small screen so easy to handle.#overall 3.9star I'll give,coz you own samsung at such cost.# may be bigger M01 is better.

"
"

  Major issue with this phone is slow charging and quick battery draining. Look of handset is sleek and smart but charer is Normal(Non-USB). To connect with other devices like laptop, PC, you will need to purchase extra USB cable. Backside of phone get heated if using for long time like an hour or more. I was recording video on 14.08.2020 and in 15-20 minutes, phone get overheated and I stopped video recording.

  Update 16 Oct 20Samsung service is trying to push manufacturing defects as my fault. They are playing with small users. Please be careful buying any Samsung product as they are operating like a fly-by-night company.I've already spent Rs. 3,000 for a Rs. 6,000 phone without a working phone for the last 1 month.Update on 29 Sep 20.Reducing status to 1 star.The phone is increasingly giving problems.a) The screen responsiveness is getting worse.b)  The SD card is always giving error.c) Taking lots of time to load Apps.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I exchanged my Samsung On5 for Samsung M01 Core mainly because of the lack of internal memory. Good sturdy experience of On5 let me to buy this phone. I have no complaints about the hardware though many of the software have regressed from On5. Let me write them down:1. Samsung On5 running on Android 6 was more stable than current Android 10. It has rebooted atleast twice on it's own.2. Camera has no panorama and other mode which was there in On5.3. Chrome hanged twice during this period.4. SD card stopped reading once. Had to push it back again to work. Never happened in On5.5. Do Not Disturb can't be customized. Samsung On5 had it.6. Unread SMS not highlighted.Go version shouldn't mean regression. I'll be happy to discuss with the architects who would want genuine op

"
"

  I wud have given no star but unfortunately there's no such option. The mobile stops reading the sim card often on the second day of use. When tried to replace the item quoting defective product, they ask me to install an app to solve the problem and the app itself doesn't work. IT SUCKS. My money got wasted.

"
"

  It has all the basic features and the interface is quite smooth. It has support to wi-fi calling also. Overall the phone is good value for the money spent on it.

"
"

  Samsung is loting money by giving worst product I am using this phone after one month it started and stop working saying overheating if I watch movie for half an hour of video call for half an hour

"
"

  It's really value for money 💰🙂...The phone comes with a 5.30-inch touchscreen display with a resolution of 720x1480 pixels and an aspect ratio of 18.5:9. Samsung Galaxy M01 Core is powered by a 1.5GHz quad-core MediaTek MT6739 processor. It comes with 1GB of RAM. The Samsung Galaxy M01 Core runs Android Go Edition and is powered by a 3000mAh battery.As far as the cameras are concerned, the Samsung Galaxy M01 Core on the rear packs 8-megapixel camera. The rear camera setup has autofocus. It sports a 5-megapixel camera on the front for selfies.

"
"

  Too much lagging as like there is only 250 MB RAM.Disappointed with the slowness of the device (I have already updated the software to latest version).

"
"

  Nice product

"
"

  The battery 🔋 is totally worst and touch is very bad charging is also not proper.

"
"

  Samsung didn't meet my expectations this time. I had been a big fan of Samsung products and this product of theirs disappointed me. Battery gets hot while watching videos, playing games and when connected to the net. Battery drains fast. Not suitable for video calls. Although I bought a 2GB RAM version, video and voice keeps cutting in and out. Tried different networks. No earphones. Cheap looking charger. Samsung should not compromise on quality. If they cannot afford to release a budget phone, they should not. Instead, continue with their mid and high range phones.

"
"

  since day one sim slot is not properly working, some times it is showing ""insert sim"" error. Then again i have to restart the phone or reinsert the sim to connect the phone. I changed the sim card, then also same problem is continuing and it is clear that there is problem in sim slot. hence pl arrange to replace the phone at the earliest.

"
"

   I recieved this  item on 9this August, it was working fine. But just after 9 days, this  phone not  charging.  I  try  with  two  other charger. The  phone also  get  discharged. It is not  going  on. Also  if it is put for  charging,  the  charging icon  not on and  this phone  not  charging.

"
"

  It's a 2GB phone, you can't expect much, even Facebook lags while going through lots of browsing. The camera is Ok. The build is not good, you must use a rubber cover and temper protection. It has a 3000mah battery that's why discharges quickly and doesn't support fast charging which creates more problems. Overall what you can expect at such a cost?Analyze your needs before purchasing it. The phone is decent for household usage with few apps, but if you want to have multiple apps then don't go for it..

"
"

  Gr8 phone at the price of 6,500 from Samsung. As of now everything looks fine.

"
"

  The mobile contains  poor battery quality. 80% of charge has been drained in 3 hours with average use. Do not buy it to waste your money.Amazon will mention to return or replace product within 7 days, at the time of purchase .But in actual they will delay unnecessarily and will pass the time frame , by different protocols, as nobody can return it . Even if it is  a faulty set and there is a chance to return it.

"
"

  Everything is good as per phone price but only one thing I don’t like in this phone that is when u continues use it for 25-30 minutes it start getting heat which is not good

"
"

  This mobile is giving very poor quality of audio with breaking voice in zoom video call. I applied for return policy, but they did not accepting for return. I was shocked due to this kind of behaviour from Amazon. I will put a case through online , if they will not take return.

"
"

  Not a good phone, waste of money

"
"

  First time in life I dared to purchase a phone from Amazon. First time a Samsung phone I bought stopped working went dead within a few hours.  Later Amazon agents kept on visiting but deny to pick up the product saying it is dead.. 4 times. I kept on calling customer care in 6 or 7 calls the phone is not picked up by return agent in 15 days. Money is with Amazon. Which means Amazon is using the money. Not sure how many escalations i have to make replace the productThe product might be good but buying it from Amazon iz a pain.If you are unlucky and phone is dead you will keep begging for return. Your money will be stuck with Amazon.WORST way Amazon India treats the Customer. Better use Amazon not cheap products

"
"

  Good product.Works well and looks stylish. Ideal for thousands of people who use the internet and call features intelligently. It's non-Chinese so adds to patriotism .Very economical and absolutely value for money.Excellent service by Amazon too! Highly recommended!

"
"

  I ignored the negative reviews, especially those about receiving phones that would not turn on.  I paid the price for it.  I received a phone that never turned on- defective.  But, then the worst part was yet to come.  The wait for an inspection.  Then, the worst bit about waiting a few weeks for amazon to pick the package back.  I understand that amazon did its best in these circumstances in the COVID scenario.  I would strongly suggest that this model could be best avoided.  Samsung should seriously consider withdrawing models such as these which are a shame.

"
"

  Touch screen not working from first day of use. I requested for replace the mobile after few days delivery boy says Amazon app should have the Amazon app, the problem is I can't install the app without screen function. Still waiting Amazon to solve the problem

"
"

  Not worth 5000/- at all but perfectly worth 2800/- if ever available at this price point... LoLBasic feature handheld. Nothing much to sport or brag about. Basic functions. Smooth body and surface. Screen brightness that blinds. Crisp camera for a budget phone. All else, simply rubbish! Let your maidservant or kid play around with it instead. Haha!

"
"

  Excellent phone in low budget.Light weight phone .Good phone for old age people

"
"

  Good handset of Samsung under budget , as battery mAh is 3000 gives normal performance depends upon usage and takes time to charge too . As I bought it for my dad and it's good for elders as its comfy for use !!

"
"

  Definitely Samsung is a very good brand and we can blindly do faith on it.Phone is really good.Build quality is very good and battery life is awesome.Camera is just average bcoz we can't expect bery high quality in this price range.Sound quality is also average.Overall it is really a good deal in this price range but if we compare it with MI in this range. The. MI definitely has a lead over it.Redmi 8a dual is best substitute to this phone.

"
"

  I used may types of android mobiles I purchased this mobile for my Mother and also to test how Android GO works.Things I Like in this device:-1. Camera - When I see the feature of 8MP Primary Camera, I thought that cameras may be average in this device.  But, in real the camera clarity was awesome at the price I real didn't expect this Samsung surprised  me. Even the Front 5MP camera also chapters clear pictures.  Rear Camera has dedicated flash and surprisingly Front Camera has Screen Flash(Good See this).***Camera samples - Cell Tower, Charger and Spectacles were captured with Samsung M01 Core. Other Pictures were captured by Some other devices.2. Display - Many companies who were selling the devices at 10k even above range are still providing HD+ (720P)  screen. But, I really felt happy that we are getting excellent display with good viewing angles at 5-6k.  But, we need to note that it is TFT display, not IPS display.3. Design - Samsung is providing mate texture finish at the back, Ofcourse it is made of cheap plastic it will  definitely protect the devices from scratches.4. Operating System - This device comes with Android GO which is the lite version of Android. But, it comes with  latest  Android 10 out of the box. And Android will provided updates regularly. I bought  2GB RAM variant and installed may apps(Not much larger apps, but some general purpose  apps) I didn't find any lagging issues while using them.5. Battery - This Device comes with 3000mah battery, but I noticed that Samsung mentioned that this was  typically, which means 3000mah was not the exact rating. But, still it's ok to have that capacity in this  device. As Android GO is the lighter version it almost consumes very less battery. You watch 4-5 hours  of YouTube videos with single charge. So definitely it is more at the price.Think I didn't like:-1. Very low charger rating - Out of the box it comes with 5V - 0.7A charger (3.5W) which is very slow to charger  3000mah battery. It takes 3+ hours to full charger the device. I have 10W fast charger  with me I tried to charger with that, I was charging up but still taking 3+ hours to  charge it. So, it won't accept fast charge. As a costumer we expect at least 10W  charger at the price.2. No Face Unlock - Face Unlock feature is very common in every device now. But, this feature was missing. They  are providing PIN, PATTERN and PASSWORD options to secure your device.3. Price - Actually, this is my bad luck. when I placed the order the price of the product is 6,499/- and I paid the  full amount online. It takes 2days to reach it to me, when I received the order the product price went  down to 5,999/-.

  the best thing is it is android 10.then 1 gb ram ok but  if 2gb ram then very goodstorage is very goodcamera okdisplay size if it would5.5 inch so very good but its 5.3it is not ips lcd display it is hd+ tft displaybattery also ok for normal usageeverything is good in its price

  True Reviews,Worst phone in the world. Don’t see the YouTube reviews and buy this phone they are just lying. I wanted to give it less than one star but there was no option. I looks good in photos but is very very small phone. It lags and sticks a lot even in 2GB ram. A never buy product. Camera is freakin’ waste. They say it has 12MP camera but actually is like 2MP. The apps keep exiting themselves.And says app not responding. The WORST PHONE. Don’t buy this is my honest review. I bought it today and returned the phone on the same day it self within hours . If you wanna waste your money then invest in this phone . The packing and everything is rather soo good but phone does not function good at all.Thank You.

"
"

  Video playback as well as camera is not smooth even though it's meant to run HD videos.Tried to return the product but Amazon initiated replacement procedure by saying that particular piece is faulty, however new piece is also having same issues and I can't see replace/ return option anymore.In conclusion, the hardware is not compatible with specification. Don't go for this product and bad service from Amazon.

"
"

  So, I had purchased this set on 8/sep with much excitement but i had never expected that i have to face soo much drama for replacement / refund.phone started heating after every 2minutes use, when you visit om replacement option,  where thr actually no any replacement option , thr is option to download the app or talk to techincan , you have to explain your problem twice- thrice to them...thn they will ask you to download the app..then they will check temperature then they will arrange a techincan visit at your place , after so much of struggle. Then you will will get replacement then again same problem (may persist or maynot be)  In my case i am not satisfied with product i thought it is of Samsung brand so i cn go for it but now there is no any exchange police😔😔 but (Kamchalu type model)!!  you can invest 2k more and can go for a good model...2star...ps- such a long review but it is truthhhhhhh, now i will think twice before purchasing from amazon!!

"
"

  Product is fine but has limitations to function only in india. And it doesn't work well for my Mom cause she keeps travelling abroad frequently.Why wasn't I informed by Amazon about the restrictions that the phone can't function in other countries? There are other countries in the world too where they've been using mobile phones even before India.Misleading the customers shouldn't be the priority of Amazon

"
"

  Amazon upi, amazon scan & Pay, amazon  money  load not working on this phone  it gets version  not updated  error in play sore it shows open it called to amazon  & Samsung  customer  care but amazon says phone version  does not support  its run on anderoid lite go version so may have problem  in lite version samsung  told to visit  their service  center so dont know it will work on anderoid  10 lite go version ?

"

  I've been using this as my Official mobile... Apps like WhatsApp, fb lite, cricbuzz, playmusic, YouTube, Microsoft Teams, Outlook, Intelligent Hub, Hrms, Bankings apps like YONO, Paytm, gpayWith these apps it's running smoothly...A bit of lag, but for this proce range acceptable..Pros:Decent Camera at this proce rangeAverage specs at this price rangeSamsung Brand ValueAndroid Go OSSamsung skin over this OS was decentCons:Below average battery life, anyhow it lasts for a dayPathetic charging speed (more than 4hrs)Charger provided with box is 5V 1A at least 10W charger they could have added

  The mobile Samsung Galaxy M01 Core (Black, 1GB RAM, 16GB , received could not be charged, after battery was low.  Now new phone battery uncharged what do I do, Amazon delivered defective product. This is worst phone

"
"

  Loved this peice best phone at this price. Samsung always worth every penny. Needed phone for onliy class of my son and this is best.

"
"

  I bought this for my mother as her 1st android mobile and she is very happy with it. User friendly and good for 1st time users.

"
"

  It is not at all satisfying because it is not getting charged by any other android charger other than the given one and the process is soo slow.I literally expected something but the result was different soo please dont buy this product at all.It will never match your expectations. The normal android phone is better than this.But i am happy for few things the battery does not drain too fast and the volume is good,but we cant play animated games like pubg or free fire because it strucks in between.At last I am not satisfies with the product even the design is ordinary very normal one but It is better than in images😂 and the camera is not like they have shown. same problem if we move the phone it gets strucked.The quality of camera is not at all good but it is okay for old people and for normal users like who use it only for phone calls and messages

"
"

  Product  is best and  cheapest. I am using  this  mobile  phone,  phone  performance is very  good in this  price . Camera quality is  also  good. So totally mobile  phone is very cheapest.

"
"

  It's been only 9 day since i got the phone and it's already showing problem the phone is not charging and it's dead. The image quality is not matching what you r showing in tha detail. The display is also not good. Anywez i can bare that but the main problem is the phone is not taking charge. And it's dead

"
"

  Honestly I don't like the product. The screen response is very slow ,I can't even pick up the phone quickly. Battery life is very less and requires almost 3hrs for full charge. Overall it is very disappointing.  Only good thing is it supports android 10 that also does not have some features less. This was not expected from samsung, though it is a budget phone.

"
"

  Worst product never ever try to take this product... All of sudden stopped charging and not working after 12 days.... Need to replace this but no source to do... Please don't buy this kind of worst products when ppl are unable to spend much money... Try to take good reviews mobiles

"
"

   Purchased on 26 sep 20, This is second occassion my phone auto switched off and screen is dead. Previously it was so for 3 days, on fourth day it returned to life when tried swich repeatedly. To day the screen gone dead despite of good charge in the battery. Pl look into the matter as complaint window does not work in my panasonic eluga x.Pl help.

"
"

  Don't buy this mobile, it's totally waste.. Camera quality is too bad and battery backup also very slow it takes more than 3 hours to charge fully.. And battery was drained point by point suddenly in the normal usage also.. And heating issue also in this mobile.. Better go with any other brands in this budget..*Return procedure to get refund*In Amazon they say it's a electronic product we can't provide you a refund only we can able to provide you replacement only.. Just accept that they'll send one mobile service field agent to check whether the product is defective or not.. After they approved, they replace the old one and provide you a new one in that same product..In that replacement product also surely you'll face some defects so just ask for an refund directly through the options showing in that order page.. They immediately approve that and within few working days they'll provide you a refund..These kind of electronic product's first time they'll provide replacement offer and second time they'll provide direct refund..

"
"

  I foud it lightweight, good in appereance,Sound quality is very good, battery backup is too good , audio recording feature not found(exists or not) and phone getting heatup during youtube live streaming(may be may bedue to weak signal)Overall it is quality handset

"
"

  Note : for those whose mobile got switched off , press power and volume button at same time . It will be on in safe mode. Then you may restart or can work as it is . ...I purchased for my mother. Because it is small and lightweighted i thought it is perfect for my mom. Previously she had Redmi 7A but because i dont want to have any chinese phone in my home , i decided to exchange with this.Pros : So cute , so small , light weighted , less price , good speed ....cons: Battery , Battery , Battery... My 3 year old J7 2016 (3300Mah )(large screen than this) gave 1 and half day backup and this phone not give backup of single day . MY mother just use 3 to 4 hr daily . Then also My Mom got frustated . She even asked me to give her old phone back. Amazon was not returning this. I gave threat to go to consumer forum and after 2nd visit of technician they understood my problem and gave my money. I really go to consumer court if Amazon wouldnt have accepted my return . Its not about amount but the pain of feeling cheated daily which cause anger. After that i ordered for M21 and contrary to my expectation my mom was happy with large screen . M21 is Awesome . The Best thing about samsung phone is their UI . I love it . So if u r budget conscious then may consider other option but dont go for samsung in less than 10k phone. But I feel that samsung will improve its battery . But i request everyone to not buy chinese product.

"
"

  Bought this product for my aunt. She hardly use any of the app. only for phone calls  sometimes watz app video. Battery back up is not even coming half a day and charge time taking 2:30 hrs with the original charger given by samsung.  I bought this product just want to avoid ReadMI products. But not i am regretting that i purchased this mobile. Samsung needs to atlease match redmi phone quality which are available in this price range

"
"

  Mobile heated up after few mins of usage. Touch is not highly responsive. Mobile vibrates while playing audio in speaker at near full sound. Hangs few times. Display & call quality is good. Poor build quality. Product failed to meet satisfaction.

  I bought two phones M01 core , One is working fine(Shipped from Noida) for two weeks , need to see how long it goes, for the second one (Shipped from WB ) it gets switched off automatically , 1st time when it has 35% battery , need to wait until its battery drains completely, then it got charged and after two days switched off again at 75% charging, Requested for return.I see same complaint by many users .

  Phone was running fine for the first few days. Then suddenly out of the blue it got switched off and gives no response what so ever. I have applied for a return. Thus, not recommended at all.P.S. will post an update on the return after the process is completed.Edit: after filing return a technician was appointed, who cancelled for no reason. Again it was rescheduled who visited and told that a lot of customers are complaining the same and yet the product is available. Anyway he diagnosed the problem as a manufactur detect. I got a replacement instead of a refund. The new phone arrived and came with the same problems. I agian filed for a return and this time got a refund. But I suppose I was lucky as I would have to run to the manufacturer of the problem would have occurred out of return window. A huge no for samsung products!

  My maid brought this for her daughter so she can use it for her online education. It won’t charge and stopped working after a month of use. Also it gets overheated. I saw positive reviews when I bought it.  Anyway it has warranty so will have to go to Samsung service Center and see.

"
"

  Got this for my dad, and writing a review after a months use. Great display and no bloatware. Go for the 32gb variant, value for money !

  Phone is very slow, It gets switched off suddenly. Made complaint to Amazon over the phone . I asked for return . They didn’t agree. Brand new phone with such issue. This is not for I paid this much amount . Please don’t buy . It is waste of money . I downloaded only one app, which is YouTube. I bought it because this is Samsung. I didn’t know Samsung make such bad quality product.

"
"

  Don't buy it from Amazon. They don't help customer and they deliver defective product. I am not able to charge the mobile, they infrom me to consult brand center for repair, as your return window had been closed. Initially I hadn't use the product for a week as I had to gift the product to someone else. So if u think to buy this buy it from samsung store, don't buy it from Amazon.

"
"

  I have received this on 16august 2020....now it's only 6th sep....my phone has become dead and is not charging up.....wasting of money....amazon should help us as this is a defective product and many people are facing same issues....

"
"

  This review is solely for the seller who sold a faulty phone with a huge black spot on the screen. It is so obvious that proper quality check was not done before delivery. This can happen only in case of a used phond being sold as new. Will have to think twice before ordering costly things online, especially in Amazon because as the eshop, Amazon also cannot deny responsibility for this. The headache that I am going through now to return the faulty item is a complete nightmare.

"
"

  Bought this mobile for kids study purpose. They just downloaded the whatsapp and google classroom. And after keeping it on charge for half an hour mobile is not starting at all. Not expect this kind of quality from Samsung.

"
"

  Waste product and process of Amazon. I bought it for a purpose n i found out after the product delivery that it doesnt meet my requirement now I'm dont have an option to return n buy a diff model also. Such a disappointing experience. Awful

"
"

  After 5 Days of usagePros1. 2 Days battery life2. Smooth performance3. Android go edition runs smooth4. Purchased 1 gb ram varient but runs very smooth no legs.Cons1. Charging time is of 3 hrs2. If u installed so many apps it will start legging (i have installed only whatsapp)I have gifted.this phone to my mother she is very happy with the performance.In this price segment this phone is superb.

"
"

  Hey guys ,don't purchase this moblie at all.it is not worthy to use, simply waste of your money.I purchased this phn for my mother.It claims to give 1 yr warranty , but the phn is dead within 1 1/2 months,Very awful product.I chatted with customer service abt whether this item can be replaced or not as it comes within warranty period ,but there is no coperative response as they keep on recycling u on same page.They don't even bother to call even after filing complaint.Simply waste product  , meant to throw in trash...I highly suggest don't buy ...

"
"

  M01 core is very light and handy...value for money...a little bit heat is there...but in this cost ..it is awesome...

"
"

  Mobile is a basic model smartphone .It wil be only suitable for calls , whatap ,youtube and some other basic apps....Phone got over heated and dead by using continuos youtube and games since it's have 1gb ram..After visiting service center phone came live again...If u r a basic user as old age people it is best one or else go for 2gb ram version

"
"

  I am very unsatisfied from this seller and Amazon.. I received a defective product.. It did not switch on. I made a replacement request. And the delivery agent insisted on checking the IMEI number from the phone. I reported the issue to Amazon but every time the agent arrived I would face the same issue. I am one of the loyal customers of Amazon and I did not expect such a behaviour from them. I hope this time it gets replaced.

"
"

  Samsung mobile ok processors is OLD in 2017 processorThse phone is old and use to very slow battery life and heating some timesDont by thsephone

"
"

  Unlike other Samsung handsets that I’ve been using for years, this phone is of a really poor quality. It heated up, the charger heated up too, and then the phone switched off and wouldn’t start. All within hours of opening the new handset. But Amazon has been wonderful with their delivery, repair and return service, so thankfully my refund has been initiated. I will not recommend this model to anyone.

"
"

  Its not the value for money. No C-type charger so charging is very very slow it takes 4-5hrs for 100% battery. Just putting 1000 bucks extra I should get Redmi which is better in this segment.

"
"

  I had purchased  this phone when there was big movement  against  chaines products.  I am facing several issues :1. Battery life not good2. Handset gets heated on nominal uses3. now after months uses phone gets switched off on few minutes talk.conclusion : don't waste your hard earned money in these political or corporate propoganda  like ban against chaines  product

"
"

  Superb for secondary usageBasic smartphone

"
"

  Battery backup, screen quality and camera quality is too poor. Didn't want to buy Chinese, so bought this expecting a good phone. But turned out to be so outdated quality that I felt like I'm living in 2015. Phones released during 2015 had better camera than this phone. Disappointing product from  Samsung when their competitors are offering much better quality phone at same or lower price.

"
"

  The phone stopped working after 15 days and when we took to Samsung repair they charged us money to get it fixed even though under warranty

"
"

  The phone doesn't switch On at all after the initial charging was done. Trying to get a replacement and guidelines by Amazon is not helpful at all. When the phone doesn't work, there is no way we can download an app. On chat with Amazon technician, they said only replacement is possible and that it will be done by 3rd October. .I had approached by 29th September and was told only replacement is possible and that it will be replaced on 3rd October which I am yet to receive. Should I next take this to consumer court??

"
"

  My younger sis using this phone since days and found it isnt a bad deal at all at this cost. Display ,touch response is great baterry life is just ok as prr her use and camera quality is better. My sis is happy to have made in india phone. Must buy phone at this price point. Cheerzz

"
"

  The phone get a switched off within a day of purchase and dont work ever after. I went for the brand name. But I feel I should have gone for MI phone instead of this. This was a gift for my mother.  Such a disappointment and embarrassment. Now Amazon is not very helpful in returning. They need picture of the phone. I think they assumed people has spare phones lying around to take photo for their defective product. Amazon please act as per your brand name at least.

"
"

  Bought this phone for my father (who used to be a feature phone user till now).. A great phone for feature-to-android phone switchers! A value for money phone. It completely satisfy all the basic requirements of a smartphone! GO FOR IT!

"
"

  Device received yesterday afternoon and it was charged to 95’%. Yesterday night it got switched off automatically and not working. Reported this to Amazon customer technical service. They have stated that no stock is available to give replacement immediately and to wait for 48 hrs. Bad experience!!!

"
"

  I buy this for my father basic use. It's nice product, you can't except more in this price. Very light weight, looks good, only I feel according to 2GB RAM it's bit slow. Rest all good. Just last I want to tell there is no Fingerprint lock, face lock, no type C charging, no fast charging. Take 4 hours to complete full charging from 10% to 100%.

"
"

  Don't buy this phone...this is the worst phone i have ever used. I have faced a issue of not charging ( Mobile got switched off and not charging ) after 3 working days. i asked to  amazon customer care  for refund....but there is no refund for this product they replaced the mobile. While using the new phone exactly after 3 days again the same problem began. Even after having the 80% of charging mobile got switched off and not started and not showing any type of indication while charging.

"
"

  For senior citizens this smart phone is sufficient, who don't want unnecessary apps, games etc.With minimal apps for banking and WhatsApp and some more apps this Samsung mobile is more than enough.

"
"

  nothing to dislike  good phone

"
"

  Very nice product..... I, m very happy samsungm01core. Many beautiful products at low prices. The set is very beautiful and quick.  Personally, I like it very much.❤️😍💐👌🎵

"
"

  If you are looking for a smartphone nearby 5000 Rs than this is the One, The samsung Galaxy M01 core. All the features are more than the value of smartphone itself. With 3000 mah battery you can go all day without any extra charge needed. Camera quality also awesome within this range.  Also the design of phone is stunning. Cant even imagin such a low budget smartphone with all this beautiful features. Definitely Samsung alway makes its customers happy. All samsung products are No.1

"
"

  I bought it for my Mom.Pros:- Good Hardware can withstand for years and also looking good- Pretty good camera for the price Rs.5500.- Good loudspeaker.Cons :- Charging dead slow really dead slow.- Lots of bloatware apps , i recommended you to uninstall the bloatware apps the moment you switched on the handset and if not then atleast disable the apps.- Heats a lot even for minimum usage .

"
"

  Its a good product within its price range  battery life is good can standby for 4days with minimalistic usage camera is not that clear but it serves its purpose. Though it consists of 1gb ram it never hanged for me(i never did gaming on it). Overall its a good product at 5.5k range

"
"

  After ysing it for 2 weeksPros:Camera quality is good for this price range.Screen quality is also good.4G Download & Upload speed is fine.Battery back is ok.Cons:It is Android Go version.The mobile heats up quickly after 5 mins of video chat in whats app in a good network area.The system is slow inspite of having 2 Gb Ram in Androis Go version.

"
"

  This smartphone from Samsung is really good for doin' basic task for every day use, and that's the important thing for which I bought this, it was just for RS.5999. For those who want a device just for doing simple basic task can have this. But the only disappointment for me with the device is, they could have optimized the UI just a lil' bit and the battery life is not that good, also for those who dont know this device is powered by Android 10 GO edition.

"
"

  Worst mobile ever, worst service by amazon, no return no replacement, mobile is over heated while using time, and talking time, bt amazon was not ready to replacement, they told me above 40 degree heated then only replaced, very disappointed, I promptly told u after 6 days using it's not a mobile it's a iron box dont go this,I was replaced it, bt sadly second mobile also lot of heated while calling time, n using time, worst experience wd Amazon n Samsung

"
"

  I bought it for my father.The battery life sucks.Requires 2.5 to 3 hrs to charge and a very little time to discharge,Delivered on 29 Oct 2020I tried to return the product after 2 days use , in the return option it was written eligible through 6 Oct .Then I opened the app and there was no return option available.Then I called the customer care , they said they can't do anything...The customer service is too bad ,

"
"

  If you want a good performance never buy this phone...This is not for a college going student...this phone has 3000 mah battery but it feels like it has 1900 mah battery...it takes almost 5 hours to full charge from 0 to 100% ...this mobile is best for elders like dad and mom who has basic knowledge about smartphone...i never suggest you to buy this phone...

"
"

  power button is not working, i ordered this to gift someone, poor response from amazon, tried to apply return request, unable to proceed... poor response from amazon, when i opened the box, phone was in android recovery mode due to power button issue... very much disappointed...

"
"

  Excelent phone for my father in law. I have bought this phone for my father in law as he needs phone which should be small and handy and very lightweight in hand and Major issue with this phone is slow charging and quick battery draining. and one more thing I don’t like in this phone that is when u continues use it for 25-30 minutes it start getting heat which is not good.

"
"

  An perfect phone for someone with moderate budjet and basic needs on a phone.A quality product from Samsung.Display and camera quality are good for the price range.

"
"

  Advantages of this mobile1. No blot applications2. Battery life 37 hours but battery saver mode enhanced up to 125 hours.3. We can transfer installed applications to SD cards4. We can install Candy crush type gameWe can't expect best photo from Rs. 5500-6500 range mobile camera

"
"

  It's a very nice phone in this price only the problem is of the battery it charges slowly.

"
"

  After one month of usage I cannot found any big problem. But I cannot assure anybody that it will last long eventhough I hope it will. One small disadvantage which I found was that, if you use mobile data the battery will drain somewhat quickly. Overall it is a good budget phone.

"
"

  No product support and replacement window is working. I purchased M31 and M01 phone in same week but both were defective. Not recommended Samsung to buy at all.15th September, I received this phone in packed condition an on 23rd sep, I am unable to switch on the set. I have gifted this set to my grand father. Till 22nd night, phone was working fine and on 23rd morning  I am unable to switch on.

"
"

  Unbelievably pathetic product as I ordered one and the phone kept hanging and the charging was not happening so i requested for a change of the phone and today i got a new phone delivered and the same problem is still there as its been more than one hour of charging the phone and the phone is charged by only 15 percent , i will not recommend this product even if this is a real or fake product from samaung I don’t know

"
"

  Very much dissatisfied with product.And moreover if you have still thousands of problems, Amazon will give thousands reasons to prove that they will not refund the money. They will replace everytime and you will end up getting the same product again and again.And Samsung making such products is really disheartening.From a lover of Samsung brand.

"
"

  Value for money is not up to the mark as if you pay just ₹1900 more, you can get way more features like better performance, camera, screen quality & size, battery life with the M01.But for a beginner who uses only Facebook , Whatsapp, YouTube... this would be the one.Sound is good for the price! Camera is the worst but gets the job done.

"
"

  I love it, low price. Only issue is it takes time to charge but its good for whole day with full charge.

"
"

  Worst model. Mobile dead after using for 25 minutes after full 1 charge cycle. Please don't buy this mobile, go for m01 but not this one. But, I got full refund from amazon. Good service from amazon customer care.

"
"

  I bought this phone for my wife and she finds it very compact and convenient to use. The battery has long life so frequent charging is not require. Camera quality is good for normal photography. Screen quality is really very good. You can enjoy watching  videos with amazing quality. Really value for money.

"
"

  The keyboard is very small. It has Samsung keyboard as well as Google keyboard both are too small. Even after increasing the size didn't help. Need to install third party app. The UI is the worst thing with this phone. The icon size is too small for our naked eyes to see clearly. Often i end up clicking another app while i suppose to click another. Also there is no option to increase the size

"
"

  Waste of money and timeLow qualityNo return option availableBad experience from Amazon. No proper response and return policy

"
"

  since beginning it is giving problem. In between the call message is prompted "" NO SIM"" and get disconnected. Been calling samsung but no solution to the problem. Will not recommend it to anyone.

"
"

  Amazing and affordable

"
"

  Unluckily the Samsung Galaxy M01 started overheating and went off after 5 or 6 days of working fine. But Amazon provided a Technician support and again it worked fine for next 3 days. Then episode of switching off happened again and Amazon promised another Technician support.Looking for a better closure of the issue. Will share the feedback here post completion.

"
"

  Best for daily use and not so heavy work...Quad core with 2GB ram is fine...*Not a heavy gaming device!Camera n screen resolution are best for this handset!Applications are optimized and some are of lite version... which is why device don't lag...Samsung is brand name for genuineness!Amazon deals are fabulous...!

"
"

  This phone has so many issue since the first day I bought this.It keeps getting switched off on its own and their is no support from amazon technicians as they give false output and closed the case multiple times. Totally disappointed with this product and was hoping for some better services from Samsung and amazon but seems I have to keep going to their center for its repair.

"
"

  I purchased the phone for my father. This is a budget friendly phone for sure. In my case the usage is minimum as my father is using the same. By this time I didn't find any big cons for the phone. The battery life is decent and the camera is ok. As per my experience this is a best phone for elders in the family and also to people who has a minimal usage of a smart phone.

"
"

  Quite impressive look good finishing or light weight allover goid quality with new features .

"
"

  Bought today, Phone has many issues :Performance is very slow, hanging issues, heating is another one.The screen size very small, the display is not good. Sound and cameras are the worst part of this phone.Is there anything else left on any phone? Yes, battery. I don't know about battery backup but I am sure. It will not be great.

"
"

  Very bad product. Please don't buy. Heating problem is normal. Charger also have heating problem. Wast of money.  Purchased for my mother and now wasting my time and money on this. Pethetic

"
"

  Good phone for beginners. I bought it as gift for my grandmother and she's starting to learn the android phone with this one. Nice average built phone for below moderate users.

"
"

  Waste of hard earned money. Poor service by AmazonTotally useless mobile . Poor battery performance and hangs a lot . When I called to customer care to return it they were asking to install app the phone was not even working to install it and they denied the return lost my money on totally crap product

"
"

  Phone getting Heated in all time ... batter life was worst thing ... what the specification given by amazon is not there ... i am not at all satisfied ... No Refund also available ... WASTE OF MONEY

"
"

  Battery life is less, camera clearty is normal and portait mode is absent, call hearing is not audible we have to open speaker, do not support high quality  videos, old model and less screen for usage and processor is very less and slow

"
"

  I liked it because i needed small anroid phone for calls only and net

"
"

  BATTERY LIFE GOODCAMERA QUALITY OKAY FOR SELFIESOVERALL ITS A NICE BUYBUT ITS NOT MEANT FOR APP HOARDERS OR PUBG PLAYING AS IT HEATS UP THE PHONE.FOR AVERAGE USE SUCH AS ONLINE CLASS MEETING STUDIES AND LIGHT APPS AND GAMES ITS AMONG THE BEST PURCHASES AND THIS REVIEW IS AFTER 8 DAYS OF PURCHASE OF PRODUCTIF ANY ISSUE I WILL UPDATE.

"
"

  After 1month of usage:Battery suddenly drops from 100% to 40%, heating issue while in call. I will Not recommend this phone. Just Go for midrange mobiles above 8000rs.

"
"

  Product is very bad because it has very short battery backup. Charging time is very  long. It takes longer than usual. Camera quality is very poor. Amazon service is very bad after complaint about product they didn't solve problem.

"
"

  I use this phone as basic. But this phone hang at every touch.Camera quality is clear.Value of money is also cheap.Battery don't last for full day. Without use last for 10 hrs. Using Internet last for 4hrs only.

"
"

  I am getting over heat from this mobile. Want to return but no return option was there . I have raise a complaint to technician he has give some procedure to reset . After doing the reset also experienced the same heat issue .

"
"

  After using 2 days, phone was suddenly  gone off Inspite of half battery percentage..Went to samusung  service they made it on  later again using 2 days it was again gone sudden off,First time bad experience from SAMSUNG products..Don't go for this Miseries cheap phone..It needed to be replaced as defect device manufactured.

"
"

  Bought this phone 2 weeks back. But facing a lot of problems. I was talking on the phone with 60% charge and suddenly the phone went blank and we couldn't switch it on for 2 days.Yesterday I was on call and after talking I couldn't cut the call. After trying a lot I switched it off and on againDisappointed

"
"

  The return period is over yesterday, where to contact. Then I contacted the Samsung customer care. They told to went for service center. The problem is software update. Without software update my phone not turned on. After the service person updated the software the phone got ON ed. This one is new for me, without update the phone not switch on.

"
"

  I have received the phone but didn’t work after 5 th day, didn’t start up. I believe Samsung is very good brand it should not go useless in few days. Tried to return but it’s hard process through amazon.in especially when you are out of country and ordering for parents or relatives through India account. I will not recommend anyone to buy this.

"
"

  Not sure why Phone is over heating from the first use itself. Earlier I have used 1GB ram phones. However, I feel this phone is little slow. Camera and screen quality is Good. Only issue is heating and slow.

"
"

  Yesterday  i received  my phone  by Amazon  i just stated used it today  while using  internat phone  getting  hotter... i called  Amazon  care they said download  blancoo app and can find temperature ..i fear mobile  can blast with in 7 days i will return it if problems  continue..thanks

"
"

  This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand manufactured in India.Long lasting battery life (3000mAh)Phone has 8 megapixel rear camera and has a 5 megapixel camera for selfieHandy phone with a Display size 5.3Overall worth for the money, without second taught you can go for this phone.

"
"

  This mobile is perfect for low budget buyers and also there are many interesting features which everyone absolutely like it. This mobile is price worthy.I am using this device for 2 weeks and it's running very smoothly but remember it's not for high quality games. Over all it's best mobile under Rs.10000

"
"

  Phone look is classy, battery backup a-one. camera front and back is average. there is big problem in hand set that is heating problem  while using without wifi or with wifi. that is big weakness of this phone.

"
"

  I purchased this phone but I didn't like,I talked to customer care for return but there is no any option for return,First time I got major drawback of Amazon if purchased mobile any how you have to use it either you like or not, Dump for me,Just I waste 6399 rupeese.Thanks for fast delivery...

"
"

  WORST QUALITY.WAS DEAD IN TWO WEEKS.I SUGGEST YOU SEARCH FOR BETTER CHEAPER CHINESE PRODUCTS THAN THIS SAMSUNG ENTRY LEVEL GARBAGE.

"
"

  Today I purchased Samsung M01 core easy hand comfortable ,slim nice lookBut  toch screen quality not satisfied left side top touch not working  properlyDear Samsung you please maintain your reputaion in your mobile platform because of big aduience with your side,dont lose your  single supporters from your side

"
"

  Compromises a lot on Battery, you can literally see each percentage gradually failing towards Zero! Overall a Good Package for someone looking for Basic Experience. Cameras are Good. Screen looks fabulous for the price point! Android Go version don't let you do a lot of things, and I mean it.

"
"

  Very fast  delivery from Amazon, Its Good looking phone for normal user and low price, Normal camera result and battery backup is not so good, Only one day for normal use. Overall good for routine use everyday, Don't expect much in this price. Thank you Samsung, Thank you Amazon.

"
"

  Just wow.....and I gifted to my mom ...she just loved it 😊tqq samsung❤️..not for education purpose just used to see YouTube videos and video calls for elder ones..battery life is good but camera quality is not bad but for my mom camera is not all useful ..she just watch news in phone.finally she loved it..u can buy to ur parents😊

"
"

  Bought this product on 16-09-2020 , after using 17 days the phone is not working, not start. return window has been closed. many times trying contact to customer  service. Got a single reply return and exchange window has been closed.please don't buy.

"
"

  It's brilliant. 100% value for money. Great battery life, awesome camera quality, and vibrant screen colours as seen in the image. The back panel is so beautiful and different than every other phone that you would feel bad to cover it up!Strong and sturdy as well, the M01 Core does it's job at the price it's tagged in.

"
"

  Poor quality no return performance is too bad

"
"

  It's horrible. Got switched off on its own just 4 days. Shocked after buying from Amazon. Horrible seller product. Have asked for a tech visit. Amazon it's our hard earned Mone kindly refund.

"
"

  waste product, not getting/picking battery charge... thinking to throw on sellers head for providing such bad quality handset

"
"

  Right choice for only general users.. battery life is perfect as this segment.. camera quality as this range is being best..

"
"

  Manufacturing defectNeed to replace

"
"

  Pathetic Heating issue SAMSUNG will become Next NOKIA I buyed SAMSUNG M01 Also same Heating Issue With Love with Amazon

"
"

  It has a bit heating issues but over all at this price it is a good dealBest for elderly people or people with less usage of cell phone

"
"

  Low cost less featureValue of price is satisfiedPhone recommend for people who want upgrade to smart phone from keypad phone with very less use-ageSound quality is lowTouch screen sense is okFrom internal gb for storage is occupied by pre-installed app 50% apps are useful from pre-installed

"
"

  This phone is not good. It is getting hot very quickly. Even after talking 10 minutes it will become very hot and the battery life is also not good. The phone will be switched off automatically after gei hot. Overall I am not satisfied with this. Total waste of money. So please don't buy this phone anyone.

"
"

  The delivered phone was not functioning Properly, frequently get switched off planning for replacement.The replaced one is in good condition and working good.Suitable for elders those who need a simple phone for calling and social medias.

"
"

  Within one day of use the phone randomly switched off. I tried to charge it and pressed the pwer key but there was no response. After a few tries i figured it out. This phone switches off randomly and can only be switched on by pressing volume key and power key simultaneously.

"
"

  I give zero start to this phone and also to amazon for not replacing this. Very disappointing, waste of money. Now I decided to didn't shop anymore from Amazon ..

"
"

  Totally waste of money..I purchased Samsung M01 core Mobile on 17 August 2020, today ( 17/9/2020) mobile is dead. mobile switched off automatically.Mobile is not working any other functions like format and Boot..So don't buy this product please. my money is wasted..😢

"
"

  I have gifted this Phone to Mr.Imran Ali Shamsi at Rampur -UP.He has received. He told me that it held up too much.Please advise someine to Contact Him on Tel- No-92590 64396  and resolve the matter.If Phone is defective, please arrange replacement.

"
"

  Worst product ever got. Mobile is not turning on now. I can’t able to return.

"
"

  Please do not buy this phone as its battery or some software is faulty right from the beginning. After not even a week's use a message comes up saying that the battery is overheating and then the phone gets switched off.

"
"

  Camera quality is nice in this budget and Battery life is good for normal user I don't recommend it to heavy users because Processor is normal and good in this price .Screen quality is TFT LCD which is nice ,Overall this is the best smartphone in this budget.

"
"

  Good phone in this price range.And it isn't made in China,so extra points for that.Like other reviewers have mentioned,this phone shuts down, in the first day,just force reboot it and it won't give any problems afterwards.

"
"

  In product description handset is available with phone is written but it is not there in product.Wrong Information is being provided by Amazon.

"
"

  Product is good but some software are not working as zoom app.... Cell has over heating issues while talking or watching videos or charging... Suggest not to get this mob if u ve another option

"
"

  Very poor battery phone is heating while using it for 5minutes poor performance poor quality Product please don't buy it waste of money and time

"
"

  Value for money can't say much but according to brand it can be a OKAY deal. Small size and dum processing speed. You can get better device at this price of any other brand. Samsung can do better

"
"

   Amazing mobile phone from the Samsung company which is available in very low price designed with features which can be easily accessed by anyone (older adults) this product is best for our parents. Thank you samsung for such a great product

"
"

  The product is damn too good. It offers a good display with a decent battery life. I actually bought it for regular usage and a little bit of gaming which it carries out quite well. I am very much satisfied with this product..Thank you SamsungYou nailed it..

"
"

  After one and half month it's batter charging stopped , when i connected to phone not  showing charging , when make phone switch off and then it's showing charging but some time not showing ,Bad product

"
"

  phone is poor performance...slow , screen touch also not good..better not to go for this option even of you have budget constraints.very disappointed and no help from Amzon..no replacement request accepted even phone issie reported withinh 5 days of arrival

"
"

  Do not buy, waste of money.Phone is heating, charging takes lot of time, network loses automalically , go for a better one ""Samsung"" losses it's quality here !

  I bought this mobile for my daughter online class on zoom.But this mobile is not supporting zoom ap.Incoming voice problem.I found this problem today and make up my mind to return this mobile but I found that amazon had closed the return door today.bad luck.no use of new mobile.

"
"

  I am very happy that i bought a new phone in my budget .About this phone . The phone is very good looking and very smooth .Little bit lagging problem otherwise its all okThanksParshant kumar

"
"

  Worst product after using one hour, the phone got dead and in the beginning unable to read the sim. Simply disappointed. If the same issue raised by so many customers, why amazon selling such defective products, without resolving such issues.

"
"

"
"

"
"

"
"

  To be honest.. This phone is meant for parents. I got this for my granny she was happy it's good for people who don't use phone much. It will not be durable for teenagers and people who live on phone a lot.... But a samsung phone @5k is too good.... Received on time... Thank you Amazon.

"
"

  The battery life is not good and the time taken to charge battery is very high. Moreover phone is getting turned off again and again and do not switch on easily.

"
"

   Last night i kept my phone for charging... But then today when I woke up i was trying to switch it on... But it was not switching on... Can you please help me with this problem as soon as possible... Please can u help me with this problem

"
"

  My dear friends don't buy it. It's cheating.. Mobile hanging is very often cannot call also.. Better buy a cheap less than 1k... Don't go for it.. Anyhow I returned it with lot of fight with amazon..

"
"

  I ordered this phone, but just one month only working, suddenly ph is not working . I don’t know what is that problem.

"
"

  I just purchased the phone on amazon .in a few weeks ago , but unfortunately it suddenly turned off and won't start again. After charging it for several times its just not working . I  bought the phone for Rs. 4999/  and the amount of money is really precious to me .

"
"

  After long time very compact smart device by samsungEntry level mobile user best buying chooseCamera averageBattery life more than one day usageScreen quality above average

"
"

  Processor is so slow that does not even support zoom without lag.  Front camera video quality very dark in normal light room.  Battery drains very fast in light uses. Colour reproduction of the screen is not so good. At the price point of 6499 this product is wastage of money.

"
"

  I think this phone is perfect for general useIt has good battery backup,Comes out of the box Android 10 based on Android one program no bloatware and very smooth UI.The thickness of the phone is very good no need of back cover because of the texture.

"
"

  if you want to gift a phone to ur parents then this is best phone. Battery stays i think easily for a day without heavy usage. but u cant play high end games like cod or pubg in this. and if you are going to buy it then buy the 2gb variant

"
"

  Slow interface and all apps are on go version which does not work to its full potential.

"
"

  Samsung M01 over all a good and budget phone by its looks and price but there are a big problem in phone and It  becomes to hot during call and use of internet over cellular network . I hope this will not be in all future handsets and company will take acre this problem.

"
"

  Product was delivered before the time. Though simple and small in size it has a smooth touch with all basic facility like any other smart phone.

"
"

  Screen quality very impressive,Light weight and handy,Looks very Cute,Sound quality is great,Only RAM is less, but the price also matters.Overall a good deal and nice product from Samsung. 👍

"
"

  Phone is awesome till now..battery is also good, camera quality is also good overall in this range samsung delivered good phone . Best part is that, it is very light in weight ,very handy and all apps are run very smooth.

"
"

  Galaxy M01 core is really best smartphone for normal use...Display quality is superb... And battery backup is also good...Overall Product is very good in everything

"
"

  Phone is good with nice display, battery and response time. But just forget that it comes with a camera. Camera is not usable for a photo or a video.

"
"

  Serves best for basic users,I took for my mother who only uses whatsapp and calls only

"
"

  It's a small phone but but feels jus like an iphone. It's really cool and compact. Perfect budget phone. The selfie camera isnt great but back camera is awesome.

"
"

  I bought Samsung M01 core on 15'th aug and today  ( within a week ) it has stopped working. Now I am struggling to find service center and reach out to Sansung

"
"

  THANK YOU SAMSUNG MOBILE LTDI AM BUYING M01 THIS PHONE IS VERY GOOD GIFT FOR MY WIFE COMFORT MOBILE GOOD FOR GIRLS👩‍⚕️👩‍🎓👩‍⚖️ THANK YOU AMAZON

"
"

  After using this mobile for just one week I came to the conclusion that this mobile is a failure model since it has a high amount of heating problems during charging and very poor battery. I returned this product within a week and switched to another mobile.

"
"

  This phone is not performing as expected. Phone is hang most of the times and getting warm very often.I have a very bad feedback on this phone as it stop responding with in 15 days of use. This is not expected from Samsung.

"
"

  Disatisfied with the product. The sound and mic are not good. Amazom has replaced a product but it is with same issue. Hence returning for refund. I will.go with different brand now. Not satisfied with samsung now.  They are cmning dwn on quality

"
"

"
"

  Good Mobile.

"
"

  Don't ever buy this phone, within 5 days my Phone is dead! Performance was lagging since 2nd day, battery life is very poor, takes a lot if time to charge.Now I have requested to return but they aren't even considering my request!

"
"

  Must buy according to price.Very smooth and friendly user interface.Camera quality is very good.Samsung is a very reputed and good brand providing top features in this price segment.

"
"

  I got this Samsung Galaxy M01 Core on September 05th and this mobile is not been working from September 14th onwards without having any damages. It's automatically switched off and we we were tried to switched on but not able to do, so please help me.

"
"

  After one day the phone has become dead. Even after full charge it is not working. Please let me know how to return.

"
"

  Battery is worst part of this phone.At this price nothing much expected.Too much lag or hanging freezing alote.Just use it for calling and WhatsApp only.

"
"

  Cheap qualityI love Samsung but found cheap qualityThe cable wire used for changer along with sim tray wrose Chinese itemMade mistake

"
"

  My humble request don't buy this product. Completely 3rd class product and not even worth of 1000 Rs. In all aspects thus model got failed . Don't fall into the trap by seeing the price and AMAZON don't even provide return option for this product.

"
"

  Third class product I cant keep it even for free and now amazon is making foolosh by ssying to dounload fake aaps in witch costumers had maken comments that this is fake

"
"

  Delivered 15.8.2020. The phone just stops working  every  2-3 days and needs to be taken to Samsung dealer. It’s absolutely useless. While charging it gets very heated.

"
"

  This is good for 2nd phone look wise good, average battery life & camera quality, full value of money, services of Amazon is good delived in time

"
"

  Return window is closed and phone stop working in 15days..... please don't buy this phone

"
"

  Phone is good , rear camera good,front camera average, battery life good, display size in length good but width narrow ,price good , weight perfect, charging late,But one problem delivery is lateI received phone after due date....

"
"

  Pathetic Service by amazon. Providing defective piece with no option to exchange it for a better model.

"
"

  tHIS IS REALLY SURPRISING THAT THE PHONE IS DEAD AFTER USING 15 DAYS.

"
"

  It's really value for money and light weight.  I have purchased both Samsung Galaxy M01 Core 1GB and Samsung Galaxy M01 Core 2GB .

"
"

  Good product but i given 4star because size is too small ....

"
"

  This brand new mobile after inserting the SIM CARD and started downloading the apps it worked for just five minutes and screen got switched off and is not getting on from then on. It is the worst product that I have bought in Amazon.

"
"

  Product is fine enough to use but  more expected from samsung price is under 5500 improve your charger it's take 6..7hrs to charge full

"
"

  Would like to thank the Amazon Delivery team for the quicker Delivery.It's a Good Product to use and user-friendly with basic features.Recommended for Secondary phone or Minimal usage Smartphone.

"
"

  It heats up very quickly and stops running..I was return the product but this product return policy it's not available ... I hated Amazon .. so cheap Amazon company .. it's company terms and conditions it's totally lie.. .

"
"

  its good n value fr money n more over brands says everything .me n my whole family using samsung n nw my charity hv donated this phone to a girl ......she too like it ....

"
"

  Thanka Samsung and Amazon for providing a phone affordable to my pocket that enables my wife to help kida in their  online study. Thanks Samsumg once again to help my family in undisturbed learning.Thanks !!!!!!

"
"

  Totally disappointed in Amazon.After reading other people's reviews, I came to know many customers have received defective phones and are struggling for replacement.Not expecting this for 'Amazon fulfilled' product.

"
"

  Please don’t buy this phone. Very slow. Poor audio quality. Poor battery life. It’s just only 11 days since I bought it.

"
"

  1. Good product.2. Price is justified but mobile is of small size with less features.3. Good mobile for voice, video and data communication.4. Camera is average.5. Battery backup is also good.

"
"

  i dont know what is the problem with this mobile. after two weeks of useage, its not working now. its not evening turning on. China mobiles would work longer than this.

"
"

  I have used many Samsung mobiles. I find them user friendly. Featues are good in Samsung Galaxy M01 Core.  Only problem with Samsung mobile is it has too many inbuild software.

"
"

  Weak processor. Weak camera. Average battery life. I bought for 6499 and after 10 days Amazon was selling it for 5999. Phone hangs while doing daily work. It gives ok type user experience only.

"
"

  Phone is getting heated within 5 min of uses, Screen was very sluggish... While speaking over phone won't able to hold phone... Battery will drain like 5 years old phone...

"
"

  Decent phone ideal for those who switch from feature phone to smart phone or your parents. M not saying that, everything is top notch features in this phone but still brand name and the price segment is worthy to buying.

"
"

  Mobile is automatically dead while using and not came up even after charging. Very poor battery backup not even 2hr with playing and one day standby.Camera quality is too bad.Don't buy this mobile.

"
"

  Light weight, beautiful appearance that makes you fall for it, and of course value for money.

"
"

  This phone is quite sleek n compact. Its got good screen quality n picture clarity. Battery life is also too good for the price range. This is the best phone in market with a budget of 5k.

"
"

  Budget friendlyIt's a middle class choice

"
"

  luckily Phone is good , but package is opened before delivery. Without checking I had paid money to the delivery person. Please instruct the delivery persons to not to tamper the packing etc., Charger is very delicate.

"
"

  If you are looking for a alternative phone or to gift to your parents This one is really good. Coz as u all know less RAM and smaller size is enough and good for older people and to use as a temporary or alternatively

"
"

  Just OK Product, Samsung should reduce the pricing as compared to other Chinese phones. In that cost, Chinese phones offer premium service while Samsung doesn't

"
"

  RAM SPEEED DULL,CAMERA LIKE 5MP, CHARGING TIME 4 HRS,BACKUP OK.AFTER USING 4 DAYS POWER OFF AND NOT TURNING ON CUSTOMER CARE SAYING WAIT 7 DAYS FOR TECHNICIAN TO CONFIRM DEFECTIVE PIECE.*******DONT BUY*********

"
"

  Use product deliver to me.opne box in use the handset after sell

"
"

  Great value for money phone;pros:>Battery backup is awesome>has dark mode.>2GB ram and 32 GB storage with additional sd card slotCons:>taking lot of time to charge

"
"

  After one week of use , the product went dead and not able to restart. Unfortunately the return window is closed. So we son't know what to do with this faulty product.

"
"

  very quick delivery, phone is average built quality, performance is ok, but no Samsung special features in this phone, house peoples gift this phone, camera is average, battery medium average, screen look nice👍👍👍

"
"

  The mobile is very light weight. Although the phone is good.But it has a problem of OVER HEATING. You don not make a video call over 10 minute.  After 20 to 30 minutes use it runs slow.

"
"

  Don't buy this .waste of money ...over heating and hang problem ...no return no replace ...dont buy from this seller

"
"

  On 15 th day of delivery of mobile, mobile got shut down automatically. Not started after several attempt.Called Amazon, they said sorry could not help.

"
"

  It's good at this price range. Battery life shoul be extended a little more and camera should be improved too. I'm impressed by looking this type of screen quality at this price range. Well done Samsung👍

"
"

  The Phone has gone totally dead after 7 days...Is it manufacturing defect or is it due to delivery of substandard items....It needs to be replace.... process of warranty...its cumberson through online...

"
"

  I have received a call from technician Amazon,so very helpful,,mobile is going well now

"
"

  Overall phone is good but the internet calling and camera is not at it's best. Battery life also okay and it is in budget

"
"

  Value for money, donot expect much,its good

"
"

  Worst phone ever seen. The phone doesnt work, gets switched off within 2 days and never gets on. I got this phone replaced 2 times and still faced same issue.Dont buy is my review!

"
"

  Heating issues and battery  drains at rapid speed..

"
"

  Good design and battery, overall a good phone at this price range but I am getting some heating issues but not a deal breaker.

"
"

"
"

  Phone doesn't support some apps , while using the zoom app phone is strucking,sometimes audio and some times video is strucking, we can't see both in 1 time . It's performing like 256 mb ram phone not 2 gb ram .

"
"

  The product was not working from the 2nd day of purchase...even after escalating the problem to amazon..their response was hands free..now I have to depend on the seller for the service of NEWLY owned product...

"
"

  There is some issue in sim slot because of which network reception is poor

"
"

  Good product... But sometimes feeling that it's slow processing... its having 2GB RAM but not so effective performance

"
"

  I was sick of big phones tearing my pockets, at this price this is just amazing, thanks a million samsung, like always,

"
"

  This phone is worst... After one month the phone is dead and not charging also. I am not sure if this covers in warranty and it is additional work to go to service center.

"
"

  Very nice product..... I know that Samsung is the best Electronics Brand so I brought this Phone..... I am glad for use this..... Phone on top ranked by me I guve 5 stars of this Phone.....

"
"

  Within five days of purchase, problem occur  in display. Now the phone under dead condition. I have to run to service centre. All service center are too far from my location. So total waste and mental torture.

"
"

  Value for money.. good clarity, great storage space.Some times the mobile hangs with no response. To full charge, it takes close to 2 hours

"
"

  Battery got.discharged suddenly and did not wake up normally....samsung support advise to wake up using vol key+power key..it started again...otherwise value for money..good phone

"
"

  This phone is one of the best purchases i have ever made. It is best for whatsapp,facebook and other social media apps.Battery life is also good.Sound quality is upto the mark.Camera is also good. Must buy !!

"
"

  Product is very bad.Product purchased on 24th Sep and mobile is dead on 1st Oct.Replace window also closed on 1st Sep.What to do in this situation. Amazon should look into the matter for immediate replacement

"
"

  My phone just suddenly stop working and the display is off it is not getting switch on or off please tell me what to do. This happened when i was using my phones hotspot

"
"

  Good one in this range.2,32 is goodBattery should be 4000mah to fulfill all requirements but as Samsung is a famous brand so can't expect everything in such low cost

"
"

  Problem with signal the call will drop  in middle of conversation

"
"

  This phone stopped working after 4 hours of use. It didn’t get switched on again. Whenever  camera was on, it went very hot. Completely damaged product was given to me. Don’t buy from this seller.

"
"

  Good for this price

"
"

  Revie after 15 days of using mobile, battery comes for 4 to 5 hours in standby. Poor battery life

"
"

  Don't buy this handset... Not worth to pay this amount.. We cannot download anything#hangup#no music folder only Spotify.. Not happy with this handset can't return also.. Only replacement with same handset

"
"

"
"

   It has stop working only after 2 or 3 days of purchase which I have bought for my mother...and amazon is charging 349 rupees for looking the problem

"
"

  Its a good phone . Its Price is worth it . Display is amazing . Camera is kinda okay . The best thing is that it have android 10 go version .also light weighted .And last its trustworthy brand .

"
"

  Poor sound quality for music. Battery is draining faster, not continuing for one day in normal use. Not a good phone in ₹ 6499. Can it be possible to replace with other M series from the same seller ?

"
"

  Samsung is always best option as compare to other but I think the quality is not appropriate of this product. But in this buzet this is still the best choice..😇

"
"

  Very good one in this cost range.

"
"

  Nice , working fine up till now.. it’s been a month

"
"

  on the day of reciving the phone, it switched off all of a sudden and doesnt start back, when i tried to do a replacement , its a terrible return or help service from amazon. I didn't get any help.

"
"

  The phone charging is very very slow and suddenly goes into sleep mode. Once in sleep mode it does not charge and battery gets drained. It's not even one month and already visited the gallery twice

"
"

   I m really disappointed with the services , I purchased the phone as a gift for my mother-in-law after 2days phone goes completely dead ...bad experience

"
"

   Good

"
"

  Phone has switched off completely after 2 weeks of usage.Check for other reviews and you can find similar complaint.Do not waste your money with this phone.

"
"

  The phone is working smoothly.

"
"

  This is worst smartphone in market doesnot support many apps as well as take 7 hours in full charge. Screen is not very good and camera is worst if someone give this me in free i will not take it.

"
"

  Worst phone in every field.it takes too much time for charged

"
"

  Price withing the range of lower to middle price group. Features are great! one can go for it if they are looking for samsung ! No need to think much about it. nice.

"
"

  Battery Backup is goodScreen quality is opCamera is goodI like a mobile screen qualityNo lag No heatYou play a free fire in ultra graphics in 1gb ram in this mobile

"
"

  It’s not even been a day we’ve had it and it doesn’t turn on. Called Amazon and they say they’d send a technician!?? Ridiculous- why won’t they replace it?

"
"

  Battery was not charging from day 1, it always shows 30%

"
"

  Though the phone was worth it money but it stopped working after a day or three i have called the amazon service agent and they said tomorrow they will call waiting for it.

"
"

  Battery Life : ok at this price.Camera quality: don't use in night.  In Light Camera Performance is Tooo Good.Overall  : this phone nice choice for your parents

"
"

  I purchased a new phone on 12 Aug 2020, now it's suddenly switched off and tried my best to switch on but unable, so total waste of money

"
"

  Battery drains fast charging is very slowHeating issueIf you want to online classes or play a gameYour fingers feel burnBut phone is enough to that price segment

"
"

  Good mobile with in the budget . Hardy set with good quality but camera is not so good but overall it gives peace of mind

"
"

  Product was faulty. This mobile automatically got switched off. I also faced with difficulty while charging this phone. I would suggest spend few thousand rupees extra & buy another product

"
"

  Some functions are not available for better battery life

"
"

  The video calling and zoom application is not working with this phone. It is having audio issues only at the times of video call and zoom meeting.other than that all are in good condition.

"
"

  Worst experience of life in buying the mobile. Amazon not able to replace the faculty piece. Phone is dead on the date of delivery. My appeal to the customers not buy products from Amazon.

"
"

  Did not meet basic expectations

"
"

  Good phone to use as secondary. Light weight. Very difficult to find tempered glass for the phone.Camera very average. Overall a very average phone. Did not find any cons as of now.

"
"

  Nice Phone  this price.

"
"

  Lightweight,suitable as a second phone,senior citizens will like it.sufficient m emory for apps,my earlier samsung on 5 was lacking in memory.smooth perormance.a perfect gift to parents.

"
"

  the best part of this phone is very sleek in the model and handy lighter in weight. Worst part very very slow like an earthworm. I don't think its value for money...!

"
"

  The battery life is pathetic and the phone is turning off automatically. Would suggest not to buy this phone.Amazon support is also poor and they have refused to return the phone

"
"

  Budget phone very good it’s awesome perfect phone in low range price price is lesser than redmi phonesI got world’s best brand phone for 5.5k

"
"

  Worst phone ever purchased no battery life no good to use and stopped working just after 1 month and no service total waste of money... disguisting and not recommended at all

  You can use the mobile phone as a free ironing box... The phone gets Very very hot.. can't use it for normal data usage...worst one....

"
"

   I had just purchased Samsung Galaxy core M01 after a week the is just not working I had changed it 3 hr still it is power off.

"
"

  Value for money

"
"

  Phone comes with 1gb of ram, hangs a lot and switches off automatically. It's better spend 1 or 2k more and buy a mobile with 2+gb ram & better hardware

"
"

  Great piece for basic home use.

"
"

  Slik and handy. Value for money received the item within a day.

"
"

  Phone battery is damaged that phone get hest up in 2 mins  and no camera quality.i want my refund as its harmful to me  that can blast in my hands.i want to know about it

"
"

  Easy to carry in hand.i was looking for mobile phones under 5k because my purpose only what app for video call.so this phone is working good.Thanks Amazon & Samsung

"
"

  Good phone

"
"

  Don't buy this mobile phone ever.... it's just like old technology phone. Not useful even simple use.Total waste of money.

"
"

  Phone is very excellent according to its price.And its features are also very good.And it is very helpful for students who want to attend online class.

"
"

  It not support directly video call from jio and Airtel Sim,On average good product in low budget, but avoid purchase because volte vedeo call not support.

"
"

  worst product and support from amazon this product dont have any refund policy and mobile has heating issue.even you can not purchase any other product from same brand .

"
"

  Initiatlly I was using only single sim card now today I have inserted second Sim but second slot of the phone is not working.  Kindly resolve this issue on top priority.

"
"

  Very bad phone..Dont trust because just it is from samsungbattery is getting hot very soon,  dont buy  this phone..better to go for mi,  realme..

"
"

  Best phone under this budget.

"
"

  Good phone and value for moneyBattery:excellentDisplay:goodCamera:goodSlightly hanging  problemsAnd heating sometimes  occurs....

"
"

  Very good basic mobile. Price is cheap.

"
"

  U cannot expect more at this price 😁🔥

"
"

  Very nice. Bought it for mom.very happy. Thank you Amazon Battery is not good

"
"

  Don't buy this when I received the product it's display is not working properly and chargers is not going to charge battery and when I file return for this no body came

"
"

  Over heating problem

"
"

  This is a best smartphone in this range. We bought two mobile both are working fine.  Battary is fine. Screen size is also good. Overall phone is best for this budget.

"
"

  Phone permanently dead within 15 days. No replacement after 1 week as Amazon displayed. Now what can I do? Thinking for go to consumer court instead of service centre.

"
"

  Bad camera quality, exchanged with Samsung on5 which has same camera feature but on5 was far better. Heating problem as well, battery drains out very quickly

"
"

  As per budget this is a good phone. Camera &screen quality is good but battery power is not so satisfactory .Thanks to Samsung for giving a smartphone in this budget.

"
"

  Overall a good product from Samsung at this price range. The battery life is average.  The camera quality is good. The display screen is large . Connectivity is good.

"
"

  Battery drain very fast, mobile heats too much,inncessary pre-installed Applications, and important thing don't buy this product from amazon, because of poor service

"
"

  WHILE IN OPERATION THE PHONE GET HEATED UP TOO MUCH,BATTERY LIFE OKCAMERA FUNCTIONING OKNEED IMMEDIATE REPLACEMENT OF MOBILE SET AS FEEL DEFECTIVE.

"
"

  Do not buy this phone ever & replacement is also dead within 3 days. Samsung for India is a bogus initiative and misleading. This phone is a failure model.

"
"

  It is completely dead after using one week.. The mobile just shut off automatically and doesn't turn on.. waste of money.. i need it to be replaced at any cost....

"
"

  I worst my money. After 8hours charging when I switch on the mobile is heating.And i don't have no option for return. Only for repair solutions in amazon aap

"
"

  Nice product ...sleek phone with good quality

"
"

  This phone can be use as secondary/for aged person.screen size little bit small for regular use.

"
"

  Very good mobile phone in its price range.Battery life is good.Camera quality is  normal,long screen good for gaming and video playing,slim design,value of money.

"
"

  best phone for just basic uses,if you are a hardcore gamer or a mobi addict i won't recommend it,it gives performance as it worth,best phone to buy at this price.

"
"

  Not working that day

"
"

  This is an overall good phone.But in case of camera quality it's not good. More than that the processor speed is low and the phone starts heat!

"
"

  It's just awesome, the camera, battery and looks worth buying. I bought this for my Dad for his birthday. Thank you Amazon for timely delivery.

"
"

  My samsung m01 core battery back up is very low and it takes more than 8 hours to get charged completely.... Kindly replace my battery with in guarantee period..

"
