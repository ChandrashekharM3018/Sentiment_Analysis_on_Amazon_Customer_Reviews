"  The phone comes with 4gb RAM and talks about clocking excess of 2 GHz clock speed. The camera is ok and gives out decent pics. Battery life is good but sadly, no fast/dash/vooc charging available.PUBg games works on Low settings so very big disappointment here. Too much lag when try to change the Graphics settings. I would say the product description was very misleading in claiming that Games are supported.Keeping the price in mind, I would say decent phone but not worth going for if you wanted specs to match the performance.",-0.968,negative

"  I am getting issue with my phone, issue started after return window close on 26th August voice Eco starts and sometimes videos become blur. Complaint on 4 or 5th SEP. to amazon cce said return window close have to go to service center, there Eco issue resolve but getting that video issue at times now new issue starts. When recieve call light didn't turn on automatically have to check phone after listening ringtone. I think there is some manufacturing in it, tired of visiting service center again and again. Amazon team you have to do something.",-0.3071,negative

"  i purchase it on 18 and i got the delivery on 19. And on 27 the phone screen stopped working. We cannot see any thing on the screen. We can only here ringtone, but nothing on screen. Also now the speaker is also having problem. Speaker is blasted (phat gaya hai). I have removed the sim and started using old phone now.I think the Amazon and the supplier have shipped me a used or refurbished phone. Instead of a new one. And big problem , is that i cannot even return it now. And now this phone is totally turned off. Cannot see if it is charging, or not, cannot see anything on screen. Now amazon is telling me to contact manufacturer for this.I am not paying any thing for this.",-0.6652,negative
