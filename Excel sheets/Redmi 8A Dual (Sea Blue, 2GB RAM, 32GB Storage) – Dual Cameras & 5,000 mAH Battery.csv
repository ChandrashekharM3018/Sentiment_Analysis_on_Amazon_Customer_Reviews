"  I bought this for an older relative who needed a basic smartphone. Given its pricepoint I didn't have much expectations for the Redmi 8A but after unboxing and setting it up I have to admit - it looks and behaves like a premium phone!In almost every aspect 8A has been upgraded over the 7A. While it doesn't have a fingerprint sensor, the camera is much better than I expected. There is a bit of lag in opening and switching between multiple applications but it shouldn't be a big deal for people with basic usage patterns. To facilitate better grip, 8A has a non-glassy back that is textured. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by the phone given its pricepoint. For its target demographic (light users who might just want to take some pics, use social media and the occasional app) this is a great phone.The only drawback I felt is that Xiaomi has been aggressive in bundling custom apps in the phone that deliver lots of ads and sponsored videos by default (and it requires some know-how to disable them).",0.9721,positive

"  Redmi 8A Dual (Sea Blue, 3GB RAM)Battery: The smartphone comes with a 5000 mAH battery. For an average user, this is great.OS: The preinstalled OS Android 9 with MIUI Global 11.0.2. user interface.OS Volume Bug: There is a bug which constantly causes volume to drop to zero. You can fix this bug by System Update.Camera: Pretty decent camera. There are already too many reviews on this, so I'm not gonna comment.Bloatware: Probably, this is what bugs me most in android devices. There are bunch of preinstalled apps and games. Most of them are unnecessary for you. You can remove most of them but not all. This is pathetic.RAM Usage: After removing bloatwares, the system takes around 1.1 GB of RAM, so you will have 1.9 GB of RAM which is enough for the most users.No Heating Issue: I'm not a gamer, but if you are an average you will not find any heating issue, at least most of the time.",0.1406,positive

"  I was a little sceptical while purchasing this phone as it was my first Chinese phone as I was fed up with my mom's rough phone usage! She successfully killed many good brand phones like HTC, Samsung etc so wanted something really cheap this time. I paid 7500 for this phone even though the old price was 6500! Due to lockdown, I had no option to roam around! The best part was I got 3100Rs for old Samsung J4 in exchange with no mess, whereas local shopkeepers were talking about 1k resale value lol! That was less than year old phone though but still, I was happy with buyback price so went ahead and decided to buy this phone even though there are plenty of negative reviews!Now coming to the phone I didn't feel like I'm holding some entry-level Chinese phone! It's a great phone for ladies who use phone just for WhatsApp and calling. No problems found so far. The battery is excellent. Colour is catchy. The best part is Type C slot as all other phones in my home have Type C! Best phone for basic users. Not for Pro. I own LG G7, Oneplus etc so I know what premium means! So I won't call it premium but it's definitely worth a try! Consider the life of a couple of years and proceed as even branded entry-level phones die sooner or later. It's been only 2 days so can't say much about it. If there seems to be any problem I'll update my review.",0.9809,positive
"  Pros:*Cool battery*Type c charger and fast charging*Corning Gorilla glass 5(toughness)*Splashproof*Wireless FMCons:*Too many pre-installed unwanted apps which would kill internal storage and ram space*No private safe, but covered with second space. (Hide option is provided for folder as a whole, not for individual file/image. That too without password protection!! Too bad*processor performance is not great but good.*presence of Finger print sensor would be great*Both the cameras are too bad.. would feel like having 5 mp camera.*Weights heavy due to 5k battery",-0.8984,negative

"  In this price segment this is the worst mobile I have used yet.

"  First off all it is a good product for this price. Good looking and smooth. But..The camera is too cheap that it is a waste having dual camera for this quality. May be it's software issue.And IT LACK A FINGER PRINT SENSORbut HAVE FACE UNLOCK INSTEAD,it is pretty good.The phone is LITTLE BIT BULKY may be because of 5000mAh battery pack.Anyway it's is good as a budget phone",0.7242,positive

"  Defective product received as with many other users. The phone has ghost touch problem. This seems to be the issue with this phone model and also in general with Redmi phones as is apparent from several online forums. Since I only noticed this problem after the return period was over, Amazon wasn't ready to extend any support on this. The problem has only aggravated since and the phone now dials numbers  or opens apps on its own. For the first time in my life, I have faced a hardware issue with a brand new phone. Redmi QC seems to be very lax. Now I need to take it to the service centre. It is really annoying to send a new product for servicing and be left without a phone after spending your hard earned money.",-0.9535,negative

"  This is one of the cheap smartphone according to its features.Battery capacity is amazingCamera is ok not so good.Two things I dislike about this Phone that it is made in China not only mobile, adapter is also made in China and the second thing is 10w charger is given in this box we have to purchase separately.Sound quality is clear and too lound I liked this also.Overall I like this Phone.Note: We have to use invoice as a warrenty card to claim our warrentybecause Warrenty Card is not separately given inside the box. So I request the seller to give invoice in good condition to customers because I have not received invoice in good condition.

  I purchased Redmi 8A Dual on 27th July 2020. It has 7 days return policy. After 15 days the phone was switched off automatically and after several trying phone did not power on. I go to the redmi authorized service center for servicing of the mobile phone. They tell me that the phone was water damaged. Due to this I did not get any warranty. But they did not open the mobile in front of me for checking.  Worst quality of phone I ever seen and worst quality of service center they have.,-0.9354,negative

"  I had this Smartphone for my mother. Now after using it about 15 days , I can assure you that Xiaomi has arranged a great deal , but by the time passes new Smartphones will be it's competitors. So remember it's time and current scenario I can completely recommend you to buy this phone if your budget is below 10k .I had ordered 3gb+32gb sea blue variant and got delivered within 5 days , thanks to Amazon. The phone supports 18 watt fast charging and has 5000 mah battery and face unlock , which are unexpected in this price range. But Snapdragon 439 processor is not eligible to do any hard work . I would recommend to use this phone for basics.",0.952,positive
"  Important tip: Buy 3GB version to run free fire and other apps without any lags (Available Ram 2 GB/3GB).●Mobile is very good without any lags till now. (using Messenger, Whatsapp, gaana app simultaneously).●Don't buy this mobile for playing high config games. Processsor and graphics hardware are of average quality.●The battery is huge in this mobile. Charging with realme 20W charger took around 2 hours (10% to 95%).●The front and back camera is good in this price segment, and don't expect a quality like 15k mobiles.●The screen comes with a corning gorila 5, with no extra thin screen protector which other phones has.●Face unlock is good but sometimes doesn't work in low light. That is completely ok in 8k mobile.●Now the main thing which I don't like on this phone is useless apps which can't be uninstall. (like MiPay, MI secure vault, etc MI apps). And we can't trust these apps as government banned many MI apps because Xiomi read  and store every activity you do with those apps. So only use google apps to secure data and personal details. BTW it is still not reliable because MI11 OS also can read all your data. Some MI apps has own T&Cs which no one reads before opening. So use Xiomi phones carefully and don't store any banks information or passwords.",0.2924,positive

"  I have upgraded from 7a to 8a, this series was released just three months after the earlier version.The battery🔋 which is 5000mah doesn't seem to be showing lot of difference from the 4000mah on the previous 7a. The only negative being the weight of the phone is a little heavier than the previous one. The blue color looks great but the phone is not easy to hold, you have to add back cover with a grip.Camera is good but the front camera has a lot of AI in it. When I took a picture with the back and front camera, the front looked too bright with a lot of brightness.Call quality is very good and it sounds almost like Nokia quality. Videos look good.

"  The phone is good for the average user. I can say the one who needs streaming apps, whatsApp, Facebook and similar other app will love the phone. Everything is as per expectation. Would have surely liked the product if it was made in India. The model I received is Made in China. Battey backup is good. I am not into much of camera but it comes with 13MP which is good from business point of view.Face recognition is working 7/10 times. No fingerprint scensor. But it's okay for few people like us. Storage is more than enough with 53GB. And 3 GB RAM works well with all apps I mentioned.",0.9408,positive
  Defective product. Started auto shutoff and on after just completion of return date. I have purchased it on 12th July 2020.

They should check thoroughly before delivering at the cost of their reputation.,-0.7251,negative
"  This is the third Xiaomi product I'm purchasing but this time I'm highly disappointed. 8A phone is no different than Redmi 7A except that this is quite bulky to hold and has better battery life and comes with a C-type charger. Redmi 7A is a lot better than 8A in terms of design. Don't go for the Blue coloured one of 8A, cos it has a funny shade than what's seen in the pictures. Camera claims to have 13mp lens but has no quality of even an 8mp Samsung phone. Also has poor settings with so much beautifying filter which makes everything look so lighter in shade, polished and cartoon like. Xiaomi used to deliver top notch quality phones and camera at the same price range when they launched phones during 2015-16 time period. Xiaomi is compromising a lot on camera quality. The touch response of the handset i received is slow. Also they're refusing to return the product and instead they're giving me a replacement of the same phone which I don't want. When we contacted the Amazon customer care they're asking us to place the return after accepting the second replacement. Why this complication when you can return the first right away than make everyone take double risk of travel in this time of pandemic.",0.9392,positive
"  I take online classes so video and voice must be clear. The mobile should be slim and light weight to put on tripod.  I needed a rough and tough high performance phone within my budget constraints.C type charging pin means long pin life. Battery backup is superb, Speaker sound is quite loud, slim body and vibrant colours look smart. Camera is more than enough to fulfill my need as an amateur photographer.Display and handling is quite good. Normal apps work smoothly and I don't use phone for gaming. WhatsApp, Facebook, youtube, etc work well and 64GB Storage with 3GB RAM is more than enough for me.",0.9612,positive

"  Writing this review after using this device for 2 months.Delivery was super fast (Delivered in just 2 days)..Pros :-1. Big Display (This 6'22"" display is really good for day to day usage).2. Battery & Charging - 5000 mAH battery lasts upto 2 to 2½ days for a normal usage and this supports 18w fast charger and also have USB Type-C cable which is excellent in this price range.3. Look & Feel - This entry level smartphone have a polycarbonate back which is decent and have a good grip..., And it also have Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protection in the front.4. Face Unlock feature - This smartphone doesn't have fingerprint sensor but have a face Unlock which is quite reliable and works well..Cons :-1. Processor - They should have gone for Snapdragon 450 or 460, SD439 is old processor.2.  Bloatwares - There are adds in this device & also have few bloatwares like Mi Community & Helo App which are banned by Indian Government..Overall this is a good upgrade from Redmi 7A at this price range..If you want an entry level smartphone this one is good.",0.9449,positive
  This is a great product under the 10k range..personally loved it.Though it doesn't have finger print sensor its beautifully designed and can be used.. i've bought this for my father n he loves it.. battery life is 5000mah which is huge and camera quality is good for this range. . so you can definitely give a try,0.9737,positive
"  The phone is beautifully designed, including the patterned plastic back and the dewdrop notch design. the battery life is good but it could be better but since it's miui,there isn't much you can get apart from ads in the UI which are hard to turn off,there's a lot of invasive bloatware and adware,also the camera quality is average,there was no need for a dual cam setup(I feel the lower camera can be fake),the front cam is average too,I think should've gone with the 9i.

"  I have read the reviews before buying the mobile. So thought to give it a luck. After using for 1 day the mobile screen keep on touching itself from any part of the screen. The phone hangs a lot. Pubg runs good at times but a lot of time it lags. I checked the battery performance in setting, the screen itself consuming more than 94% of battery which makes battery drain rapidly. I have replaced it. Now got a replacement with tampered mobile box. However the packing was not tempered. To my surprise it is a used mobile. Fingerprint of former user was found on mobile screen and charger. The mi seal was broken and re-pasted and delivered to me. The seller think himself oversmart. Keep distributing used mobile to the customers. I have checked this mobile condition which is good at outside but the internet connectivity is very poor it does not go beyond 350kb at 2am midnight Jio 4G. Which goes beyond 2Mbps at this time in other mobile phone. Also charger is heated up when charging within 20 minutes and it's not 18W power charger. So i got a defective used product in replacement.  Now i  want my refund. I am not satisfied with this mobile. The conclusion is that if you are lucky enough than this mobile will work for a few day until replacement period is over or maximum 15 days later you will repent at your choice. Better put 1-2k more and get better mobile than this Redmi 8A Dual 3-32.",0.4325,positive

I got a replacement after I complained about lag issues and the second piece turned out to be worst than the first. Now I am stuck with this ""brick"" of a mobile forever. After a complaint about the replacement, Amazon sent a service expert who was unaware of my phone's problem.

"  Bought the phone for my wife when her phone screen was damaged. It was on offer on Amazon at the time and for its price, it seemed like a great deal. Note that the spec says 2GB ram, 32GB storage. Being a Samsung user, i wasn't sure how the experience would be. However i am happy to report that aside from a few hitches, this phone is excellent. The 2GB may seem less but i never noticed any issue when using fb or youtube. I cannot recommend it for intensive gaming but for casual use like watching videos etc, it is fine. I havent tested the selfie cam yet but the front cam is pretty good. There is no fingerprint sensor. Even though the phone supports fast charging, there is no fast charger provided. No earphones. Basically just the phone and regular charger. Ensure you remove the preinstalled bloatware and banned chinese software. Finally an excellent 5000 mAh battery that lasts almost a whole day on active use. All in all, a phone perfect for the casual user.",0.9836,positive

"  I purchased this product only cause my one plus was broke and I couldn’t get it repaired on time. I needed a spare phone for emergencies and I bought this product considering the cost factor. I’ve never used any of RedMi products and since RedMi claim that they are the products for cost I wanted to give it a try. As I expected, it’s the worst performance phone. I’m not talking about the performance equal to a premium smartphone. I’m talking about basic use. The touch is worse. It taps automatically and makes the usage of phone a nightmare. Have to restart it multiple times to fix that issue temporarily. U never know when the same error occurs. Other than that, major thing is “THE DEVICE TURNS OFF ALL OF SUDDEN FROM NOWHERE AND WONT TURN ON AT ANY COST”. Nobody knows why that happened and will have to factory reset the device from device factory mode. Will never buy any of the RedMi products just because of price. I’d rather get a good quality product even if I have to pay a little more money.I’d not recommend at all be it any product coming from this company.",-0.9113,negative
"  Lots of useless manufacturer and google apps. You open the box and it feels like you're using someone else's phone. Additionally, they cant be uninstalled. Hogs up 14 GB of 32 GB space and you're left with only 18 GBs. And if you're using two sims you cant even insert a memory card to store pics/music or whatever.Ads everywhere! You open any of their apps, even the system apps, and adds are there to greet you.Does not come with a fingerprint senser.Battery life is decent but lets see how it works 6 months from now.Has an ugly(imo) screen tint as default. And for some reason, every time I restart I have to set the tint and turn off auto-brightness all over again.  Idk if it's a fault or I am not doing it right.Screen guard and back cover not included in the box as is the norm with some other manufacturers.Comparing it with Honor 8c which I bought last year for roughly the same price (8.3k), this phone's resolution is massively inferior to Honor's even though they both claim it to be 720 x 1520 pixels.Very disappointed and underwhelmed with this purchase. Only keeping it because it was the cheapest phone (among newer releases) in the 32gb/3gb category on amazon. You save your money to buy an entry level phone and still it doesn't feel personalised.

"  It's a little hard to use with one hand, and the keyboard doesn't seem to have one-handed mode, but the split screen feature and the screen brightness make up for that. This is the first smartphone I've used where the minimum brightness is satisfactory for use in a dark room. The dark mode and reading mode options are quite helpful, too. The screen is also resistant to damage, to a certain extent. The battery cannot be removed, but there seems to be a fair amount of ingress protection because of that.

  I've been using Xiaomis product from Its Note 4 launch and was satisfied by its performance as well as its manufacturing in India as all the box contains information that it is MADE IN INDIA but this was the 1st time i bought this phone and it doesnt have that MADE IN INDIA logo and it's clearly written over there on the phone that it's MADE IN CHINA😠 I've not expected this from #Redmi_India that they cannot afford a budget segment phones manufacturing in their own country 🤧🤕,0.1406,positive
  It has a problem. Of getting auto boot since day one.....recently it flashed with Android 10.....and since then it shuts down auto and it takes very firm press on the power button to boot.....and when u are doing this after every 2 hrs then quite a fun.....I will never buy MI product in my life......it was first n last time I did.....these cheap Chinese re-incarnation claiming to be made in India. .....I really don't believe with the quality it's packed with.....,-0.4019,negative
"  At the budget I didn't have any other choice. So bought this phone, totally a killer.Cons - signal reception not good and no fingerprint scanner.Pros - display and battery is awesome.I had issues with battery backup atfirst later on I turned off may things, which was automatically running in background. Now the battery is unbelievably good, mom is totally Happy with it.",0.7696,positive
  At this price range this is a good buy. The phone looks elegant and sleek.The camera is good outdoors in sunlight but in dark spaces it does not perform well. Again at this price it is worth it.The Ad ridden OS is a bit irritating but once the warranty is void one can install custom ROM.It is easy to handle and carry and the does not feel heavy even with the 5k battery.Did not face any overheating issues so far.I never play games so have nothing to comment on that front.Screen clarity is good and brightness in sunlight is also not an issue (I use dark mode)Overall a good buy but in a month or so you may get better models.,0.966,positive
"  I've used many phones in this budget segment from renowned brands. I was always skeptical about Redmi/Xiaomi. It was hard to make a decision of buying this phone. But to be honest, I'm totally moved! Be it the display, be it looks, usage, it is totally a power package. The amazing thing is, you're getting 5000 MAH battery in less than 8k ! Easily runs over 1.5 days with a full charge and average usage (multitasking, video streaming, browsing, social media). It also comes with 18W Fast Charging support. The display will blow your mind. Looks are quite good, could've been better. What is a drawback is it doesn't have a Fingerprint Sensor, which is a must for phones in this budget! Camera quality is ""just okay"".Lastly, I'm using this device for the last 4-5 days, didn't feel any lag though it comes with 2GB RAM, all credits to Redmi's amazing optimisation.You can go for it without a single doubt in your mind if your budget is right.",0.9907,positive
"  Very bad experience, just after 20 days, it is not working properly. Many times while using this ohone, it automatically closes all the apps and returns to home screen and then it just hangs and then we have to restart it to make it work again.",-0.5849,negative
"  I am using 2gb/32gb variant(white). Using it since 16 days and have not found a problem yet... No hanging/lagging...i have downloaded games of 250-300 mb and played it... The result was fantastic and neither it hanged nor became hot while playing or charging... Speaker sound is pretty good and Camera quality is superb in good lighting conditions mainly during day time (outdoors), no one can say it's a 8k below phone by looking it's camera performance due to SD processor and battery backup is good too....Conclusion:- This phone is for people who are not game addict and those who love photography but are know in budget... The phone performance is lag free for day to day usage and most importantly uninstall or disable the preloaded apps if you don't use it.",0.9563,positive
  The modem of this phone is very slow. It gives only half the actual speed. My other phone gives a speed of 90mbps on wifi whereas this phone give only 40 mbps on same network. Getting less than 1 mbps on LTE networks. Camera is below average.,0,positive
  Don't go for this phone unless your budget is very low.This phone doesn't have aby fingerprint scanner. Fast charger doesn't come in the box.Neither comes a back case or screen protector or headphone. You have to buy all those separately.Camera quality is also not good.My suggestion is to spend 1-2k extra and go for other good phones.,0.4404,positive
"  I would like to start with prosPros:1. After unboxing, the first feel and look is awesome. The aura x grip design on the back of the device is superb considering its price range which gives a premium feel while you are holding the device in your hands.2. The big 6.22 inch ips lcd display of resolution 720x1520. The viewing angles are good and comes with support of sunlight display which mean in outdoors one will not have a problem viewing this device. Due to its large screen content consuming is very good and the dot notch in the top middle of the screen does not annoy while watching videos or playing games. The display also comes with gorilla glass 5 protection which is very rare in this price segment and protects your device to some extent from scratches and drops.3. This device comes with p2i nano coating which means it can save the device from splashes of water to a certain extent. But do not dip it in water as it is not water resistant.4. This device comes with snapdragon 439 processor which is based on 12nm process. This chipset can go up to 2ghz and performs day to day task and gaming easily. Pubg lite and pubg mobile runs smoothly on this device. Pubg lite can go up to a maximum resolution of balanced at very high frame rates whereas pung mobile can go upto balanced with medium frame rates. Both games run smoothly without any lag or stutter.5. This device is powered by a 5000mah battery which gives a backup of upto 2 dys on average usage. But for heavy gamers and content viewers this device gives backup of upto a day on single charge. This device comes with 10ww charge and if you charge with 10w charger it takes around 2hr 30min but if you charge it by 18w charger it takes around 2hr.6. The camera on the back is 13+2 mp AI dual camera. The ai scene detection is good and fast. The backgroung blur during portrait mode is very good and the selfie camera is 8mp ai camera. This also support portrait mode but the blur could have been better. Both camera support 1080p recording at 30fps.7. Comes with face unlock and is pretty fast with proper lighting condition.Cons:1. The cameras could have been better.2. IR blaster is missing.3. Notification Led is missing.4. Fingerprint reader is missing.5. Both cameras struggles in low light conditions.6. Comes with miui with full of bloatwares and ads. But they can be disabled and and stopped.WARNING: For non chinese smartphone users if you buy this phone it will com with pre installed chinese apps banned by Indian government bu they will fix it with an ota update so not worry.My Opinion:After using this device I would recommend this device to buyers with budget under 10,000. Everything is good and the updates are also quick and timely. And no problem with the device.",0.9929,positive
  After 1 week of usage:Nice battery backup (5000 mah)Nice display qualityGood soundNice camera quality in this budget.Big displayFace lock available however no fingerprint scanner.As said on the box it support wireless FM but it doesn't support wireless FM you need to connect your headphone for FM frequency.Support Fast charging which is very useful thing.Overall nice phone to buy.Thanks to Amazon for the exchange offer.,0.8315,positive
"  Got my new redmi phone. Overall the phone is as per the features, but the quality of camera is not as per the advertisment, selfie camera is better than back camera, you can understand how the back camera is,  previously had Samsung phone with same mega pixel camera, it clicked so well, so here is the sincere request to all buyers, if looking for good camera, don't go for it,",0.9419,positive

"  Nice phone in this price range except bit big to handle . I personally recommend not go for this screen size, as it is very difficult to handle or pick call using one hand (mostly during driving or doing some other work). it is quite slippery, so you land up with cover which makes it too big to keep it in pocket.",0.6915,positive
  This review is for REDMI 8A DUAL 3GB RAM 32GB ROM(for use 21gb)Nice budget product. Large battery life last 1-2days. Camera is of average quality. Dual 4g standby. Charger given is of 10 watt. Type c port otg support. No fingerprint . Has face unlock. No ir blaster. Good sound and its quality. Sim tray is risky to use very delicate. Very less heating if you use it continuous,0.2247,positive
"  Not really value for money, a lot of bloatware comes pre-installed even in October 2020, many ads, faltu apps like hago, Zilli, etc. Are automatically installed within 24 to 48 hours of usage. xiaomi is cheating on everyone by showing they didn't give installed app but they automatically install it from their storage later. For specs you should go for other company phone this is overpriced by ₹500.Camera Quality is not even of 5MP. And front camera just exist for name. Once you see the quality you would not use it again",-0.1472,negative

  Worst product. But more disappointing is Amazon service. The phone started malfunctioning after a few days. First it started hanging and then began off and on all on a sudden.  The problem started just before an hour of scheduled replacement. Initially I thought it is a temporary problem. But when I discovered that the problem is permanent I tried for replacement. But the return window had closed just 5 minutes earlier. Because of 5 minutes delay Amazon didn't care for my repeated request.,-0.9676,negative
  Very poor product within 4 months the mobile hanged and when took to service centre and they flashed the memory and restarted it after 2 more restarts one more given to service centre and one at home now again hanged Service centre is now recommends change of mother board.
