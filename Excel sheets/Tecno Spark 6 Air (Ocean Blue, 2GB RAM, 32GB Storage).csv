"  all the specs sheet is loaded to attract the customer . looks like lucrative deal but the device is average and definitely remind you that it is cheap chinese phone. Even no cover is sold for this model anywhere in any website, neither provided in box . Its better to buy narzo 10A or realme C12  instead of this.dont fall prey for tripple camera. Only usable camera is 13 MP ( I mean to say bokeh is not good and i dont know for what third 2mp camera is ??? its just a gimmick). there is no dedicated speaker and earpiece works as speaker and it sounds like screaming noise when you play louder.In my view only plus point of this phone is it has 7 inch screen which is good for vedio and movie viewing experience)i bought this @ effective cost of 7200 with card offer so i can say its okay for money i paid. but if have to buy @ 7999 you have lot of better options",0.961,positive

"  After almost a week of using this phone my review is, Great build quality, battery can last easily a full day, great for students who are planning to buy a device for online classes and for studying in a tight budget, the phone doesn't lags or hangs unless you put too much stress on the phone, camera is amazing i can i see the a.i camera doing it's magic, stabilization in video is not very good, front camera is kind of disappointing for me it takes time to perfectly focus if you are taking some creative shots something like that, if you move a little bit also even an slight adjustments, very slight, while using the front camera the picture is just straight bad, i have used many phones and in them it's not the caseIt has bloatwares and stuff which u can't really uninstall for the majority, but some can be uninstalled and some can be disabled, majority of them, still not a great number of bloatwares but still a significant amount, the screen is great it's a big screen so it will take some time to get used to it, if you are not used to big screen phones or tablets or have never used it, screen is sometimes a bit laggy or unresponsive but i have seen that In many devices so that's a normal thing in ips lcd hd+ displays, picture quality is good, i guess a Little too sharp but again that to i have seen and used in many smartphones so if you have used something like that before you are good to go, and also it's a little contrasty when you're watching  some dark or not very bright videos like mostly the background is dark but not like watching sky at night, some video like that, not much of a issue, it also depends on the video also, the quality it has, that's not much of an issue but you should know that as a buyer, battery is great very useful for students and business personnelSo Pros:-BatteryRear Camera, 4 flash and front dual because screen flash sucks not a fanDisplay size and quality at this price is fair, i.e., hd+You get a case with plastic, screen or scratch guard onFingerprint scanner is fast and so the face unlock but in dark it is a little slow or sometimes doesn't work at all but in noticeably dark conditionsProcessor is fair plus the ram romIt has a25 octa core not p22 as shown in Cpu-Z  or any other app it's gpu is same in p22 and a22(which is a quad core so no way it's in this device as it has an octa core processor) and also the processor can go max up to 1.8ghz which only a25 does, rest have much higher clock speedCons:-Display sometimes is unresponsiveFront camera not a fanThe back panel is a little squishy or it gets pressed a little bit I don't know it's a flaw or just something they did willingly, but not a problem, it won't make any sound or you'll even notice it until you press itTHE PHONE KILLS THE APP THAT'S SADIT HAS A RATING OF 5 IN, DON'T KILL MY APPS, APPLICATIONAND IT'S MICRO INTELLIGENT THING CAN ANNOY YOU SO TURN IT OFF, BASICALLY WHAT IT DOES IT WHEN YOUR PHONE IS IN SLEEP AND IF YOU MOVE IT OR SHAKE IT A LITTLE BIT ALSO THE SCREEN GETS ON THAT'S SO ANNOYING AND USING A FLASH WITH THAT SETTING ON WHILE THE SCREEN IS OFF TURNS IT OFF AND AMBIENT MODE OF GOOGLE IS GOOD YOU CAN USE IT BUT SOMETIMES THAT TO GETS ANNOYINGDOESN'T HAVE A NOTIFICATION INDICATER JUST A LITTLE FRONT FLASH WHEN IT'S ON CHARGING",0.9823,positive

  Product is average...I write this review after five days use...Rear Camera is Good but front Camera is wrost. Only one thing is good with this product is its Battery ...back up is excellent. The most wrost is....it's Cover is not available at Amazon ...and also not available in any other online platform...it's just horrible....it's the moral responsible of Amazon to sell the Cover . Using with out cover is always risk of slipping from Hand and damage....So I request to the Team Amazon to arrange it's cover on priority,0.957,positive

"  This is the first time I'm writing a review because I'm very upset with Amazon and Techno brand.This phone has Plastic body, display is not satisfying.Battery take 4_5 hours to charge.No fast charging feature is available.Built quality could be better.Battery drains very rapidly.Phone use to get heated very frequently.Total waste of money.So i would not recommend people to go for Techno brand phones. I would prefer to go for Realme, redmi, or vivo. In the same amount i.e. 8k, you may get better quality product.I'm very disappointed with this product.

"  Been using the phone from last 4 days no big issues except in very rare moments because of 2 gb ram the phone lags but it happens almost like none , and for battery it gave me the best battery life which I have used in a smartphone from 96% of charge till 0% it took 17-18 hrs (including really heavy usage) though it does take time to charge maybe 3.5 hrs or soWell if you are a very light gamer or just an average user I would recommend this phone rather than other brands because in the end we just have to use insta , whatsapp and YouTube",0.8888,positive

"  Have been using Tecno phones in Africa in the past, brand was no surprise for me. What I found about phone after 7 days of use -->1. Successful to catch network in low signal areas . This is special because around the place I live, network signals fluctuate too much. Mike is better than other phones . (Tecno users know this well)2. Selfie camera is better than many branded phones, and that's what needed today for video conferencing. Dual flash gives presentable snaps in evenings and night times.3.  Display does its job if you are not ardent game player. For my son's video tutorials and Youtube it works well.4. Watching movies is pleasurable experience with long battery life at least we are sure of uninterrupted entertainment.5. Speaker is ordinary, but latching on to blue-tooth speakers hides its weakness.6. Lack of quality accessories in market is not so much devil, got a basic flip cover for fall protection.Overall it is moneysaver and also substitute for tablet , what is needed for the day. 5 star and recommended!",0.8702,positive
  The main drawback is ear piece works as loudspeaker and the sound is very annoying. No back cover is supplied with the phone. However with 2gb ram it's performance is very good. It's never lags with Android go edition. Good for multimedia and social networks. No fast charge it took almost 5+ hours to charge from 0 to 100%. I think spark power 2 is better option then this. Pls consider these points before purchasing this piece of crap.,0.4778,positive
