  It is working fast and it is best in low rate and 1to2days stand able battery because if we worked hard it standard on 1day if you prefer low work it will standard 2days and system updating fun touch os will stand this phone to a longer life and about camera quality it's front camera is really awesome and selfie camera is best.
