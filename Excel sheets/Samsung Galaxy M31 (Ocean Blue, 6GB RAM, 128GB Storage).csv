"  This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag. First time I ordered on the first day of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.Good:- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.- 6000 Mah battery is BIG- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good- Received next day by 11 AM !Not So Good:- Not that thin, but ok.- Doesn't have Samsung Dex- Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue at all.- Feels delicate in hand but a Rs.49 cover was good enough. Wrongly ordered black while the set is blue. Just 49 so will reorder the blue one as well :)- Called Samsung Store, but no information with them about availability date. Still no call from them.Feedback- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.Go for it without any doubt.",0.9977,positive

"  Lets just begin with the obvious. This phone's quality doesn't meet the claims made.Cons:1. Camera Quality: Picture quality is just awful. Its worse than a 8MP camera. The pixelization is obvious and it is definitely not a 64MP camera. Do not believe the claims Samsung might make. The quad camera is of no use as the macro camera reminds me of the decade when VGA cameras were common.2. Battery: Samsung may claim the battery will last for two days but it didnt last that long - no Netflix, Prime Video, heavy games being used. So that makes two of the biggest features useless.3. Amazon's Policy: In case you don't like the phone, Amazon has made sure you are stuck with it. The switch from 10 day ""return"" policy to 10 day ""replacement"" policy is dowright wrong! Hold onto the shutters physical mobile stores - your days are not over yet. When you do request for replacement, there is an inspection of the phone at buyer's site - which I understand but the fact that replacement will occur almost on the 10th day from my purchase still keeps me at unease.Pros:1. Display: The screen quality is good and has adjustment options for warm light and cold light.2. Performance: Streaming videos and playing heavy games was smooth for the first 4 days but then again Samsung is known for fast deterioration of performance, so I will keep my eyes and ears open.3. Sound: Speaker quality is okay but not upto the mark. In a noisy place you fail to hear the crispness and the boom.",-0.7397,negative

"  The phone was wrapped in dust. Although it was seal packed, still many dust were on screen and back side. It shows security concerns and Amazon, Samsung and seller must draw its attention. How dust can be reached in seal packed box? Now I'm lacking trust in Amazon,Samsung and seller. Either my phone was used or its components might have replaced, as in brand new phone,there exists no dusts because they are built in factory, but here shows how they are playing with the customer and their product.Phone is nice, large battery backup of more than 2 days, 6.4 display is big, camera is perfect and 6GB ram is enough for daily usage.

  Not a Samsung performance. It seems it was launched without proper test n trials. I already had M30 so decided to buy M31 (6GB). But got shocked to see the poor performance n battery life. The 64MP images can't be sent easily to someone on WhatsApp. Camera give errors now n then. Battery life worst then M30 which has 5000mh. Mobile heats on charging.,-0.9593,negative

"  1. First of all let me tell you  that previously I have used Moto G2, Moto G4 Play & Lenovo K8 Note.2. I'm writing this review after 3 days of usage, using the 128GB version.3. PROS.(a) A great delivery experience by Amazon, within 24hr delivery, the phone is sleek & stylish to look at.(b) Battery backup(6000MAh) is just awesome.  For an average user like me, it lasted for two days in a single full charge.(c) Very very smooth processor, as compared to other phones in this price range like Oppo and Mi. Works like a flash.(d) Brand value of Samsung at this price with the latest specs.(e) With quad camera & a 64MP main camera, pretty amazing photos are clicked. The low light camera is particularly helpful.(f) If you are a fan of AMOLED display, this is the phone for you.(g) No problem of overheating while usage or charging.4. CONS.(a) With a 15W charger, it is charging slow taking almost 2.5hrs for a full charge, especially when compared to OPPO VOOC charger.(b) Not a very rugged phone, you might need to use a back cover from Day 1.5. I'm satisfied with the phone & the experience it provides. Overall, I would totally recommend you to go for Samsung Galaxy M31, as at this price range, with the specs  & brand value of Samsung, this is the best buy. 👍",0.9911,positive
"  Not satisfied with the qualityDisplay quality is no adequateBody is made of plastic like materialI was using MI like 6 plus pro then 7 plus proFor a change I have purchased this product, the quality is not up to the mark when comparing to my old redmi note seriesThe sound quality is very worst.While making call with full volume it is not clear from the day of purchase.I am planning to go back to MI againWorst phone pls don't buyNot value for money",-0.351,negative
"  I purchased this as soon as it was launched and its one of the worst decision that i made. Selfie camera is blurry and clicks yellow pictures, phone lags in playback video, all of a sudden, video will disappear and only sound continues to play, back camera isn't that great as hyped, its very low in quality, body of the phone is more like a plastic and very low quality material, overall very dis-satisfied with the product. Amazon has agreed post diagnosis saying its a faulty piece  but does not give refund",-0.659,negative
"  HiI am using M31 Since 6/3/2020.Those who are interested to buy this set, please follow my real Review before buying M31.1) Phone Display is excellent. It is a good Video viewing experience.2) In Day light, Rear Camera photos are good but sometimes its colour is yellowish which is very bad effect in image. Even in Night light or low light Selfie is not clear, you have to use Night Mode but Outdoor Selfie is excellent. It has 8x Digital Zoom which is extra benefit. In this price Zoom Quality is not bad.3) 4K Video shot in both Real and Front Cameras, the Video Qualities are amazing.4) Fingerprint Scanner is good but Face unlock is Average.5) Battery Optimization is not good. At present, it takes around 3 hours to complete charge from 6 to 100%, which was previously 2.5 hrs. I do not use any high graphic App.6) It has no support of Secure Folder and Knox.I think that Samsung is required to update in section of Camera, Battery and to add Secure Folder App to compete other Chinese brand Like Xiaomi, Realme, Poco etc.Thanks.",0.9508,positive
  One of worst mobile and one of the worst brand. Better to purchase any other brand except Samsung.1. Heating issue2. Second sim works on 3g.3. Even its 6Gb ram works like 2gb ram phone.When I called amazon customer care they said I have to go to service center for this and they are telling to check through app.Its a f***ing phone please please please don't waste your money.And this is my last ever purchase from amazon.,0.8415,positive
"  Cons:Button position (power& volume) too highFingerprint reader too highHeats up a lot.Though the battery capacity is high, battery drains fast.A lot of bloatware. Removed loads of stuff, tons still left.A full charge with original charger and original cable (which is quite short) from 0-100 took 2 hours & 28 minutesSpeaker volume low.The receiver causes voice drop in phonecalls.Pros:Feels lightweightNice display.The camera is decent.Update 1:Drained the battery to 0% and switched it off and charged to 100% and the battery seems to hold charge longer.Update 2:Outgoing voice gets cut for a few seconds at a time consistently. Going to request a replacement.Update 3:Returned my M31, found the voice unclear and faced voice drop. When I put my SIM card into my old Moto G5S+ the recipient immediately recognizes the much better voice quality. I have to put the call on 100% volume to be able to hear at least a bit.",-0.1531,negative

"  I have been using this for 15-20 days now and I am even more disappointed!I have been using POCO F1 since the last 1.5 years and I regret to have chosen to move back to Samsung!I so miss my POCOFirst the pros1. The brand name - if you think it is one!2. The display - It's super AMOLED and it's brilliant3. The rear camera - clicks good enough photos4. Build - seems decentCons:1. The UI - It's a big duffer. Samsung's smart switch was a pathetic attempt to move the contacts etc. Had I not cross checked, I would have been crying2. The contact list - It seems like using an age old NoKia device today3. Virtual Buttons - They aren't customizable 😭. What kinda innovation is this4. Clear all apps - it kills the current app too😬. I killed my game many times while trying to fasten up this idiot device5. Gaming - The phone slows down in 10-15 minutes. It's anyways a slow device6. Front camera - it no better than an age old 2MP camera. The image processing is idiotic7. Notifications - This idiot forgets to send email notifications. I have to manually keep checking my emails😭. Believe me, I have tried all settings8. Notification Badges - Does not display any badges on the apps 😂🤣. You have to pull down the notification bar and keep checking9. Dual Apps: This idiot does not support dual apps. Only messengers are supported. I have two accounts on amazon and amazon is not supported in dual apps. Similarly I have two accounts to manage on Linkedin.The more I use this idiot device, the more it frustrates meAnyone who recommends Samsung can kindly stay away from me nowWhat a waste of Money this has been",-0.9567,negative

"  1) claims 21 hour of internet usage timing, i started using it after 100charged  but it barely last for 24 hour with 5 hour of heavy usage and even turned mobile in bettery saving mode.  so what is the point of carry that much heavy 191gm device all around.2) phone heats a lot while its charging ,like you can't even touch it at some point.3)internet bandwith speed in mobile as well as in wifi is not good. i had a samsung galaxy note3 where i get fast internet with same network. wanted to return this device but they had a very strict policy so you cannot return, you can only replace it.  even i am trying it for replacement it wont let me as i have to download balencco app and this app never say your phone is not working fine. i could have spend my money in buying other phone.bought on very first minute of release but al excitment turned down after seeing actual performance.",0.2271,positive

  Received it on time within 24 hours thumps up to amazon. Now Product. Done all the settings. I am using samsung after a long gap of 8-10 years. After Samsung Grand I had stopped using. So setting done now data transfer Samsung's smart switch option is fantastic. Everything I wanted to transfer got it. No problem at all .Now SIM transferred. Done OK it is dual 4G VOLTE and above all it is having separate slot for micro sd card. Effortless working.Now Camera. It has got lot of options. All I have not yet tried but for sure I have checked the quality of the photograph and the night mode is superb. What else you want to know rest of the things are written in detail and is true. Working very fine. Proud to won it. Nice Product. Samsung should keep competing iPhone,0.9883,positive

  Very poor performance.. camera is ok not bad .

  It's one of the good looking phone with stunning display & mammoth battery.Pros :1. One of the best display in the segment.( You'll feel it when you hold the phone for first time itself )2. Great battery life (6000 mAH ) with good optimisation.3. SAR rating - lowest one4.  Well weight balanced ( considering big mammoth battery )Cons :1. Samsung should have provided a case along with this ( hard to buy a case at initial days after launch _ phone is slippery and finger print & dust magnet )2. Camera is not so great as expected ( 64 MP)_ wide angle shots are lacking of details _ macro mode is also not great3. Not so great processorWho can buy : people who don't do heavy gaming & not camera oriented. Who looking for great battery & Samsung branding.,0.8915,positive
"  I found the phone to be mediocre in performance.Pros:1. Display: Trust me it’s amazing! You will love the vibrant colours. Images and videos look great in the Amoled screen.2. Battery: 1.5 days backup even after heavy usage.3. Camera: Good, but not excellent.Cons:1. Build: All plastic build, this might have helped in managing the weight, but I guess the durability is compromised.2. Night mode camera: Useless, all grainy and inconsistent photos. Other phones in this price range are way better.3. Zoom camera: Photos are grainy and lacks clarity.4. Face unlock: Mostly doesn’t work even after adding alternate looks.Verdict: You can buy this if you don’t like the Skins of Chinese brands, One UI 2.0 is heavy but better. Hardware wise some Chinese phones are better.",0.9737,positive

  I ordered in first sale after comparing all the phones at this range and i am satisfied with this phone but want to discuss some pros and consPros:1. Back Camera is good ( i compared it with oneplus 7 and samsung is good). No issues with picture quality with zoom also.2. Its a powerhouse with High Battery Life (For normal usage we can even use phone for 2 days)3. No lag or hanging problem till now due to 6Gb RAMCons:1. Front Camera is not as good as expected2. Finger Print sensor is back mounted while all other brands offering in screen fingerprint sensors at this range. ( disappointed at this and THIS IS MAIN REASON FOR 4 ⭐️)3. Handset configured like conplex android even after having many in built apps but no app for lock apps and seems to be complex,-0.1419,negative
"  The camera pictures hv a yellow tinge which makes orange look like yellow and red look like orange. I returned the first phone thinking it might be a defective piece.but the second phone also had the same problem. I had almost returned the second phone also but then I figured out that the problem is not camera. Display setting had color correction mode on by default and it gave a yellow tinge to anything you see on phone screenIf you face the same problem pl go to your display setting or search color correction and put it off. The phone wl return to normal colorsI am using it for last 3 days and quite satisfied with the phone. Battery lasted 2 days but no games,music,videos. I am hoping battery performance wl improve in few daysCamera pictures are goodLots of bloatware come with Samsung so had to uninstall/ disable them manually",0.359,positive

  Display quality is good. But one thing which I don't like about the camera is that we can't use flash light when we take shots with 64 MP lens. Low light photographs are also not upto the mark. Rest everything is fine.,-0.2881,negative
  I was using Redmi not 5 pro prior to this. I feel that phone was quite better than  this.Camara- though it mentions 64 MP camara but it failed to impress me. When we click using front camara it takes 2-3 seconds hold time before clicking  the picture. No flash for front camara.During operation  I didn't  find phone to be user friendlyThe most disappointing thing is time it takes for charging. They claim that it is super fast charging  but it is even slower than my note 5 pro. In 1 hr it charges something  around  25-30%......Design- Not at all attractive.. Doesn't  feel like new phone.Not at all recommend.  You may go go for Mi for realme.. I trusted Samsung  but eventually  it didn't  fulfilled  my expectations.,-0.574,negative
  Very bad mobile. Heating and hanging problem. Amazon not refunding even having mobile problem. Don't buy this mobile. Go for Redmi mobile. Camera  quality is  worst. Many thing's not  supported. Anyone want to take this mobile please let me know. Reduce some amount. Buy before 7 days. Only  battery is good other is worst. Samsung  must quit in making mobile.,-0.9284,negative

"  First... I would like to express my experience of this mobile is tooooooo worst.... It's never performed like 6GB Ram Mobile.... It's working like 512kb ram ram mobile. And another great backdrop is it's bluetooth... It's connectivity does not meets at atleast basic phone... And another thing is it's speaker...This one also very poor.... Batter charging and backup also we can't compare with another brands in the present market... Because its took worst...I already requested to Amazon for return this phone, but, they smoothly refuesed my request as there is no chance to return as per their terms.Finally, my dear all who want to buy this product i strongly recommend that don't buy this mobile and don't waste your money...",0.8942,positive

"  Lets get straight to the ponit. If your main motive is to play graphic intensive games (pubg/cod/asphalt/etc.) then there is a back button for you on the top left. Though Samsung M31 is a very good phone, there are other phones in this price range which will just do better in gaming.But...Also read the rest• PERFORMANCEThe combination of M31 processor (Exynos9611) and it's operating system (One UI 2.0) will give you a level of performace where you'd think your device is a flagship phone. It is clean, fast, optimize, and just feels so premium in daily uses.• DISPLAYThe super Amoled display use in M31 and the display that Samsung used in thier flagship phones are same. It is just so eye pleasing and the colour production they are just amazing. You will not find any display equal to this in this price range.(If you dont mind the high refresh rate displays which does not have Amoled like M31)• BATTERY AND CHARGINGThe M31 got the highest amount of battery among all the phones that I've heard (including midrange and flagships). On many online reviews it's charging speed has been criticized by many reviewers. But after using it for a while I think they are kinda exaggerating. Because we barely let our phone battery die till we charge. In normal uses I charge when it is around 20-30% it gets fully charged within a hour and 45 minutes. Which is still surprisingly good considering the Battery size that we get.•CAMERACamera is the field in which the M31 shines amongst the other midrange competitors. The 64mp primary camera, the 8mp ultra wide, the 5mp depth sensor and the 5mp macro lens gives the perfect combination for the monster phone. Don't get fooled by the numbers in mega pixels because in the end it is how the device processes the pictures that matters the most. The Samsung M31 have particularly nailed those image processing.Meanwhile, the videos captured by these cameras are still above average they are not the best in this price range.*CONCLUSION*The Samsung M31 is one of the most overall balance phone in the midrange. In some devices when there is an upgrade in one field we needed to compromise with the other downgrade. Every phones have their pros and cons no matter what brand. But considering all these ups and downs M31 still makes a value for money purchase.Thank you..(If you have any question regardingthis device. You can always drop them on the comment)",0.9051,positive
"  Update 1:- AI scene detection really enhances the colours and over all camera is quite commendable according to the price, if comparing to my OnePlus 7T. I also got a case from Amazon at just ₹59 which was unbelievable. Attaching Pictures for reference. Will update in near future if found anything worth updating.------------------------------------------------------Great Specs. Great Value. I got the 128 GB variant. Only single Con is that the Back Panel Scratches Very Easily. After unboxing the phone and using it for an hour or so I could see some minute scratches, so i would recommend to get a skin. Also if you're thinking there are no cases available in the market right now as this is a new product. It might take some time due to the outbreak of Coronavirus. Therefore I have applied a transparent skin.Also another thing the length of the charging cable is too short in my opinion.",0.921,positive

Its battery performance  is very bad and it's taking more than 4-5 hrs to charginga and its getting complete in less than 1day eventhough we don't use much videos or games. Heating issue also there. Moreover,  I asked for replacement within 10 days itself but Amazon is keeping one useless mediating activity called phone inspection.  They will send some person who is not having any basic knowledge on phone or software and he do some nonsense. Technician means they should be professional  and they should carry some tools to test the phone. But nothing he iwas having. He simply reset my phone and starting checking charging properly or not. Means we should everytime reset our phone and charge and again have to reinstall or what. Very bad service by Amazon and the products they are selling are defective  pieces.

"  (After 2 months usage)The only advantage is AMOLED display.Performance of this phone is not at par.Battery is also disappointing as far as 6000 MAH is given, it only last a whole day.I was using 3500 mah phone earlier and that almost lasted same. Than 6000 mah should last too much longer than that, it's not optimised.Phone also gets heated sometimes even in normal usage (no games)Also build of the quality is not as standard for this range.

"  hi,I purchased this phone few days back. So far I am quite happy with the battery life. I had both JIO connections on VOLTE-ON and no WIFI, so on Mobile DATA this phone performs too good. Approx 20 hrs of usage on mobile data, 8 hrs ON in a corner where JIO signal is low. works like a charm.On WIFI, it says 100 even after 5 hrs with a usage of about 20+ min. this is also good.Definitely, Samsung bloatware apps, that you cant uninstall.However, I dont like the UI/Launcher. One of the worst looking icons. I hope samsung is reading this. 3 stars for this.Some MISSING features for this price and as everyone else is providing.1. LED Flash for missed messages/cals, etc2. LED flash for incoming calls3. Reminders & Goals missing in Calendar4. All the Apps are Samsung proprietary. Contacts, Calls, Messages, Calendar, etc5.

A great 64MP camera that takes great shots.. The wide angle is just amazing compared to any competitors in the price segment..

"  I was really excited for this phone. Ordered on the 5th of march and got it on the 6th. So far loved it and here's my review.My first impression was the weight being so good for a 6000mah battery phone. Also the display is excellent and every movie buff will love this. It also has Dolby Atmos sound.The rear camera is phenomenal (see pics). Getting a 64 MP camera inThe AI is what makes it stand out and the colours really pop out beautifully. The selfie camera (32 MP) is also good it doesnt have a flash but the screen flash does the job.Played pes (1.6 GB football multiplayer game) on it and it works very well. I haven't faced any lags in it so far. And the samsung UI like the notification bar, icons and settings is also easy to use and gives a premium effect.So here are the pros and consPROS:- Price- Camera- Battery- Display- Storage and it also has a dedicated memory card slot.CONS:- Back design could have been better. But i use a separate cover so it doesn't make difference to me.- Charging could be fasterFinal thoughts- This phone is ideal for anyone looking for a good battery and camera in their phone. The price still astounds me and samsung has really outdone itself.",0.9936,positive
"  I bought this phone as soon as it was launched, a month ago after my Galaxy S10 was stolen. I needed another phone but couldn't afford to get another expensive device after just losing one. When I read the specs for the M31 128GB (which seemed unreal) I decided to give it a shot. For the price, it's honestly a steal! Great battery life, awesome camera and pretty good aesthetic appeal too.What of course I'm disappointed in is that I've needed to reboot it several times due to the phone hanging or app failures and a couple of times it just rebooted on its own... The response is jerky at times (nothing in the league of the S series). But then, at this price, that's really not a fair comparison.So if you're looking for a monster that's pocket friendly - this is the BAAP. I would have just liked it slightly smaller in size so it fit pockets and arm bands easily... But that's me.",0.9681,positive
"  Out of all phones under 15k, it has the lowest SAR value (radiation levels).Now a days most of the marketing strategy is around adding RAM, Storage and Camera.

"  Samsung has created enough hype, got in many stars and YouTube reviewers to sing loud praises of this product. There is enough positive data out there, so I will not repeat that.This is undoubtedly one of the best mid-rangers out there. But with few glaring shortcomings. From minor to major flaws:First thing to note is the back panel, which is prone to scratches and smudges. Samsung could have provided a case or have made arrangements to ship both the device and some selection of cases together. I didn't see many. This phone needs a case. period.Second is the camera. while it is good, with heavy post processing to get the right results. You can reproduce some of the advertised samples with the help of a tripod. But day-to-day shots will be still at 80% mark. No complaints for the price paid though.Third and one of the worst offenders no one ever spoke of is the phone antenna. I have never seen a samsung with such pathetic antenna. Pair that with poor software. Signal is always 33% more attenuated compared to other phones: I have an older Nokia 8: M31 always has 2 bars less signal strength at the same place with same operator. Slips to 2G very easily. Calls are frequently cracking due to bad signal reception. And the software keeps forgetting my preferred network mode: Airtel on LTE auto and BSNL on 3G only. The moment I exit the setting app, it resets everything to LTE auto and the auto downgrade to 2G continues.If you work or live in a place with even 50% signal on your current phones, be warned that this phone will add to your woes by simply not connecting. Antenna design is not something new that had to be completely reinvented for this phone, nor does it involve very expensive materials. Yet Samsung has screwed up in one primary function: How will you watch FHD+ videos if signal and speeds are pathetic because someone screwed up a basic function?",-0.9764,negative

Released in March 2020  (Felt latest model)3.  Specs are good enough for budget price of 17k.4,  Cam specs4.  Not to a pick a Chinese product.But friends i am telling you who are having above thoughts you make like M31 but dont go for it. Because here are con's :1. While speaking over the phone, Its going to hold even though there is no touch to screen while speaking.2. Even though i haven't enabled call recording, few calls are getting recorded automatically.3. Worst thing, If you upload a pick to Watsapp status your picture quality goes worst.4. For full charging it will take 3 hours. Not used my phone extensively it gave charging for 1.5 day.5. Vedio recording image stabilization - Worst.Then i started googling about unstability of this phone, There was an update for samsung M31 in April which made phone to unstable.

"  I have been using the phone for the past 2 month now. The battery life is a sham!! 6000mah does not even last for a day and the phone becomes very hot very easily, and the calls disconnect or the phone restarts at its will. The WiFi calling does not work at least 40% of the time!! It is filled with a ton of benefits but the main reason anyone would ever buy this phone is for the battery and that is not true as advertised. One WiFi video call of 2 hours drains at-least 40% of the battery!! My battery stays for only one day, I got better battery life with my old phone of 5000mah...could do almost 48 hours without any charge. Now I'm stuck with this!! Please test the battery and return it immediately if there is a fault, don't do what I did, which is 'I adjusted'!",0.4016,positive

"  Purchased this phone on the 1st day of launch i.e. 5th March 2020; 12:00 PM. After using more than a week, reviewing the phone on 14th March 2020; 5:15 PM. I hope you will find it helpful.*Camera:Rear Camera has few mode/frames. Out of which it's fixed 3:4 (64 mp) has great picture quality. Other modes/frame like 3:4, 9:16, 1:1, full can capture good quality pics as long as you do not zoom it. Video quality is also good but could be better.Front camera 32 mp is also fine. You will get delicately balanced picture quality.* 6.4 inches phone feels bit large and heavy while handling and keeping in pockets.* Battery (6000mAH): It stood on its ground. Surely have high battery backup. Did few experiments and here's the result:--> Around 50 hrs on standby mode with normal use for calling and checking messages (Wifi was active during those hours and background apps were running)--> 11-12 hrs of continuous usage for gaming--> 18-20 hrs of continuous video playing over wifi (not sure for mobile network)Disclaimer: These hours may vary as per individual use and environment. I'm sharing the details as per my own usage.* Exynos 9611 Octa core processor: Samsung is surely working hard with providing improved versions of its processor. The processor speed with the combination of Android v10 is great. I didn't find any heating issue even while playing high end graphic games. The RAM wasn't even getting used completely. However, if we compare this processor with Snapdragon, I can say that this processor is equivalent to Snapdragon 700 series.* Face unlock and fingerprint sensor: Company claims that the phone has fast face unlock and fingerprint sensor. However, I didn't find that true. For face unlock, the phone takes 2-3 sec time to detect the face.* Phone comes with Dual SIM (nano+nano) facility but with dual standby. Both SIMs aren't active simultaneously.* Both Charging slot and 3.5mm jack for earphones are placed at same end (bottom side), which I personally didn't like (That is one of the reason I rate it 4 star).* There are other internal features as well which one person might like and another might not. Example: Wifi Calling support, Blue light filter, smart view, ultra data saving mode, Dulby Atmos, Dark Mode etc...--> Dulby Atmos function work while you plug in the ear-phones (I personally didn't find it that good. Sound quality seems similar)--> Personally love the Dark Mode.Overall, the Smartphone is great. If you want to purchase a smartphone within this range, you may go ahead with this one.",0.996,positive

"  This is the Galaxy M31 review after a week use.Bought this phone to replace my existing iPhone SE after watching so many videos of tech reviews which are continuously bashing Apple for providing low specs mobiles. After a week, I realised that I made severe mistake by acknowledging their words. The 64 MP camera is nowhere near my 4 year old iPhone’s 12 MP camera. Macro camera is another joke in this package.Performance:  Galaxy M31 has ‘so called’ 6 GB RAM but works like 100MB RAM device. 3 GB RAM will always be occupied and you can’t do anything about that. Say what, you are free to use 3 GB RAM only. Even my Windows 10 OS use only 1.5 GB RAM. And even my older Moto E ( yes, Moto E) works better than this phone in scrolling through internet. About gaming, it’s bad joke. My 4 years old iPhone SE runs seamlessly even in 2GB RAM.Tech people always boast about Android that it’s customisable. What customisation would serve if your phone is not even working properly? You aren’t even allowed to uninstall Netflix and they keep talking about customisations.Battery life is pretty good though. At least they did good in this case. 6000mAh lives for 1.5 to 2 days in normal use.Another feature provided with this phone is heating. Just some normal activities will heat up your Galaxy M31 so much that you can pretty much use it as heater in winters. Not joking here.I bought 64 GB variant, and only 47 GB was usable. Android system is taking 13-14 GB in the system. Really?Overall, not happy with purchase. Waste of 16.5K with this garbage product.Samsung, you can so way better than this!!",0.9764,positive
"  From the user of Samsung Guru 1200, Metro duos C3322, Mertro XL, Galaxy On5 Pro to this Galaxy M31 & going to use Note series after some months & as a Samsung fan I'm honestly writing this review. This is a Decent phone at this price. Most of the time the Fingerprint reader unable to unlock the phone. This type of camera quality isn't expected from 64MP, f1.8 camera sensor. Macro camera, selfie camera, wide angle camera okay. In this phone, you can't choose ringtone from external memory or even phone memory and Samsung should give the internet speed notification, daily usage on the notification bar like other mobile phone to compete in this type of small matter, without giving that Glance, Discover etc option. Samsung should change this from next update to become more popular like other phone. Touchscreen is too much sensitive but this sAMOLED screen is just superb, awesome and 6000mAh battery will give you a long lasting usage after one full charge. Otherwise it's an all in one phone.The new problem which I'm facing now(after using it 2 months) is, if the data connection is on with 1st SIM and at that time if any SMS comes to 2nd SIM then the data connection get lost fully until I active the airplane mode & then deactivate it. It makes a lot of problem during banking transactions with OTPs.",0.9262,positive
  Very bad product. There are so many issue.1. Heating during using the phone. Like camera phone calls in 2-5 mins.2. Poor front camera quality. Like 8 MP camera.3. Sound is also not good.4. Taking more than 3 hours to charge full. And 6000mah batter is giving one day backup.full fake.Totally fake phone by Samsung. Requesting Amazon to don't sell this kind of fake phone.

"  As consider price point galaxy m31 is very high in price because of the performance, camera quality, processor and design wise its very dull and boring in real life and also heatup very quickly when Playing games. And one more thing in galaxy m31 also have ads like redmi, realme, oppo and vivo. Samsung simply cheat you and looting you.I must said please don't waste your money on waste galaxy m31 because at this price you have very better option available in market.

If the result come positive they say the phone cannot be returned and we need to talk to the manufacturers.Total waste of money.. now that I have to live with this noise less phone until i get another one.And another point to note is that, I trusted that I would be happy with this phone, hence had purchased a special phone cover. now that money is also a waste.",0.9253,positive

"  The phone looks and feels good in the hand. All the gimmicks while setting up the phone would make one feel happy about buying the phone. Now let's get to the tall claims by Samsung basis which one has spent 17K.First of all I received a phone which when switched on went directly to system reboot mode. That was the first shock! The others are described next.Finger print reader is slow at times and one has to place the finger a couple of times to unlock the phone.Battery Life is lower than a 3000mah. Yes, one would get a longer battery life out of this phone if left unused and that is precisely what it hasn't been purchased for.Camera Quality is bad, very bad. The pictures are so grainy and pixelated. Had a Moto G4 plus before this and the picture quality from the camera was awesome.Feel cheated by Samsung for palming off such poor quality device for INR 17K. I want a refund.Amazon, I am aware that this review will go through a review by your team. Please take note and help initiate a return and refund so that I can buy a better device worth its value.

  Awesome  screen .Awesome battery  .Awesome  cameras .Specially  ... one UI 2.0 of Samsung  is superb. I used Samsung  Galaxy  alot but for 2-3yrs i was on moto and others ... but being  back to Samsung ... it's  worth it .Go for it ... the screen is just min blowing  at this price . No one can beat it .Also .. I don't  play any games ... but i read alot and watch plenty of movies ...but being  an experienced  smartphone  user i can tell ... it can run any game without  lag .. with 6 gb + exynos 9611 processors (if I'm  ri8) . Same as A51 which cost 24k .Just go for it .1 thing is plastic body ... but body is also very good ... not like previous  plastic  Samsung  ... it's  glossy ... but any way we are gonna use back case  ... so it doesn't matter  anyway .1 thing - Biometric  take some time to get use to i guess.It's  a large device ... side fingerprint  would have been best .And face unlock  take some time ..... face unlock is not that good i would say . But may be due to extra security  .. we have to make sure of correct  angle and light  .,0.9618,positive
"  I used to be a Samsung customer long back but had switched to Chinese brands which have dominated the market for quite some time now. It is very refreshing to see Samsung again giving competition to these brands in 15-20k segment.This phone is certainly a testimony to the resurgence of Samsung in this price bracket.Now coming to the phone :Pros :-1. Battery : This has to be the single largest plus point of this phone. At 6000mah, Its battery is a monster and it was the prime reason i bought this model rather than the other chinese brands which barely last a day on a full recharge. On the other hand, this battery easily lasts 1.5 - 2 days in normal usage and more than a day in heavy usage.2. Dedicated memory slot (2+1) : This is another big plus of this model that you get a dedicated slot for memory card.3. Screen Quality - It is FHD+ screen with nice and smooth colors. There is no lag and it feels fluidic. Where it scores over other brands is that Samsung offers Super Amoled screen whereas other brands have LCD capacitive touch screen. Though there is not a huge difference between the two but you do get a premium feel while using this one.4. Camera - Again it is good at 64mp and the zoom out feature works like a charm. Also, there is no lag whatsoever while clicking heavy pics at full resolution. Front facing camera is good as well and stands at 32mp. No lag in clicking front photos as well.5. Size : It is not that huge and you can use it with a single hand.6. Memory : 6gb Ram and 128 gb memory is more than sufficient. Plus, the dedicated memory slot is a huge add-on.Other conviniences include - Type C charging port and fast charging support and 3.5mm audio jack.Now coming to the cons. Not many but a couple i definitely noticed :1. Fingerprint Sensor : It is not just bad but very bad (and I mean it). Very unresponsive and erratic. I mean you have to wait for a couple of seconds for it to respond after placing your finger. And it may sometimes glitch as well. So, you need to retry.2. Charging cable : Extremely short length at 1 feet or so which renders it quite useless. Length is very insufficient.3. Charger : It is a standard 5v-2A charger. They could have provides a bigger one given that phone supports quick charging.Overall if you take a look at the price (15k) , it is an awesome buy. Apart from the Fingerprint sensor, I found everything in the phone to be top-notch. The specs at this price might be arguably comparable to other phones in this range but the battery backup makes buying this phone a no-brainer. Would definitely recommend this anytime :)",0.9977,positive

"  I was using Samsung J2 earlier,  excellent phone,  later shifted to moto X4....after long time switching again to Samsung after hearing the success of M30s. Little disappointed.

If we use this mobile without back cover,  please will judge that this guy is using cheap Mobile,  I am covering it up with spigen cover now. It is not even like Samsung J2 mobile. Poor plastic.(ABS).2. CAMERA,  I use to take lot of mobile photographs  it's my hobby,  I don't see any difference in this megapixel and 3 or 4 camera's....if you are better cameraman, single camera is enough,  since it is with 4 camera we try to take different pictures,  camera okay. Lot of night in low light. Macro is 5 MP, no clear picture....3. Reception of Mobil signal, I felt slightly weak,  when I compare with motoX4, I was using it for nearly 2 years, now with M31s, I am not getting proper data connectivity inside home. Further I have to check...4. Mobile phone is mobile slightly heating up, not like mi,  but it is not like earlier Samsung.5. Battery it mega but last for one complete day, there is ko need to search charger in the evening,  but we need to charge it in the night, the charging time is long since the battery 6000mah.

  So this is my edit review after using not more than 3months.. It has discolouration issue.. No any external force applied neither contact of water.. It happend when my phone's battery death and I plugged in with charger after then I putted off and I saw discolouration sudden..It started right bottom to top with pink and purple shade nd quickly spread overall display..And when I visited service center they directly denied to repair as told that it's not under in warranty.... Nd I'll have to bear that cost with Rs of 5000 to 6000 for change the display.. When I already spent 17000 Rs. to purchased new phone..DISGUSTING....And I believe that everyone keep their phone safely when atleast phone is new and expensive..I feel just regret about my decision and mistake I made to purchased this worst compny phone..But I surprised how Samsung play the scam game with their valuable customersNow I believe that Samsung is just fraud and fake and it's scam nd make fool to their customers in name of the warranty.I recommend to all Amazon buddies pls pls pls 🙏 don't go with Samsung Phone if you don't wanna waste your hard earn and valuable money....,-0.9497,negative

"   The Amazon tamper proof packaging & timely delivery is always worth a thumbs up.The product was delivered without any issue, but after unboxing, when I wanted to switch it on, it just wouldn't. I was expecting the phone to have some juice, at least 20-30% battery, but it was not so. When I connected it to the charger, the battery level was 0%. So I charged to 20% and then switched it on..and it actually started in the recovery mode, instead of normal boot. And that was a surprise..but then I could boot it normally.After this initial scare, the setup was normal and smooth.I like the look & feel of the product, and as compared to my earlier Moto One Power, it is way lighter even with a 6000 mah battery. But I do have a feeling, Snapdragon is a bit smoother than Exynos.Overall for me, after two days of usage, I am satisfied with the performance. The camera output, both front & rear, are really good, though I have not used all the modes yet.For me, the most useful features are the in-built call recording facility and the always on feature (I though always on was only available with Motorola).In short, I would say, it is a value for money device.I purchased the phone in March 2020, and by end of July 2020, I have received 2 security and feature updates.I have used the camera in the last 5 months.

The ocean blue colour makes a premium feel in hand.6. Battery life is quite very good.7. The expandable storage through micro sd is quite appreciable.8. The processor is fast and good for gaming.9. It competes with other samsung phones and is a good replacement for J series in terms of features, speed, processor and ram.Cons: 1. No back cover and earphones are provided by samsung with this phone which isn’t expected. Though all the lower range phones of other brands have these basic things.2. The back panel is polymide plastic which could have been a glass one to give it a premium feel like in Redmi note 8 Pro which too has almost the same price tag.3. The face unlock does not always recognise the face and have to work with fingerprint or other methods of unlock.4. The display seems to be fragile and prone to scratches and cracks if hybrid case and tampered is not used.5. The charging is a bit slow.6. The phone lags sometimes while unlocking through lock screen which isn’t expected with this processor and android version.7. The sound output could have been more.8. The fingerprint sensor is located too above on the back panel.9. The camera quality is average and could have been much better as compared to other brands with this price.The phone could have been a beast if these features were improved by samsung. I will conclude by saying, Its a very good phone in this price tag if these cons does not matter your day to day usage. Though its the best phone in all the lower range series of samsung.",0.9516,positive
"  The WORST phone you can get in this range, front camera pics quality is so worst that it looks like an oil paint job with all smudged, NO SHARPNESS at all. The curve of display is so round it doesn't even  feel like a rounded rectangle, it's an OVAL. EVERTHING IS PLASTIC, The software processing, image processing, performance processing  is just bad, no its WORST. The game booster which is provided doesn't  seems like its boosting anything than consumption of battery. A LOT OF HEAT IS GENERATED in usage of 1 hour even while doing normal tasks.In conclusion, even if someone  is giving  this SAMSUNG M31 for free DON'T BUY IT.  M31 is just a hoax of a specs and nothing more, the worst of all. This was my first samsung phone, gone with the brand's name and it's simply disappointing,NEVER GONNA BUY ANOTHER  SAMSUNG PRODUCTNow with this AMAZON POLICY OF NOT REFUNDING, feels like the most regrettable decision of the year, feels like mental torture spending 17K for this M31. SIMPLY WORST. Seriously  need my money back, NEED REFUND for this product, WORST PRODUCT in every aspect.",-0.9738,negative
"  UPDATE: I hate this phone... how can a phone just crash and reboot lying on the table without being used? This *NEVER* happened with my Motorola G5 Plus!======================================================================================Looks surprisingly thin. But not great. Samsung UI is ok, but not great. Lots of bloatware.. some I could uninstall, but some I couldn't. Installed Microsoft Launcher over the Samsung UI.Took some photos.. it didn't stand out. Though I need to take more photos to judge.The one thing which I absolutely HATE is the position of the single speaker.... it's just where I usually place my right pinky finger to hold up the phone. And this drowns out the sound of the video. It's very important to buy a phone with dual speakers.. preferably one that is at the top.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------Updated after more than a month of usage:- The phone heats up during charging.- It has crashed and rebooted 2-3 times while in the middle of something.- Low light videos are TERRIBLE.- Compass calibration keeps going wrong. Every time I have to use it, I need to re-calibrate it.- Speaker is not good at all. Part of the reason is the placement. My 3 year old Moto G5 Plus was much better.I wish I had bought the Redmi Note 9 Pro :(",-0.9915,negative

"  Do not buy this phone.Its display quality is very bad. My one month old Galaxy M31 phone developed crack in display. It does not have any physical damage from outside. Now Samsung service center is taking Rs. 5000 to repair it. Just one month back I have purchased it and it is under warranty, but they are charging money to repair it.Today I called Samsung Service Center, but nobody is picking up phone. More than 10 days have passed, they have taken my phone but no status update from them.Just now (21 Sept 2020) I received a call from Samsung, they informed me that spare parts is not available for this M31 model, so they will refund (coupon) me the purchase price by deducting Rs.5200 for the defective display.My question to Amazon and Samsung is that how you can tell that replacement spare is not available for this newly lunched phone? Just 2 months back this phone was launched.So, requesting Amazon and Samsung to refund full purchase price of the phone and also compensesation. No coupon will be accepted, transfer in my bank account.When you are selling any products, you are bound to provide spare part support upto it's end-of-life/support date. Did you mean EOL/EOS reached in just 2 months?",-0.5278,negative

"  Before buying this phone, I had some doubt but after using this for almost one month, I am 💯 percent sure to say that, Samsung mid range phones are shit,Front camera quality is as bad as VGA one,Rear camera: always struggles to focus on close clicks, this phone has 64 MP camera but even my 16 MP phone camera perform far better, I can share the pics for comparison,Battery: this phone comes with 6000 battery but works as 4500 battery back up, maximum 12 hours, and the slow charging add more dimerit to it,Display: good,Performance: bad, very very bad, I don't know if my phone has some problem or Samsung is just proving it's  legacy of bad performaing mid range phones, this phone starts lagging while opening very normal apps, like WhatsApp, and YouTube, in have to say that m31 is  1.5 second slow in opening any app in comparison with my 4 GB RAM  cell phone.Design: does not feel sleek and premium in hand due to plastic body, but we could take that bulky design if battery works as expected because it has 6000 mah battery in it, but battery performance of this phone is simply bad.Sorry Samsung for this critical and negative review, but I have to say that you need to work on your midrange phones as well,",-0.9696,negative

"  I ordered this phone and received on time. Thanks to Amazon. But once I opened the packet, the box was sealed, but the phone looked to be used already like may be for 1-2 days. There was a little scratch on the side of the phone, many applications weren’t working properly on the phone (ex: YouTube, Spotify), but eventually YouTube was fine but Spotify still has problem. I thought it to be problem of software, I reset the phone but nothing helped. Amid lockdown, I made peace with the phone but the just on the second day I was having problem with phone like my voice to the other person on calls was distorted and the other time the other person’s voice to me was distorted. I called amazon, twice thrice, but they suggested to diagnose the problem through their so called smart check application and my bad luck, and it didn’t show any problem. And for scratches, the amazon guys asked me to send photos but I don’t have DSLR to capture those small scratches (poor me). I ended up being denied for replacement or refund for the phone.I feel I am cheated on this particular product, I have invested rs. 15999 for a not reliable phone in my hand. It may stop working any time.Poor experience with amazon as well as the Samsung galaxy m31.I don’t even want to keep this phone, It gave me that bad experience in just 2 days of using it.

First they ask you to download a stupid app to run testing which takes incorrect tests. I have problem with my touchscreen & they test the fingerprint sensor & give a result stating that all is good. Secondly I cannot contact any customer care agent as no one is available at this point of time. Customers are left to fend for themselves. ""Atmanirbhar"" is taken to a whole new level by Amazon!!! Utterly DisgustingPlease sort this out Amazon before your customers shift to other online apps.Samsung, Where has your quality gone? Do you only focus on expensive phones? One Plus & other brands have already started eating up your market share.. please act wisely if you don't want to share your fate with Nokia.",-0.8376,negative

Touch is better than other mobiles compared to Oppo or MIComing to negative pointsall reviews almost fake regarding battery...they just really bluffed..6000 mah battery is not even coming for 2 full days..I used data for around 18 hrs but still it got drained fast.When charged the mobile it taking around 4 hrs to get complete charge from 0 to 100 percentage  but mobile is getting heated a lot..didn't expect this from Samsung at all.Loud speaker is not so efficient.Normal sound is goodAs its SAMOLED the picture or video quality is good..eyes r not strained,-0.1196,negative
"  I have used Redmi mobiles for the past 3 years. I just wanted to change to Samsung for a change of experience. And you know what, it's turned out to be a good decision. Samsung Galaxy is an absolute beast. It looks elegant and operates smoothly with quite a lot of good quality features. I am enjoying using this mobile.Pros:* camera: video and image quality and available modes are too good at this price. It's good to have a 64MP camera. It works well in night light also.* Battery life is good.* No heating issues found while using and charging, unlike redmi mobiles.* No need of unnecessary mandatory apps installation like in redmi.* I feel like this mobiles  GUI is amazing and better than Redmi mobiles GUI (maybe because I got bored using redmi mobiles??).* Dolby sound system is too good. You can feel the difference if you compare audio quality with other mobile phones audio.* Smart switch app from Samsung helps to copy all the data from your previous mobile to this one. It's a good feature.* This mobile operates so smoothly.*Amoled display is amazing.Cons:* Face unlock system sometimes fails in darkness. Samsung should have worked on this feature pre-release. But it works fine in daylight.Overall a good experience and recommended product.Just a suggestion, if you are buying this mobile please spend 500 more bucks and buy Spigen back cover, mobile looks elegant with it. You will love your mobile more. Dont go for cheap quality back covers. You will regret it later.Update: After using it for 1 month, I have found that the internet speed is bit low when compared to other mobiles and sometimes internet disconnects automatically for some seconds.",0.9853,positive

The camera quality is good, ease of using, navigation is extremely user friendly and the  finger print sensor is good, not yet explored face recognition feature. Most of the important apps are pre-installed hence its again a plus point and more importantly Microsoft tools are re pre-installed, Just one draw back which I  found in the phone as of now is the app lock facility is not available need to install a separate app from the play store, this should have given as a preinstalled feature.My verdict is go for the phone its an awesome piece not from china so that's another satisfaction of holding this handset.",0.9893,positive

It does not even last for a single day with moderate usage i.e. surfing with wifi connectivity (no gaming or watching videos).3. 64 mega pixel camera is another gimmick. No detailing is there.

"  Feedback:I Ordered Samsung Galaxy M31 within 1 minutes after-sale starts. This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag. I'm writing after a few days of usage and Again I re-order from this same model same colour and same configuration. price range very attractive and all requirement full fill. Really impressed by the quality of the camera. All 4 back cameras are working great. Wide-angle feature is great. Live focus, Macro and Slow-motion features are awesome. Front camera is very good. I may not require to carry my DSLR everywhere.Delivery was fast, packing was good,I share my experience with my friend they also buy this same product and also happy.Good:- Wi-Fi Calling Facility is to good.- The display is excellent with Blue light filter.- The performance is good. No heating or lagging.

"  I recently purchased an M21 for my father and was more than happy with its overall performance, be it the camera, battery or software performance. Hence, decided to upgrade my mother's phone as well and Samsung M series being Proudly Made in India and a non Chinese but a Korean brand, ordered the M31 128GB.To my surprise, I was even more amazed when the phone arrived. Everything the M21 was best at, was carried over and the Camera performance was even more improved in every aspect.The sharpness, AF, colours, and also video performance was improved over M21 which itself is good.No wonder the phone is selling like hot cakes all over India. My only regret now is, I didnt knew the M31s was launching. Else I would have waited for the M31s which going by the reviews, is a monster in Camera segment.Anyway, since my moms and dads phones have been set and purchased already, I think I need a phone upgrade for myself and it sure will be a Samsung. Probably the upcoming A71S 5G or an A51s 5G since i have read up about the about to be released Samsung phones.",0.9826,positive

Dolby Atmos SupportCons:1. Exynos 9611 is fair enough to handle the daily work but it's a little old processor, it would be better if it would come with any of the latest ones.2. Fingerprint sensor is adequately fast but it's a capacitive and back mounted. It would be better if it would have in display one.3. The phone has a massive 6000 mAh battery and it supports fast charging only upto 15 watt. It would be better if would support 25 watt because it takes quite a time to charge the battery fully.N.B.

"  Updates after couple of weeks of usage!!‐----‐--‐---------‐-----Stay away from this! Biometrics is a joke! Never ever again will choose a Samsung product for mobile!Updates after couple of days usage...1. Battery power seems to be good!2. Fast charging is a let down!3. Finger print sensor doesn't work most of the times and required constant cleaning!! I would rather use face lock!!4. Memory (6GB) is not performing well. Recommend to go for 8GB.=====================================With lot of excitement, i bought this phone and to my disappointment it is an utter flop! Phone heated up like anything which i was setting it up and I could immediately feel that the phone had problems. May be for 16K this is what you get?? But might disappointed as I have used other low cost phones and have never faced such problems. Now, I thought Samsung as a brand was good, but I realized that it is not about the brand name always.

"  I purchased Samsung NEW on the very day of its launch. Got delivery next day. Actually it arrived before estimated time.This I have been using the phone for about one week now. It's a fantastic phone.1. Design, slimness, weight is very impressive.2. Display sAMOLED is simply superb. Color production stunning.3. I have purchased M30s also a few months ago. M31's display is even better than M30s.4. Battery lasts for about 2 days on usual use time. I have Samsung On Max also. Which I have to charge twice a day. But NEW easily runs for 2 days.5. Camera is also very good, both rear and front. I have taken some night photos without using flash. They, beautifully captured the subjects with clear details. Front camera is equally good.6. It's lighter than M30s (which is also having 6000mah battery).7. Phone doesn't get heated up much even on continuous use.8. One good feature Samsung has added is caller identity. It detects spams automatically. No need to install Truecaller.9. It also has QR Code scanner. This is very helpful.Overall it's a fantastic phone at this price range. I am fully satisfied having purchased this phone10. Night mode photos are stunning. The first photo given above is of Hyderabad nightline, taken from my balcony.11. Next two photos are of clouds taken from an Indigo flight.12. Next snap is of cardamom flowers in my garden.13. The last one is pav baked by me at home. Snap taken with Food Mode.

  Phones battery life is good but it gets heated for example when you are on call for a long time for while booking cabs when location is on it takes a lot of battery No pop up notifications in WhatsApp phone needs work in accessibility I am a low vision person the phones keyboard gets too much expanded when using zoom gesture making it impossible to type I have to reboot the whole phone to get the keyboard to its normal size . Select to speak options hangs frequently and the phone becomes unaccessible.after my purchase there was a software update due to which my screen gets zoom automatically creating problem while using which is very irritating face recognition is not that good phone takes two and a half hour to charge completely.Camera is really nice beautiful pictures come out.,0.1552,positive
  Not worth it when you compare it with Xiaomi phonesIssues--Heavier than MI phones--Screenshot is not by scrolling  3 fingers as in MI phones.

"  Good phone in mid range. Though the plastic back takes away the premium feel of using samsung brand. Function wise it's good.

Keeps you going all day!Camera quality is awesome and comes with many cool features also! Pictures and videos are sharp and true to their color and high quality.Overall, it comes with many features and the brand Samsung adds to the value and trustworthiness of this phone!! Using it for three months now. Smooth and perfect.PA: no proper cover available. I wish samsung provided it.even if for extra cost with high quality for protection.Couldn't find any till date. Help me if someone has recommendations.:(",0.9919,positive
"  Let’s start with the first strong point of the Samsung Galaxy M31, the design. The phone is quite lightweight in spite of sporting a huge 6,000mAh battery. The phone is quite comfortable to hold in your hand, though the one-handed operation is not that great. The sides are slightly curved, which provides a good grip and the power button is each to reach. The phone is available in two colour options, Ocean Blue and Space Black. We got the latter for review and it sure looks premium, though it picks up fingerprints and smudges, so putting in a case is the best option.Another area where the Galaxy M31 does a good job is the display. The smartphone is loaded with a 6.4-inch Full HD+ Infinity U display with a screen resolution of 2400 x 1080 pixels. The display is protected with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection. The display delivers some good results as the colours were bright and text looked sharp in our testing. Furthermore, the phone supports Widevine L1 support, meaning that you can stream HD content on Netflix and Amazon Prime Videos.Samsung Galaxy M31: Camera ReviewThe Galaxy M31 offers you improved performance in terms of the cameras. The phone is loaded with a 64-megapixel main camera with f/1.8 aperture, an 8-megapixel wide-angle camera with f/2.2 aperture, a 5-megapixel depth camera with f/2.2 aperture, and 5-megapixel macro lens with f/2.4 aperture. For the front, there will be a 32-megapixel selfie camera with f/2.0 aperture.Galaxy M31That said, the camera performance is quite decent in the daylight conditions. The photos came out to be punchy and well-detailed. The phone does a good job in taking macro shots, though you need to get used to it. The wide-angle lens offers you a better field of view, though detailing goes for a toss in this mode. The selfie performance is decent as well, though you might find some oversaturation in the photos.In low light conditions, the Samsung Galaxy M31 does an average job. In our testing, we found out the photo taken in low light conditions shows loss of quality. The details are not that impressive in nature and you will notice lots of grains and noises in the image. The wide-angle mode in the low light also performs quite average in our opinion as the results were not at all impressive. The Night mode comes to the rescue and the photos came out to be slightly better using Night Mode in the camera, though it automatically zooms in up to 2x when you switch to this mode. This some times spoils the whole composition, which can be frustrating at times. Moving on, the Live Focus mode is not that amazing as the edge detection still needs some improvements.Samsung Galaxy M31: Battery and Security ReviewGalaxy M31The smartphone is loaded with a 6,000mAh battery with 15W fast charging support. The major highlight of the Galaxy M31 is the battery backup. In our testing, we found out that the phone delivers up to 2 days of battery backup under normal to mixed usage. Even if you do lots of gaming or stream content, the battery life will not disappoint you. Coming to the charging speeds, the smartphone takes up to 2 hours to get from 3 per cent to 100 per cent.Coming to the security, the phone is loaded with a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor along with face unlock feature. The fingerprint sensor works just fine and you will not face any trouble while unlocking the smartphone. Furthermore, the face unlock feature works good in well-lit conditions, though it shimmers a bit in low-light areas.Samsung Galaxy M31: Performance ReviewGalaxy M31The Samsung Galaxy M31 is powered by a Samsung Exynos 9611 processor. This is the same chipset, which is found in Galaxy A51. The chipset provides some good results in day-to-day scenarios and you will not face any kind of lag or shutter. When it comes to multi-tasking or pushing the phone, it shows some sign of lag. In the gaming section, one can play casual games like Subway Surfers, Johnny Triggers and more without any lag, however, when it comes to high-end games like PUBG Mobile or Asphalt series, the phone does a decent job as well. That said, you will notice that the phone warms up quite a bit during extended gaming sessions.On the software front, the Galaxy M31 runs on Android 10 with company’s custom user interface OneUI 2.0 running on top of it. The user interface is refined as compared to the previous versions and you get new Dark Mode, which is a good thing. Apart from this, you get gesture-based navigation controls along with Focus Mode, Digital Wellbeing and Parental Controls. Apart from this, you get some standard features like double-tap to wake, gesture-based screenshot and more. On the downside, you still see a lot of bloatware in the phone including Google and Microsoft app suites along with other apps like Netflix, Facebook, Samsung Max and more. My Galaxy application is one annoying app that keeps sending you to push notifications throughout the day.",0.9958,positive
  First time I plugged in for charging. Phone displayed recovery mode screen though I haven't pressed any button. Totally disappointed by this experience.I have requested to return this item and refund me entire amount but amazon policy relaxed upto replacement.Bad experience.Display and look wise phone looks stunning but still I haven't used it so system performance might be well as expected. I hope so.Waiting for brand new replacement of M31. I hope it would work well,0.9769,positive

"  Samsung Galaxy M31 gives you a very high value for the price. Given my price range and the features I was looking for, it was hands-down the best smartphone in the market right now.At this price range, Samsung offers a lot of features in this smartphone that the other brands have not. For example -  AMOLED SCREEN, An enormous 6000 mAh battery and also a 64-megapixel quad-camera!!!This phone makes watching movies a pleasure due to the AMOLED screen for immersive viewing experience and the Dolby Sound as a cherry on the cake.I also, do recommend this product for novice photographers.Conclusion: I am freaking loving this smartphone",0.9438,positive

"  Wonderful phone for this budget. People talk about lot of specs in the phones like xiaomi  and poco in this price range. But Samsung has all that and longevity as well. Samsung phones don't die on you.The camera setup on this phone is wonderful, the detailing it captures, the colors, the selfies  every thing is perfect.The huge 6000mah battery, just wow. It will easily last for 2 days if not more. Even with high youtubeing and social networking it will last for 2 days.Signal receiving strength is excellent and to add to that it has wifi-calling option as well.Speakers are good, but real deal is listening the music through head phones, it supports Dolby atmos.The rear mounted finger print sensor is at the right place and super fast.The 6.4 inch AMOLED screen is next level. Its Samsung so you can't expect nothing less.With 6 GB RAM the multi tasking is really good.Overall wonderful phone with very decent pricing and its Samsung.  It can't get any better than this in this price range.So go for it and this phone will definitely surprise you.",0.9959,positive

They will send some technician to check it and ""if "" he finds issue phone will be replaced.If I would have known this I would never have purchased it from here.Now only god knows how my problem will be solved.

It took 40 hours for the mobile battery to go from 100 % to 23 %. In this timeframe I had medium usage of the mobile also I used it with wats app live tracking with GPS on for my cycling trip for 8 hours. Also around 3 hours of Google map use.Though I cannot comment much on gaming experience as I don't play games on mobile, but just to experience played subway surfers for 10 minutes and it performed good.Overall a good buy for me as I was searching for a mobile with nice camera and battery.",0.934,positive
  An awesome product.Value for money.The battery is so much good that it is unbelievable. About battery I want to say something that please do charge the phone for the first time to 100% fully charge and then use the phone or else the battery life reduces.The camera quality is awesome. Just remember to apply correct settings.Front camera photos looks awesome.Phone performance is also very good. Very smooth controls and the screen quality is also very good.Sound quality is also up to the markThe phone has an excellent sensor coordination for everything.It also has a virtual proximity sensor and an AR support from Google with an excellent gyro sensor.The fingerprint sensor is also very fast.The face unlock feature is above everything.It detects face automatically when your phone is kept upright even without turning screen on. It will detect your face and automatically turn on.The look of the phone is also very nice with a glassy look on back.This is a power packed phone which will always win over any phone in this price range.I think everyone should try this experience.I trust Samsung and still I think it is better to buy a Samsung phone than to buy other phones even if they are offering some more features.I am very happy to write this review.I think this review you make impact a bit.Just stop here and buy this product.After using it you would be feel that your decision was right.Thank you for reading my review till last.,0.9923,positive

"  I have been using this phone for more than 2 weeks and the battery feels like 3000mAh at best.I have used 5000mAh phones from Asus and Panasonic before and those phone easily gave 1.5 to 2 days usage. With the advertised capacity and with a below average processor this should last longer.I am an average user mostly on WiFi and rarely uses mobile data. Very difficult to use it on second day without charging.Charges very slowly and discharges fast. It should have been the other way around.Performance is average. Try to stay away from Exynos processors if you want a reasonably fast phone. But I knew this before buying, so no complaints hereCamera seems decent, but I rarely takes photos and don't think I have enough knowledge to comment on the camera quality",0.6765,positive
"  I have been purchasing Samsung M series phones for self and family for years now and never regretted my choices. The M30s for my FiL and this lovely M31 for myself are both excellent phones at a very very competitive price. With the lastest Android 10 OS and access to both Google and Galaxy playstores, an incredible Amoled screen with excellent touch sensitivity etc., this is a beautiful choice. With a monster battery, even without aggressive conservation settings, you get good milage. The new USB connector is a joy, with the option of high power charging for those urgencies when traveling.. backed by Amazon's super logistics and accessories options, this is a great buy!",0.9889,positive
"  It is a best budget phone with the amount of provided specs in it, having a massive battery of 6000mah gave me a decent backup of upto 2 days, if you are a average user then this is a phone you want, I played all types of games in it from ludo to asphalt 9 and pubg but it stood up to its name as not much of battery drain but minute lags were observed at the start but later on after few second everything got ok, adaptive brightness is very good but was not working some times had to manually set it but sometimes switching it off and on came as a solution, fingerprint sensor is quick but some times doesn't works if it is a bit dusty, also if you hands are wet it will take multiple attempts before giving access, most of the reviews I read about back panel color and material quality was negative as compared with other phones but personally i liked the color of back panel as I have the ocean blue you can call me old fashioned but there are many reasons like 1. It looks good,  2. Doesn't slips from you hand 3. Eventually you are going to use a back cover with it and etc, I have a transparent back cover over mine coz no other color would be that good as it's original, its display is one of the best as the picture quality and the color contrast and many other aspects cannot be compared with other phones in market, it also provided built in Dolby atmos when using earphone which totally changes the experience of audio while watching movies or listening songs its is just amazing, I was averagely satisfied with the camera as the night mode is not that good when compared with other phones, macro shots are very good but struggles a bit to focus, I did not find any much difference between slow mo and ultra slow mo, providing inbuilt custom stickers and emoji are good and enjoyable, speaker volume are good for a average noisy room conditions but not for listening songs outdoors, there are many gestures which takes time to get comfortable with but once you are life gets easier also there are many other features which proved helpful for day to day working environment, over all it is a best phone for average and heavy usage until and unless you are planning to play heavy games on it entire day long with heavy graphics requirementThank you 😁",0.9975,positive
"  A very disappointing buy.I've been using this phone for about 3 days, which is enough to know how the phone performs, and this phone is sub-standard. Let me list the reasons why:1. To begin with the finger print scanner response is very slow. Very often it doesn't recognize the finger.2. With a big battery I was expecting it to.last a day. But with playing light games like Temple Run and Words wirh Friends the battery runs down very quickly. It also takes a little over 3 hours to charge fully.3. Camera performance is pathetic. The 64mp pics look like it's been shot with 8mph lens. And don't even try a pic at night, you won't be able to see anything with clarity.4. The phone feels heavy and cumbersome though it's hardly a few gms heavier than my previous phone.5. The volume buttons are stiff and don't respond to a normal touch.6. The swipe hand gesture to take a screenshot is useless as very often the screen moves along with the hand gesture of you're taking a screenshot on a webpage or Instagram or any other social media app.And though I have more to say, I think this is enough to dissuade you from buying this phone. I'd suggest you go for either the Realme 6 or the Note 9 Pro at the same price.",0.8874,positive

"  My review after using the phone after 4 months of continuous use as I have ordered it on the day of launch 5th March.Pros:1. The battery is humongous. it's 6000 Mah. It will last for at least 2 days for normal use. For extensive use like 12 hrs of video stream then it will last at least 24-30 hours.2. Exynos 9611 processor comes with Mali-G72 MP3 graphics which are able to handle gaming relatively well.3. It comes with Android 10.0 which is layered with Samsung's own OneUI.4. The camera can capture 4K videos too and the camera quality is really  very good both rear as well as front.5. It has an impressive 6.4-inch Super AMOLED display with minimal bezels.6. It has polycarbonate back which isn’t as premium as a glass-back construction but does seem solid.7. The finger scanner is quick. It supports face unlock as well but it isn't fastest (Still does its job).8. With 6 GB ram, the performance is smooth. No issues so far. 128 GB storage is quite enough.9. It comes with a triple-slot i.e. dual sim option (4g+4g) and a memory card (You can expand up to 512 GB if need be).10. Pixel density is 403 ppi and resolution is 1080 x 2340 pixels.Cons:-1. Night mode isn’t the best.2. It supports a single speaker at the bottom, the audio output on the Galaxy M31 is decent but not rich enough.3. It doesn't come with earphones.4. It comes with a 15W type-c charger. It goes from 10 to 100 percent levels in about two hours. As per same price rahge competitors they could have given at least 25W or so.Conclusion:-If you are looking for a phone with best battery backup, good camera quality, best SAmoled display available in price range and a decent processor to handle day to day use with Samsung brand value.Regards,Yash",0.9834,positive
"  The phone is decent at this price point . I don't like the phone too much,as it has samsung branding so I expect more but at this price many phone available better than this but it's battery backup & display quality is best. But it's not a gaming phone, I don't like the Exynos processer for gaming. Overall good but not recommended for gaming & heavy usages. The main thing it's camera , it has 4 camera but don't think it's too good but I like the selfi camera which I mostly used. Best for old generation people.",0.9758,positive
"  Decided to buy samsung phone after using all known chinese brands like vivo,oppo etc in last 5 years. But after using for 15 days realized why samsung lost market share rapidly to the chinese players. The phone has the same issues tht samsung used to have 5 years back like getting changed,features like adaptive brightness doesnt work and pictures with 64 megapixel camera  leaves white patches on the face.phone has a lag and not fast .samsung seriously needs to review its product quality otherwise customers will surely dump it and go for Chinese brands",0.8634,positive
"  It's an upgrade to the M30s. The screen is good with a raindrop camera. The Super Amoled display is quite good to use even while at outdoors.The massive 6000 mah battery easily gives backup upto 1.5 days on moderate to heavy usage.It takes around 2 hours 40 mins to 3 hours on initial charging from zero to 100 percent.For Gamers there a Game Booster App.The camera is also quite good with lots of options to choose from.Cons:The phone has some bloatwares, some from samsung, and some third party like Helo app. Some apps like fb can only be disabled.Overall a Good Phone, and the massive 6000mah battery is really good for moderate to heavy users.",0.9806,positive

This was my first online purchase of this value and had concerns there. But was delighted as everything went smooth. There was a delivery OTP provided by Amazon hence the delivery person had to deliver to me in person which was good. I was worried that he shouldn't leave it with security in my absence. 2nd, the seller had packed it nicely, the primary pack seal by the manufacturer was intact hence a genuine new pack.

"  It has issue with proximity sensor. While calling screen keep on and off and you will face issue of call on hold, call recording, over heating, battery drainage etc.It is worst fon in my life.if you can use ear phone while call, then only you should buy it.When you keep your phone on ear while calling, screen should get off so that there should not be any accidental touch . But while talking most of the time screen turns back on... SO then your ear will touch the screen and the postion of menu and then call hold or recording option clicked.I checked with service center and also share video but they could not fix it. I submitted my phone to service center 2 times but issue is still there. They are saying it is due to location of proximity sensor in this model.Now I have no option.",-0.3483,negative
"  Its almost 3 months now. Giving review about this phone:PROS:1) Made In India, in Noida factory.2) Very good touch screen. You don't require screen guard, as its scratch resistant/scratch free.3) Superb battery life.4) Doesn't get heated after prolonged use.CONS:1) It doesn't have block number feature with prefix pattern. You have to add individual numbers. E.g. you know call starting with 140 are all advertisement calls. You can't ignore them simply by adding 140*, you have to individually add. Trucaller has this feature, but you require to install this 3rd party APP.2) SAMSUNG claims its a 15W charger. But if you know Wattage is Volt X Current. Its 5V, 2A charger, that is 10W. In short its weaker charger than what company claims.3) Its touch screen is very sensitive. If soap water etc gets on to the screen then even after cleaning by cloth, screen doesn't respond for long time. ""Accidental touch feature"" if you put ON then especially you get into this issue.Overall:Overall for this range with brand like SAMSUNG, its definately a good BUY. Much better than Chinese phones.",0.9493,positive

"  I purchased this mobile based on previous Samsung galaxy mobile experience. Now i've mixed feelings on it.These are my observations after single day use.1. Rear camera quality is extraordinary unless you zoom it.2. Front camera isn't that great. Beauty mode is always on and photos are patchy.3. Samsung KNOX isn't preinstalled. So, you can't use ""Secure Folder"". Need to install ""S Secure"" app for app lock.4. Guesture screenshot didn't work.5. Phone is slightly heated while updating and installing apps.6. OS is so smooth.7. Fingerprint reader unlocks the mobile swiftly.Update: after multiple days of regular use1. So far battery lasts almost 2 days with regular usage. Like YouTube, Facebook and etc.,2. Though it's of 6GB ram, I noticed lag and phone stuck frequently.3. Front cam needs a lot of improvement4. Call quality isn't that great5. You can hear full voice only when tye voulme is completely up or almost full. Same applies to earphones as well.Verdict: Go with this mobile if you're expecting a good rear camera and better battery performance.",-0.2737,negative

"  Edit: The third pic shows you what I had to go through, to get the phone repaired from Samsung service centre!! No social distancing, and many were not wearing masks properly! Read on...I wondered how Samsung is able to sell these mobiles (M series) at such an affordable prices competing with Mi, Oppo, and Vivo! Now I know the secret, it is done by lowering the “quality”! The M31 I bought for my sister did not last even a couple of months! It started as a small blue “dot” at the left corner and grown to an “inch wide” blue patch on the screen! Boom, within a week, you can not see anything on the screen except for that bluish patch that spread across. See the images.When we visited the Samsung service centre, traveling for about 80kms, the reception was extremely poor and rude! The person standing at the store entrance said “this is not covered under warranty” without even having a technician checking what is the problem! Basically looks like they are all trained to say that line. When we insisted to check what is the problem, the technician checked and told that there is a leak of the display liquid inside the screen and is due to a damage caused by a small pin (apparently it is a very minor one, that can be seen only with the technician magnifying glasses), that we never understood. Another thing I noticed is, most of the people at the service centre are with their “Samsung M series” mobiles in hand, which confirmed that this series is manufactured with low quality hardware and people have a lot of complaints about them!!We had to give the phone for display replacement, that costed us another ~6K on top of the 17K we spent for this! I could have bought Oneplus Nord by spending another 5K on top!! Waste of money and time 😑😑😑It’s a clear no to buy Samsung M Series!!!",-0.9634,negative
"  if you are purchasing forCamera - you can do better than this.Games - you can do much better.Battery life - even this will do , please do not expect miracles from 6000 figure.Phone , map , whats app or lots of apps ( productive apps not entertainment types ) at this cost with nice to touch feel - yes this is the phone you should consider.Screen - please buy this , screen image quality is so good , even a dull photo looks good.Phone looks - nothing jazzy , plain and simple15W charging is okay not fast types and when charging 6000 battery is like back to old school.Sound - a bit weak but its okay if you become DJ just once in two months.Software or bloatware - Samsung have better and useful products which all are not provided with this model as its a mid range but what all is given in not sufficient but with that kind of RAM and storage , go get how many do you like.Charger is not small but charging cable isGorilla glass is effectivePhone is not slim but far from uncomfortable.",0.8969,positive

"  Samsung Galaxy M31 did resonate to me, with another ‘M31’ - Andromeda Galaxy.In the universe of mobile-phones, Samsung M31 is a star in the galaxy of its kind.Why Samsung?Intrinsically, I am a fan of Samsung products.Excellent product design and manufacturing. Highly reliable. It was time to change my old 3G Samsung mobile. Finally I settled for this one.Why M31?In my professional life, I worked on R&D, and fabrication of VLSIs. That made me a perfectionist in the field of photography. So  I was looking for an affordable mobile phone as an aid to my DSLRs. This M31 met all my expectations.The Samsung M31.The high-resolution front and quad-camera system at the rear. Excellent exposure sytem. Brilliant colour rendition. All these through world class Samsung display.The hardware is perfectly matched with its operating syste. I was amazed using its never-used-before features. I found, there's more than one way to peel an apple. With its 6000 mAh battery the phone is very thin and light. Finally, true value for money.",0.9757,positive

"  This review is for users who mostly use mobile for calls, watching videos, some social media and photography!!Looks: This phone is Huge! For watching videos it is fun but handling it can be tricky... Plastic back is fingerprint magnet so cover is recommended.Screen: stunner! Big screen + amoled is great combination! Display is bright and Sunlight visibility also fine. Ambient light sensor works as expected.Always on display and double tap to wake up are handy features.Battery: it works as it should be! Typically lasts for 2 days with moderate usage.Few hours of youtube, long calls and even video calls(no gameplays)I am using it for a week now with 2 simcards.Charging is fast but due to huge battery takes long time if battery goes below 20%(Generally avoid draining phone to lower levels to maintain battery health and also to shorten charging time.)Performance: Everything works fine. animations are buttery smooth. RAM managements looks good. It's been only one week so i will update later if anything changes.Camera: Lovely! The main 64MP clicks only in 3:4 aspect ration but it is really crisp.Attached some sample shots.Macro lens surprised me! It is actually pretty useful and captures minute details, viole reproduction is also apt.Wide angle camera: This one i felt just ok! It should be minimum 13MP to give justice to details.Selfie cam: 32MP is more than sufficient! Clicks beautiful images. There are many things which selfie lovers might like.Video recording: stability is good. In low light it struggled little bit but overall no complaints. Hyperlapse and super slow modes are fun!Summary: If you want a mobile for your multimedia needs with long lasting battery, great display, fantastic cameras and Non China Brand you can trust this device!(Interestingly device came with Helo app preinstalled which is banned by govt. Had to uninstall it manually)",0.9972,positive
"  2 STAR TO 4 STARDEAR ALLIM writing the review after usage of Samsang M31 after one month. The below review was written after 2-3 days of usage of same. But after 1 month I chage my mind and believe it's one of good phone cader. Not bad as wat I have written below( my early review)Battery back up is too good and performance wise to its a MONSTER. Camera too good. The only area in which the phone lage is loud speaker. That they have to improve.👍👍👍👍🤳Thx allMy early review👇Very much Disappointed  with the product M31 I was previously  using MI A2. I bought this after so much research from review from Amazon.  The major disappointment was with speakers both loud speakers & phone speakers  quality  is not at all acceptable. Very cheap sounds never ever I used it before in my entire life time.I play free fire ( only game I have in my mobile)In MIA2 (6GB Ram ,128 storage ) I never got up hang my mobile. But in case of M31 (8GB RAM 128 STORAGE) I got hang every time 🤣🤣🤣If you have other options plz go for it. I will never come back to Samsung in my life time.I hesitate to go for redmi before I  buy MiA2. This time too I thought to for Mi. Still gone for Samsung. But it proved me wrong.",0.9705,positive
"  Hello All..I'm writing this review after few months of usage, but this should not be different as per my experience. I feel this instrument is having all necessary features in this price range for those who believe in smart work and nice user interface.I liked the most..- Android 10! Latest looks & works Beautiful...ahead of all- One UI is the superb experience as compared to other ones which are cheap. Feel the REAL look and damn useful features required for what is called as SMART WORK- Dark Mode is the best feature I wish for- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.- Performance is good. No heating or lagging.- 6000 mh battery is BIG- Both dedicated sim slots support VoLTE...i really appreciate this- The Mobile Mic and speaker is good and clear- Camera is really good.  Video stabilization option is excellent- Face unlock, figure-print sensor response is quickAdditional requirement- I wish Samsung should provide a screen guard and back cover along with the handset. This is very good business trend and customer convenience. This will also help to protect the instrument from Day1 of usage.Finally the icing on the cake is..If you are thinking to buy a new phone, you can always consider this on priority being proudly Made In India. The day is not so away...MONSTER will surely beat the DRAGON",0.9985,positive
"  ** Good or bad, Bot tells the truth **+ Good phone in this budget. There is no significant advantage to spend 10K extra on the M51+ Good camera in day light.+ Ok performance for apps. Display is sharp and responsive.+ Fast fingerprint reader. Lets you switch on the display without pressing any button. This increases the life of the power button.+ Good grip and round edges, feels good to hold the phone.+ Fast shipping, got it within 3 days.- Average camera in low light.- Display is too long and less wide, so youtube experience is compromised for full screen.- Default wallpapers have very low resolution, makes you fee the display is not good.- Battery is 6000 mAH but the backup time is only marginally higher than my 3000 mAH Samsung J7.- When I opened the packaging, the phone was already in switched on position and some extra apps were already installed. There was a small single scratch on the display as well. So do not expect a fresh piece when you order.- Annoying UI that will take time to get used to. Samsung should have opted for stock Android.",0.1385,positive

The contrast is such black even you cant make difference between the body black color and the screen black color. Phone looks very nice when I use dark mode.Battery: Monster battery, full usage will give you 1 and half day life. if average use then it will last for 2 days.Charging Cable: it is only 0.5 Meter, Samsung why why are you giving such small length wire? how much are you saving 50 INR? Also i found the charging cable is with poor quality.No Case: Generally silicon case we get by 150 INR outside, samsung would have given it then it was good. but its not there in box.Overall this product is superb choise if you have budget under 20K (for this variant of 8GB RAM 128 GN Storage)",0.9575,positive

"  I had been waiting to buy this smartphone since its launch. It has been a couple of days using it and I am very satisfied with the experience. The fingerprint reader unlocks the phone in a jiffy. The battery lasted over a day with moderate to high usage, including surfing, watching YouTube videos, using Spotify and making two long calls. It took me 2 hours to charge the phone from 20 to 100%, which is decent considering that the charger is a 15W one. The camera quality is really good, and although I have only taken photos of my answer scripts so far, I am looking forward to taking more photos with it. The processor is also great and it has been able to handle moderate levels of multitasking with ease. The display is bright and vibrant, and the sound quality is really good. Overall, it checks all the boxes, and makes it a true tool for the user.I would definitely recommend this phone to anyone who is looking for a decent budget phone. In this range it is definitely the mega monster that it claims to be.",0.985,positive
"  Camera: 3.8/5Battery: 5/5UI: 5/5Fingerprint reader: 4/5Screen: 5/5The first and foremost reason to buy it is that its not a China brand. Had a Mi phone which stopped working after 7 months had to visit service centre to replace battery which has warranty of 6 months. Charged me Rs.1880 for it. After raise issue to Mi CS atleast they refunded my Rs. 524.Now, about M31 if you looking for decent phone with Amoled screen and bigger battery this the phone for you.For some people not having glass body may feel like a deal breaker but for me whi has used a glass body phone with back cover doesn't feel like much difference, phone is 90% of time in back cover.Camera id descent for thus price range, won't  say the best but gives satisfactory results and quad camera setup many more options to play with.Samsung needs to upgrade from 9611 processor but still for a user like me it doesn't  make any difference.Any body looking to buy a new phone can wait and buy M31s which has a better charging and screen.",0.76,positive
"  I am using my new phone for almost a month now. The phone looks great and value for money to me. The delivery of Amazon was perfect. I will list down the pros and cons below:Pros1. Battery life of the phone is awesome. On medium usage it lasts for 2 days. The charging time is 2.5 hours though, which a bit high for charging 6000mAh battery.2. Screen, colors and resolution all are a masterclass.  Samsung and its screen are the best thing to have. There is some bezel in the screen and I didn't like the idea of curving screen at the corners. It is manageable though.3. Touch and keypad are good and responsive.Cons1. Processor on the slower side. Good for its category but definitely not the best.2. I didn't like the build quality of the phone.  While the shape is sharp and finish is good, I find the phone little bit bulky.3. The menu and options are not the most user friendly. I used an Oxygen os before and believe me it was much smooth in sorting things.",0.9716,positive
  Best smartphone in this budget.It has 4 rear camera with 64 mp main features.Selfies had good impressions due to 32 mp front camera.

  Got SG M31 more than a week ago. Ran into issues. Got in touch with CC and Tech support. They arranged a tech visit. Tech visit confirmed issues with the phone -- a replacement was done. Got a smooth working phone now and I have no complaints. Infact I want to thank all those involved in getting me  a replacement.Now for the phone itself. Big display--good display--but not HDR enabled though Vivid color setting does a pretty good job. I am not the Cheapo kind who takes selfies and uses a lot of Tik Tok so camera is not a big deal for me But the camera  is real good HDR pics are nice and slow mo and time lapse are amazing. Live focus is a amazing feature in camera. Sound quality is awesome and better than redmi note 6 pro which i was using earlier. Good snappy phone for daily app usage. I don't waste my time on games so no comments. UI is good with ease of use all around. Love the AOD display.Bought a sandisk type C usb otg but it didnt show in storage. Maybe I dont know how to use it. Overall a good phone and highly recommended. Happy bought a made in India phone will sell my old redmi note 6 pro to some anti-national.,0.9965,positive
"  Many people have written a lot about this phone. So let me give you my quick observation:1. Screen is good, but has yellow tint. People used to super bright screens will not like it.2. The max brightness is also not as much as other good quality phones.3. Battery life is ok at best. But that is because of Samsung os. You can enable it to kill more apps to preserve battery.4. Samsung one os is ok ok. Lacks many things in 2020! Scrollable wallpapers missing on home screen. Sms and calling app look outdated. App launcher is also ok ok. No issues have installed nova launcher. Can also recommend lawnchair.5. Sar value is low, so range is not max always. Some basic issues with wifi tooHope samsung will fix color tint issue and other os issues.So at almost 20k not worth it. But hey I bought it because it is not a Chinese phone. So extra money spent on nationalism. Jai Hind!",0.97,positive
"  Yes, the phone turns out to be knocking in terms of battery and other functionalities are also fine except wifi. Whenever i switch the phone on i have to manually open the wifi settings to connect it to the auto-connected wifi which had already saved. I don't know this is an issue with my handset or everyone, haven't contacted CC in this regard as not a huge issue. The main thing processor and ram management is also fine as mated with 8gb, but it's not meant for heavy gaming. As i play pubg and all.. fame do drop sometimes as i've noticed, which was not the story with my asus 5z 8gb variant, i miss that phone.But in terms of battery it's surely a deal breaker!

"  This is a short review after the first 24 hours of the M31 6GB 128GB black color phone I have bought. I had shortlisted Redmi9 pro max and this one as my top 2 choices for a 17000 or less phone. I opted for M31 for its 6000mah battery, oled screen and great camera. I am not a high end gamer but I do create a lot of memes, videos and posts for my social media. First 24 hours, this phone rocks  (my last phone is a Moto G4 plus). No heating issues. Screen is too good. Battery after 24 hours of hectic usage is still 40% remaining. 15w charger is not ultra fast but quite decent. Overall a great purchase decision. I will replace my other MotoG5 plus with this soon. Instead of spending 30k on one phone,  buy two at 15-16k each. This strategy has worked for me very well. What's most fascinating part about the last 24 hours is the Samsung app that moved some 28 GB of data files from my Moto in no time, effortlessly.  This is huge.So should you buy M31? Unless you are a high end gamer the answer is YES.",0.9762,positive

  Using this mobile for  almost 2 months now. Just before lockdown i bought it and it started hanging within a week so i wasn't able to place an exchange or return order complaint. The battery life is also very less as compared to other mobile phones I've used. Plus it mentions 6000mah which it definitely not at all acceptable.

Cant use it in one hand and the sensitivity is so high that even before pressing BACK button.., when typing something automatically that gets executed and it goes to a different screen.

Need to close all n open again to view from scratch.Buggy and  bulky model.Dislike same old UI icons. Bulky design like old mobiles. Camera is fantastic.

The m31 display is an upgrade over the M30. I don't know if I am wrong, but it is more crisp and has better contrast.But however I am disappointed with the battery. Even though it is 1000 mAh higher capacity, I have not noticed any significant difference over M30.But this is again compensated by a far better camera than the M30. The M30 camera was pathetic to say the least.This is however not as good as a realme or redmi. But, the display is light years better than the realmes or mis.",-0.4112,negative

PUBG in HD and ultra or HD smooth works very good for long hours of play. HDR with ultra lags sometimes. But HD ultra is the best setting for 1 hour of gaming.Last is build quality, i have blue and i thought it might look cheap plastic as seen in pictures , but blue looks semi premium , its not thick or bulky, when u have in hand its great.it does not have NFC so if you are in use of it then go for A51 else M31 is actualy a good deal .

So, for me value buying.But, if you see, in this pandemic situation (COVID19) and geopolitical scenario, when India is planning to ban Chinese Products, Samsung has a great opportunity to acquire Indian Market and can deliver flagship mobiles by reducing the price.Pros:1. Display2. Battery backup3. Wide-angle camera pictures4. Dolby Atmos is a good experienceCons: 1. BUILTIN QUALITY (made up of plastic) -->> could be metal built2.

Trust me my honor 8x mobile with just 3450 mah battery gives a similar back up. What is the point of buying such a phone then. Camera is good. Low light capture is efficient enough at this price range. Finger print sensor is okay. Not great as my honor 8x has a lightning fast finger 3sensor when compared to Samsung.

"  Bought this product when launched at its lowest price, had to wait quiet long for the product after intense surveying because I was avoiding high end phones because life of each phone is nearly same, and during the pandemic it was of utmost importance to save each penny instead of spending freely and also wanted to avoid phones manufactured by China.I had decided to buy a phone within 20K and this phone gave me all features which are in top end phones(30K-40K), off course there is difference in the quality.1.Camera picture quality- Though it has nice cameras(number wise e.g 64MP,32MP) clarity of picture is not so good,but worth it in this price range.2.Battery- 6000 mAh it says but it isn't actually its 5825 mAH and I use a third party battery application called accu battery which is especially for battery its charging speed,health,discharging,sleep time etc. and it shows around 5400 mAH, so can't be sure of battery, though they have got a certification regarding this but am not sure.3.RAM- I have 8GB ram version and its worth it in this price range. Sometimes it lags but that is acceptable.4.Internal memory- 128GB its satisfactory, what is even better that it has a dedicated slot for memory card and since  had onnem my previous device I was happy in it.Overall speaking it is a good range phone, especially it is MADE IN INDIA, of a South Korean company.",0.9771,positive

"  The best thing about this phone is not its battery but the display. And the most acclaimed battery (and its charger) is a disappointment because it takes 3 hours to completely charge. Who has 3 hours to keep the phone for charging? Samsung should have provided a faster charger that could charge the phone in an hour and a half at the max, and a 15min dash to charge it 30 /35 percent. Apart from this the phone is great. Even now, Samsung can come up with a fast charger and people would buy it as per the recommendation instead of going for some other company charger which may damage the phone or its battery. Moreover the completely charged phone is good to go for one and half day for moderate use.A little more details after a couple of months usage. This phone needs to be little more rugged as it can crack at edges and screen very easily. An aluminum/any metal body would be much better. The battery after 2hrs 20 mins charge can easily take you through the day with above moderate usage. For heavy users, still a fast charging option may be required at the end of day. I mean who keeps phone to charge for 2+ hours? You cannot risk charge it whole night too. Samsung has produced a nice phone. It could be a game changer with some more changes.",0.9551,positive
  Hello everyoneI was looking for a Chinese  budget smartphone since last 2 months..but when this boycott Chinese thing started.. I changed my mind.. and started looking for a made in india device.. samsung m31 is the one you are looking for under 20000. I have the 128+6 gb version.. the battery is super cool.. camera is also decent even in the night time. The night mode captures decent photos at night. The processor is decent and handle the apps pretty good.. despite of having a huge battery the phone is comparatively lite.. and it feels comfortable because of the edge on the side.. it helps in the better grip. Super amoled display is just wow.. better colours..accurate sharpness. Overall the phone is very good.. go for it without any doubtI hope this review is helpful.,0.9872,positive

Camera is also cool, but not that great, but it is good enough for the price you pay.The only thing I am little disappointed was it has some lag while browsing and if it is improved, the phone really rocks for the price.Overall when compared to chinese phones in the market, Samsung is really doing good in terms of service, trust and the value of the product.Also, would like to thank Amazon for fast delivery and awsome service.",0.9766,positive

"  ProsAmazing display quality.Top notch clarity on Amazon Prime on par with OnePlus kind of phones.Camera quality is great in 64pixel mode back cam and 32 pixel mode front cam. Macro shot, food shot are good. Live bokeh on back cam is ok and front cam live bokeh will disappoint.Battery backup is definitely better than a 3000 to 4000 mAh with snapdragon SOC.General processing, speed and animations are seamless.if you are a fan of Samsung ui you would love it.Finger print sensor is good as the best ones , it's fast enough.ConsAudio quality with a Sony Bass headset is not so great, frequencies and noise cancellation is not soothing, cannot match a Nokia 6 Dolby, if you are music lover, this phone will disappoint you. Yet sound with a Bluetooth speaker was good. Surround effects on Dolby mode are good but audio quality needs some work.I am not a fan of custom ui and someone used to the stock android & miss it, still can manage with launchers like Nova to get the stock android feel.Has a lot of Samsung and third party apps which you have to disable. Some cannot be disabled as well. Of the 6GB, 1.5 GB is wasted on these apps. So you practically have only 3gb left after the OS and Samsung apps, which is not expected of 6gb ram device. A stock android phone will offer more RAM and processing power in reality, with the same hardware.Exynos is worthy for normal use and I am not sure about gaming as I have not tried.Extra memory and battery are in place because of the bloatware the phone ships in. These are not annoying like the ones on Micromax or cheaper phones. Most of these genuine ones, but one may not use them.Larger battery makes the phone heavier, plastic body gives a false feel like the phone is not sturdy, the phone actually is pretty solid, if you have a case and glass you don't find a difference.Over all a worthy smartphone and worth its money.",0.987,positive

There are certain things i'd like to mention.Pros: great camera, you get the best pictures even in dim light (YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED IF YOU COMPARE IT WITH REALME PICTURES BECAUSE IT DOES NOT USE FILTERS, IT GIVES HIGH QUALITY PICTURES, IF U NEED BEAUTIFICATION THEN THE FEATURES ARE AVAILABLE IN CAMERA SETTINGS), finger print reader is upto the mark, screen is very handy, it has got some great inbuilt features, speakers are good for one room echo,face detection is also one great feature in it. Battery  is one great perk. I charge it once in 1.5 days.Cons: hangs a lot while transferring file to another phone,occationally malfunctions and restarts without command, follows command with a little delay at some point, as compared to my MI A1 i find this phone a little not upto the mark in terms of performance. Super slow in charging. It looks like it takes for ever to charge.Apart from the camera i dont think it has anything super good to discuss. Its like a regular phone that one can buy. We as youngsters  are more obsessed with the camera thing and battery life, hence this phone is everything in terms of those. I haven't played games on it and hence i dont know how will that be.I am rating it 5 beacuse the cons i mentioned are temporary, it does not affect over all performance. I am satisfied i keep downloading files, use microsoft office on it, play youtube,click pictures and little stuffs so it works fine for me.",0.9927,positive
"  Camera quality could have been upgraded. Evin though its 64MP, in low light  this is useless. Pic and video quality us bad in low light.Battery too doesn't last as for long. My Vivo U10 BATTERY performance is better compared to M 31 also the video and pic quality at night too is good if you compare it to M 31.The reason I purchased is because of the name Samsung. I somehow feel dissatisfied and disappointed.Price is ok and inbuilt memory is good.Have been using it from mid March 2020. Certain observations....a) twice the mobile restarted on it's own.b) heating issues when charging.c) on two occasions the mobile took around 6 hours to charge (100%).Now here is my review after the recent software update. I am giving it an additional star 🌟 from 3 to 4 .Major improvement are1. Cammera Single takes.2. Pic quality3. Video quality. Needs more improvement in stability and quality in night mode.4. No laging or hanging of phone. Automatic restart of the mobile has stopped.Overall the phone is great. I am now a satisfied owner of this mobile",0.893,positive
"  YOU SHOULD KNOW WHY THIS IS SUPER MONSTER. MUST-READ.Samsung has literally poured premium qualities in this phone.1)CAMERA - Quad Camera rich quality photos. Even after Zoom, details are very clear & No blurs at all. low light snaps are clear & stunning. Compared to under 20k Chini brands like (Viv/opp/Rme/Rmi) this is unmatchable.2)SENSORS - All sensors are quick, most importantly they're consistent & reliable (Which indicates its durability, Quality & long-lasting capacity).3)DISPLAY - Super AMOLED + Full HD = Baap of all displays. Glorifying video experience. Touch Response is quick & so far no single glitch.4)MUSIC QUALITY - Built-in DOLBY ATMOS technology. You'll experience the distinct Thump of bass. (also depends upon on the quality of your headphones like How much it supports to this technology)5)CALL QUALITY- Premium mic quality. Crisp & Clear voice calls. Supports almost all CODECS including Aptx6) RAM - Best RAM management, even after you play heavy graphics games along with complex tasks, you'll see approx 1.5gb still left. That means your phone is breathing easily even in heavy usage. NO HEATING.7) PROCESSOR - Many Reviewers are misleading on this by comparing snapdragon. but, few this months old Exynos 9611 chipset has mastered with 6GB ram to ensure thriving experience & to perform any task no matter what you doing on your phone. So far No complaint about the performance & during multitasking & Gameplay.8)GAMEPLAY - Heavy graphics GamePlay like Ark, pubg, Minecraft etc are fluent. So far No frame drop, even in high settings. Recommending to use Built-in Game Booster feature for Thriving Gaming experience along with AMOLED graphics. Just Imagine.9)BATTERY - 6000mAh juice will give you an output of approx 2 Days on avg use & 1 day(20hrs) on heavy usage.SUMMARY -  If you looking for a maintenance-free consistent device for 3-4 years then Go for It without hegitation.",0.9725,positive
"  Moved from a Moto G5s Plus to Samsung .Pros :1. S-amoled display is just fluid , smooth and oh ghosh the deep blacks and the punchy colors . Undoubtedly the best display under 17K .2. 6000mah battery easily lasts for a day and half with heavy usage like 2hrs of Pubg , lots of social media stuff , photographs . The POWER MODE especially is phenomenal .3. 64Mp Camera is a beast when it comes to details but the 16MP ( pixel binning ) auto mode is the best where this device shines as the HDR and algorithms by samsung are just so perfect . No image over processing nothing . The Ultra Wide is the best as said by many top reviewers and it has distortion correction as well where as the Macro camera captures details and quality as it's a 5MP shooter .4. Exynos 9611 well its brilliant . Don't go for the benchmarks . Performance is superb bcz of the optimization . No lags and stutters . PUBG plays at HD and High frame rates by default and plays smoothly as well . That was a surprise to me also bcz I never thought of exynos handling games so good .5. The phone is not too heavy and looks pretty good overally and the Dolby atmos has its own magic when you're connected to bluetooth or wired headphones .6. The fingerprint scanner and the face unlock are supremely fast unlocks within a second and the Samsung UI over android 10 makes this phone the best midranger out there .Cons :1. The speakers of the phone naturally reduce while playing PUBG but it's not the case in playing other games .2. The back of the phone is plastic and thus it's a fingerprint magnet genuinely. Do buy a back cover for avoiding scratches.",0.9976,positive
"  I received this pohne from Amazon yesterday. Let me start by saying that this phone is completely Made in India and the quality and finish is as good as any other imported phone that you will get.The specs of the phone are simply awesome and for the price it is an excellent buy. The Amoled screen is very good and has a Gorilla Glass hence there is no need for a screen protector, but no harm if you want to put one. It is advisable to have a back cover as the finish is shiny and could be a bit slippery.I have still not used the camera extensively but from the few pictures that I took during the daytime, they are very good.Took early for me to comment on the battery life but it comes with an awesome 6000 mAh which lasts for a very long time. Of course this will be dependent on what you use the phone for.It comes with a 15W fast charger. It charged the phone from 65% battery to full in little over one hour.Transferring all your stuff from your old phone to the Samsung M30 was a simple straight forward affair using the Samsung Smart Switch. You will need to download this on your old phone from Google Play Store. I did the transfer using the wireless mode.The specs of this phone are unbeatable for the price.",0.976,positive
  Awesome Phone... No problem at all.... Simply mind blowing.... I would like to appreciate more that customer care executive to whom i talked the very first time. She was so polite and friendly and after understanding my problem she made this delivery on priority basis and it got delivered on time. The second representative was also good and i would like to appreciate him also. Please call me back tomorrow so that i can appreciate both of them on live call. It's a humble request from my end.,0.9796,positive
"  I have been using M31 from last 3 months here are some pros and cons...Cons•Fingerprint sensor Dose not recognise sometimes, i tried to setup it again but had same issue. But since I updated my phone to latest firmware it seems to work fine.• The rare of this phone is made out of plastic which fells cheap and it scratches easily I recommend getting a Good case.•The font camera takes poor pictures indoors. Trust me it's nothing like 32mp it's just number.• Performance is not that good if compare it with Realme or Redmi devices. But here is the thing performance seems to be improved with last update. I’m noticing less lag. Just don’t get this phone for gaming the chipset isn’t good enough.Pros•Samsung is known for their Super AmoledScreen, this is one of the best display you can get under 20k. You will love watching HDR content on Netflix, YouTube etc.•On rear there are 4 cameras but i think you will only going to use ultra wide and wide. The depth camera is for portrait mode, And there is micro one for close up subject but quality isn’t good. The main 64mp camera is decent, quality is pretty great in day light but in low light it’s average. night mode dose it job in low light but use tripod if you can. Ultra wide sensor is great in bright day light.•LDAC support over Bluetooth is pretty sweet you will enjoy music on this phone if you have Hi-Res supported headphones.•This phone has 6000mah battery which is insane you can easily get throughout the day without charging your phone even if you’re heavy user you will be able to use this phone all day.So overall i think this phone best for media consumption. Watching Netflix, youtube, playing basic games, using  social media...If you’re heavy gamer who plays PUBG, COD like game this device isn’t for you. So if you don’t play graphics demanding games on your phone you will like this phone....",0.9981,positive

"  This is a all rounder -1. Battery life is good, Though it would have made a little more sense if they had provided a better wattage charger then 15W. Plus side the battery life would last longer so.2. Camera quality is good. Though some reviews say not up to the mark - as the issue is there a separate option to use 4:3 64 MP which needs to be selected. Out of the box the default settings is 4:3 16 MP. This should help differentiate. This is in a way ok as 64 MP will use a lot of space for each picture as the size ratio is high.3. Display is the best as always.4. RAM any thing from 4 GB works well - Moderate use not talking about heavy gaming.5. Overall happy with the product and price is the best for such spec.",0.9794,positive
"  Horrible camera. Kept fluctuating and shaking. Took it to Samsung service center. No one listened till I insisted and then they still said nothing wrong - that will happen. Finally, sold it in 12,000 as it was unusable and bought another company. Samsung should be ashamed making such bad cameras which have 0 stability and focus. Be warned before buying.",-0.9108,negative
"  I use my phone for almost around 18 hrs in 24hrs!! I don't know if the heating issue is due to that or not. But its getting heated up after using it for few mins. If you have your phone idle for sometime it cools down but then the instant you start to use it, it gets heated up. Can't have it over ear to speak on a call.PERFORMANCE : 4 starsCAMERA : 5 stars, too cool!!! Jus as promised!!BATTERY: 3 stars, cuz once its below 30, it starts to drain too quickly.SPEAKER: When playing COD/PUBG in landscape mode, the fingers goes over speaker and restricts the audio... Which is really annoying. If you switch to the other way, the notch takes up space and hides game controls like firing button.AUDIO JACK : Could've been on top. Being in bottom is so annoying that i couldn't place my phone over ground while on vid call.SCREEN CAST : Works perfectly. I tried with my Mi smart tv and its cool.Everything else is fine.Would be perfect if heating issue is fixed.",0.8845,positive

I am very unhappy, plus mobile data speed was good in my old redmi,, in this phone it takes lots of time.. we get irritate of it.  I trust on my Amazon a lott but i understood the issues of phone later as i started using very late. So 7 day return window was closed otherwise i would have returned it.

"  The Box Contents :The Phone, Charger(15W), C-Type Charging-cum-usb Cable, Some Related PapersFirst Impressions :The Package was packed well and the Samsung  Box was compact.The phone has a impresive design and the weight was well distributed.After a week usuge:1. Display: As the Specification refers, it is sAMOLED. The brightness is well maintained  even in bright sunlight  you see the display  pretty  well. The viewing  angles  are also good. No color  changes  when views angles  gets changed. No queries  from my side.2. Body: The body is Plastic Back built with Gorilla  Glass 3 protection  at the front, the body felt a bit heavy as compared  to other phones  of this budget  section( of course thanks to massive battery).3. SIM Tray: The sim tray has the 2+1 Sim and MicroSD slot.4. Front Camera: Performed  well in Natural as well artificial lighting. Can see the detailed  texture  on the face(just turn off the Beauty  effect) and the one of the main function  is that during  calls, front camera  is used as ambient  light sensor  to turn off the screen. Some may find this not helpful it's  all about the habbit  that is to be developed with time.5. Speakers: Single speaker at the bottom right. I played  musics of high  frequency  and bass, at high sound it losses  it quality a bit but yes at 70-80% volume the sound was good and satisfying.The ear piece sound quality  is exceptionally  great.6. Rear Cameras:  The design  of Quad Cameras  impressed me, on the top left it got a 5MP sensor and below that we got a 64MP main camera module and below that we have a 8MP wide-camera and on top right corner we got a 8MP wide angle-lens and below it we got a single LED flash.The 64MP images are out the box. But you will notice  the overall  quality  of normal 16MP photos  are a bit rich as compared  to 64MP photos as capturing  image in 64MP and rendering  it to 16MP increases  it's  quality.The Live Focus  is impressive and the blurring  edge of the photos  is great in natural light but found a bit low in artificial  lighting.  I am satisfied very well.The wide camera Performed  pretty  well and got satisfactory  results.I am bit disappointed  with the Macro Lens that didn't  performed well, however  in multiple  shots I got a good quality  macro photo. But using main camera  for macro photos gives great results.The LED was pretty  good but it can be a bit more brighter but who cares, when it has a 64MP camera with night mode. Yes the night mode is exceptionally  well.7. Battery:  Yes the massive  6000mAH battery  is worth  called massive. I got the screen-on period  of 10hours in a single  charge.  On using it in a average way gave me around  30 hours of backup.8. Performance:  I experienced  buttery smooth  performance in using  it in above average usage.  But I will say that you can get  a bit lags in heavy task like playing heavy games. Yeah, you will not get that performance  as it doesn't  got a gaming  processor.But in daily routine jobs you can depend on it always you will never get a lag.The only visible  difference  between  M30s and M31 is that the Camera Module area is 2MM wider in M31 and the placement  of secondary  mic. is in top left in case of M31 and which  is on the right in M30sAs a average user 60Hz display  is okay for me, I didn't  experienced  any frame  drops.Overall the phone is pretty impressive and will never let you down in day to day task but for gaming you will face some issues like a bit heating, frame drops at high settings.I will reccomend  this product  for average  users. This phone performed well in medium setting in gaming and has a good AI in camera. It is good for photography and this 6GB/128GB black version is just out of the box.",0.9989,positive
"  I mainly got samsung for its battery life.. usually I'm comfortable with Nokia for its battery life and rough handling..and previously I had Nokia sirocco..  this time I was considering poco and samsung m 31.. it's a good budget phone with very good battery life.. I use it for watching videos and it comes for 2 days.. camera quality is good for me, though not like nokia 8 ,but good enough for the price..I don't take selfies.. I've put the phone down from hip level 3 times accidentally and it has not broken so far.. better to have a flip cover for protection.. so my overall experience is very good as I got it after reading a lot of specifications.. I don't play games so I don't know about that.. why I didn't choose poco or redme was coz of the ads and battery life..hope it helps..",0.9642,positive
"  After using the Samsung Galaxy M31 with 6 GB ram and 128 GB storage for more than 2 months, I list following pros and cons:A. Pros1. Very good display quality. Watching videos is a delightful experience2. Quad camera and selfie camera are very good. Low light photos in night mode are excellent with the 64MP main camera3. Fingerprint sensor is very accurate and fast4. Apps load quickly as expecteB. Cons1. Battery life is not as expected from 6000 mAH massive battery. Lasts about one and half days with normal use. Few phones with smaller batteries last for same time.2.charging the battery fully takes a very long time (about 2 hrs 15 mins from 15% to 100%) inspite of ""fast charging"", which is very disappointing.Overall the phone is very good and highly recommended.",0.9501,positive
"  For camera:Change lens to 64 mp in camera setting. Change camera resolution to fhd or uhd.Using macro requires a little bit of understanding.Battery has 3 modes always keep on medium amd check the optimised button. While sleeping keep it on maximum.These are the issues people are facing because they have not fully set their phones.Now,The camera is genuinely amazing. Night shot are extremely well colored and aren't dull.Processor - the exynos 9611Simply put it resembles 675AIE in performance than the 722 AIE. So, that's one factor you need to consider.What does it mean?It means playing  PubG in ultra graphics will be a problem. Just that, at the extreme frame rate the phone will not be able to do it.Note:only at extreme frame rate dies the phone sort of fails.For everything else the maximum RAM usage is 4.2 and then under device care ckean your RAM. Also set the time to automatically clean your phone.Samsung UI is extremely good. It resembles stock android and the bloat ware is not annoying.Screen is next level. sAMOLED screen does its job.",0.944,positive
"  I am not sure what but I feel something is missing. The finger print sensor is not good. Sometimes it does not read finger print and we have to enter the pass code or pattern.

"  What can I say! When the phone arrived I really loved it, it looked a little heavier than my last phone, but otherwise it was good.But then why this one star review!Few days later, the phone was accidentally dropped from a height of around 1 foot and the display broke. The phone would not turn on no matter what I would do. I decided to take it to the service center thinking that this would be covered under warranty, but they clearly said this would not be covered. The display panel would cost more than 5k and I would need to wait at least 7 days. Fine, I thought. Then I received a call letting me know that the part is not available, so they will give me a refund coupon after deducting the cost of the part thats not in stock. Okay. I got the coupon. The coupon by the way can only be redeemed at designated samsung stores and not everywhere. It is also not redeemable online. So, I went ahead and got the lesser mortal M21 deciding not to invest much in any other Samsung mobile phone. But seriously I have used Lenovo and Honor and Vivo in the past. Why would a mobile handset be so fragile in 2020! It reminds me of the time when first these kinds of smartphones were introduced and one had to be really careful. Not only that, I saw many people with M31 queuing up outside the service center. I don't think the present mega review online justifies the experience of many users.Parting questions -1. Why create such a fragile phone?2. Why no spare parts available? Does it mean there are huge complaints already?Dear Samsung, honestly I expected better.",0.9476,positive
"  Before zeroing in on the Samsung Galaxy M31, I researched the smartphone market in India and tabulated the data in terms of specs. For those looking to not give their money to the Chinese who are using the money to attack our country, among the Non-Chinese smartphones, the M31 presented the most bang-for-buck on paper.The M31 really good in every department, including in its massive 6k mAh battety, its AMOLED display, Android 10 OS, 6GB of RAM, 128GB ROM, Samsung's slick UI.At the sub 20K price range, the phone is an excellent buy.For photographers though not so much since it does not fully support CAM2API. Photographers can snag the Asus 6z, for its throw away price of 28k. The 6z supports shooting in RAW as well, unlike the Samsung M31.For the regular Joe though, the Samsung Galaxy M31 is a pocket friendly Non-Chinese phone option that is compelling.Amazon's delivered 1 day ahead of schedule.",0.8449,positive

  It is the best phone for the budget from a brand lik samsung all though there is small flaws lik the main 64mp cam is a wide angle lens which looks a bit odd wit a slight fish eye effect and in low lighting it produces lot of noise but u get good detailing and the colour reproduction is amazing and lastly the processor could hv been even better i feel its not that its bad now but still could hv been better overall i rate an 8/10 for the mobile and s 1 more thing u should be aware of is that it doesn't support Samsung pay and Knox.

"  Okay so writing the review after using the product for 23 days..the product is good overall but there are many things i would like to mention here...first of all if u r a xiomi mobile user don't go for this one because it is not at all easy to use devices when it comes to its features compared to xiomi ..you have to install music player,app lock separately and in the applock of samsung u cannot hide notifications of particular apps...camera quality is really not satisfying as it says it is 64 mp camera...coming to battery life i would say it is good ..if phone is 100% charged then it survies for 8 to 9 hours of use...and if you use phone moderately it can survive for 12 hours max..i don't know phone has screen recording feature or not as i am unable to find it till now...it has a bit of heating issue i must say..my phone got hang for 5 to 7 minutes today itself and not even power button was working..setting is quite confusing or i may say not easy to use...i hope in next update they will make it better..Now coming to pros of the phone...even being 6000mah battery it gets charged comparitavely to other phones..speakers are awesome...fingerprint sensor works too quickly...camera captures good pictures in dim light also..processor is fantastic as it works without taking any time even if u are working on many apps at a time...",0.833,positive

  Well 5 stars to Amazon delivery and service team.The phone I received had some issues with voice quality. It had a weird vibration and echo that use to come while talking. And calls did go blank in between. Not a network issue as I tried using multiple sim.They scheduled a replacement after a technician visit. Same issue persisted. So may be its defect in the make.Camera quality was pretty average. Pictures in day light were decent. Under low light the quality is horrible.Battery life of the 1st model I received was good. Charged pretty fast too.

"  Camera is good, call quality is good but the other person's voice can be heard outside even though the volume is low, when you are on call, which is a flaw in samsung phones.Speaker quality when you are speaking from a distance, in WhatsApp video calls is not good. I tried this with MI and they are much better.The major drawback is the claim made by Samsung about fast charging. Only 35-40% gets charged in one hour. So it takes almost 3 hours for full charge. I had Motorola G5 Plus which charged 60-65% in one hour, which means full charge in 1.5 hours.",-0.7398,negative

"  Update: 03Jun2020Visited Airtel store today and the customer care exec told me that all new phones autimatically switch to WiFi calling for better call quality.But I disagree.  Given the fact that WiFi calling is disabled in system settings, how can it be automatically switched to Wi-Fi calling?Still stuck. Samsung... Please help... Honour the phones system settings.-----First Review:The phone is very good in everyday usage.The only problem faced is that the phone automatically switches to WiFi calling while making or receiving a call despite turning off WiFi calling. The network is Airtel.This results in a situation where once the call starts, data gets switched off. No internet connectivity. So cannot talk and connect to internet simultaneously.Am writing this after a lot of googling to find a fix for this.The phone has April 1 2020 patch applied.Can Samsung or anyone out there help fix this problem?Also let me know if it is an Operator related issue (please mention what the operator needs to fix) so I can talk to the concerned.",0.9307,positive

Over all for people who have issues with Samsung this phone, i do not agree as i am experiencing  best mobile phone. Camera quality is perfect and features  are so easily accessible. Under 20 k if someone is looking for  perfect and durable mo ile phone, then bilndedly go for this without hesitation. Amazon too delivered very fast and there was no issie in transferring  previous phone data to this one. Thank you Samsung  and thank you Amazon.",0.9869,positive

  Bought this phone instead of an iPhone SE 2020 as I was seriously looking to get rid of the crappy Chinese junk that I had been using do far. Done basic online research and I realised that both the M31 & A51 run the same processor. However M31 comes with a much bigger battery and a better camera both important features in my decision making. It's been a little over a month and I have no regrets. The phone is butter smooth in operation while I get a proper two day battery break up. The camera is sharp and produces amazing results. This is a phone for people who want a phone for basic day to day working. Emails calls browsing and reading selling with social media and watching videos all of it the phone does masterfully well. Gamers may not like this handset but they are a different segment altogether and this phone is not for that segment. I would recommend this to anyone with my eyes closed.,0.7227,positive

Looks like my 2008 computer built in webcamSamsung apps that can't be removed. (Why add bloatware that no one uses anyways?)Plastic body while Redmi has metal bodies at the same price pointStill, a great phone at this price. I keep hearing rumors about how Samsung phones slow down after a few years, I'll see if that's the case and update this review accordingly. But right now, I do recommend buying it.",0.7989,positive
"  Camera clarity is same as 48mp in Redmi note 8. There is no difference. 5MP macro is very waste comparing with 2MP macro in Redmi note 8 (better) and I am Very much upset that in this price range samsung is not providing the clarity  and IR blaster which is not included.  One more thing I don't know why Samsung is not providing headphones now, there is no back case or screen guard.  Please try to include.Not satisfied with CAMERA @ 64MP rear and 34MP Front..  these figures are just for mentioning only but not providing actual clarity.And one more thing..This product is not a scratch proof glass/ Corning gorilla glass. Scratches has happening continuous while putting in the pocket.",-0.1191,negative
  Soo this phone is good to buy. It has a decent processor. It has great battery life. Its camera quality is a little bit low in low light or medium light but great in daylight. Selfie camera is great better than most of the phones in this budget range. I have seen some lags in this phones.....not much but still. Best thing is that i can move my apps from internal storage to sd card as most phones not allows this thing. It doesn't heat much even at games like Fortnite or pubg. Speakers are good but in headphone u got dolby atmos support which makes experience of listening music games in headphones great.,0.9909,positive

"  Booked on 9 th August and Got delivery on 10 th August.From very starting seen the battery charging issue. Even for charging for more than 6-7 hours never charged to full capacity. After 30 days situation worsened. So it landed to service centre. Another story can be written on  experience with Samsung service centre. ( to mention one thing --Not single employee wears mask at service centre .. seems all are superhuman) .So  after using hardly for 30 days  it's gone to service centre and found issue with charging port. Brand new equipment with charging port issue??? What's next awaiting God knows.Now can't return it, as return period is only 10 days after purchase.

I placed replacement order and I got replacement.After receiving replacement, I ordered M21 (4GB 64gb) and accordingly I received the mobile. But now both the mobiles are showing one problem and i.e. apps are flickering (i mean apps mobile screen become black and while suddenly while running apps)This problem arose for M31 after replacement period ended. I had to place replacement order for M21. But it is on the way. Few days before I had ordered another mobile to gift someone.

"  One serious issue i got after using it for a month, and i also read many similar comments in samsung community that is the restart issue. The phone sometimes restarts suddenly when we are still using it. And I really dont get any clue why this happens. No warnings, no reasons displayed. It just restarts suddenly..It has happens approx 6-7times during the last month.Overall it's good. But there features which are different from what I expected.The charger is not that slow. It's good enough.The battery doesn't last that long as I expected. Its above average.The position is of earphone jack is at the bottom, which is not convenient for me personally. Especially during video calls, it better to have at the top.The RAM is 6GB but 2-3gb is pre occupied. So I suggest only go for 6GB RAM.The loud speaker could be better in terms of quality as well as intensity of loudness.Overall it's a very good phone.",0.969,positive

"  Its been over 3 months now with this phone. Some highlights :1. super amoled screen- probably the best display in the 11 to 20 k rupees segment, hands down. Much needed if are like me and you read alot on kindle etc. Having used an amoled once, won't go opt for other screens ever!2. Free VPN with Samsung max, so better privacy3. Its Made in India, and the ultimate profits go to South Korea, where samsung is headquartered (not China).4. A pretty low Sar value. So a much safer phone than its competitors, especially Chinese brands, in terms of the amount of radiation u are exposed to.5. Battery life is not that great as they proclaim to be, but it's still good.6. The camera is pretty good in this price range, and the front camera also does its job pretty well. (Tip- you need to change snge the default resolution of the camera to 64 mp to utilize the full power of the lens. Many people don't do this, and then they write bad about the camera)7. A fast charger- thought not as fast as other high end phones, the charger is a good improvement from standard chargers in this price range.8. Much more reliable than Chinese brands, and rest assured, they won't steal your data and won't snoop on you.What it doesn't have - an IR blaster, But that's not a big deal.",0.9878,positive

"  I got a 8Gb 128Gb variant. The phone is great value for money. I'm sure everyone's read the specs and are looking for more user experience insights, so here goes mine. I wanted to buy a phone which gets latest security patch updates at least for the next 2-3 years (else my office mail doesn't work). I also wanted one that was made in India and owned by an Indian entity. A phone meeting both requirements doesn't exist. So the next best option is a good phone (security  patch) made in India by an entity that does not have a Chinese owning entity. Options were Panasonic (Jap) and Samsung (Kor). I've used Samsung phones before so went for this which had the following pros:1. Made in India2. 6Gb/8GB RAM3. 64/128 Gb ROM4. Fast processor (handles heavy apps with ease)5. Smart finger print sensor with notification scroll feature6. Awesome battery backup7. Nice pics for this price8. Amazing display9. Great sound quality, enhances the music experience on external speakers too.10. Auto disable screen timeout when face detectedThere may be many more features I don't use.. but I'm a typical person mostly using for work and some web surfing. I don't play games so don't know.On cons (explaining why I gave 3 stars) is only one.. the first phone delivered started shutting down on its own after a day. I quickly raised a replacement request and I got a new one and that's working great but the hassle of having to do all that is not nice.  I also read that this issue is there a lot. So Samsung needs to take note and fix this.Otherwise awesome phone guys 15-20k range, this is by far the best phone. And it's made in India!! :) go for it guys!",0.9903,positive
"  I had high expectations on Samsung M31, but after  using  for about  one Month, I found it not very impressive. I'm writing  this honest  review as per my observations.Pros -1. Display is very good.Cons -1. Charging takes too long, from 30% to 100% charging, it took more than 2 hours.2. In regard to battery lasting, I don't  find much differencebetween my old realme 3 pro which has 4045 mah and this phone which is claimed to have 6000 mah battery. I have to charge everyday.3. Most irritating is while attending calls in our ears it automatically goes to onhold mode and also call recording  starts automatically while placing the phone in our ear though automatic recording is off. Samsung should really work with these issues and correct the software options during calls.4. Finger and eyes sensor is also not so swift like my old realme 3 pro.5. Main Camera is also not very impressive upon comparing  my old phone but yes front camera  for Samsung M31 is better.I hope Samsung  will soon correct all these issues.",-0.609,negative
"  The Galaxy M31 is comfortable to hold in the hand but is a little heavy at 191g. The weight of the smartphone is mainly because of the big 6,000mAh battery that it packs.

"  Premium phone for a great price.The Samsung Galaxy M31 features a 6.4-inch full HD+ AMOLED display with 2340x1080 pixel resolution. The display is protected with a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass 3 on top.Samsung Galaxy M31 runs Android 10 operating system topped with the company’s own layer of One UI 2.0. The user interface is quite clean and the large app icons give a nice look to the device. There is also an app drawer where users can hide all the apps and can keep the home screen clutter-free. Like other Samsung smartphones, this one also comes preloaded with all the usual Samsung apps along with some third-party apps such as Facebook, Amazon, Snapchat, and others. Samsung has not included Bixby in the Galaxy M31 and along with this the Bixby Vision app is also missing from the device. The device also comes with Digital Wellbeing and Parental Control options which array of usual gestures. For instance, users can double-tap to wake the device and users also have an option to hide the three-button navigation layout and use full-screen gestures to control the smartphone.The camera is one of the major updates which comes with the Galaxy M31. The Galaxy M30s has a triple rear camera, while the Galaxy M31 sports a quad-camera setup. The rear camera of the device comprises 64MP main sensor, 5MP macro camera, 8MP ultra-wide lens, and a 5MP depth sensor. On the front, you will find a 32MP selfie camera. The company claims that both the cameras are capable of recording 4K video. Samsung has also added Night Mode in the camera for better photography experience. Like always the Samsung camera app is pretty clean and easy to use and users can find different modes to shoot within the app. Along with this, the app also offers a toggle that allows users to switch between the primary and wide-angle lens cameras. There is also a Scene Optimiser present in the app, which quickly detects the scene and set up the camera accordingly. We were quite satisfied with the camera results of Samsung Galaxy M31. The device was quick to focus and also offered an ample amount of detailing in the images captured. Swinging on the wide-angle lens camera offers a wider field of view along with some really good images. However, we personally loved the macro camera which offered really detailed images. The images captured in daylight were better as compared to the ones taken indoors. The Night Mode incorporated in the device also does a reasonably good job and it reduces noise from the images taken during the night. The 32MP selfie camera does a satisfactory job as both the selfies taken indoor and outdoor turned out to be good.6000 mAh battery with 15W fast charging support. Unlike other smartphone makers, Samsung has included a fast charger within the box. We were able to get through the day of mixed usage with a single charge, courtesy the powerful battery Samsung has packed in.The Samsung Galaxy M31 is a good option if you are looking for a device under Rs 20,000. It offers some really good specifications such as a quad-camera setup and a 6000mAh battery and that too with fast charging support. In terms of performance also the smartphone will not disappoint you. The smartphone comes under the budget segment but it doesn’t look like one.",0.9871,positive
  Overall  nice mobile! But charging speed is little bit slow minimum it requires 3 hrs for full charge from 0 to 100% . Except that I can't even find out any issues! No heating problems unlike other mobiles . mobile case is not provided  by Samsung . Camera quality is awesome. Fingerprint sensor speed and  recognition is fine. Minimum 1.5 day you can use this mobile with out any worries about charging even heavy usage. Overall One of the best mobile from Samsung in this price range. So surely I will  recommend this mobile to my friends.after five month of usage till now I won't change my opinion one of the best mobile in this segment. But now Samsung  m31 s is the best competition but SAR value is very low in this mobile. Samsung is best one.,0.9919,positive

What surprised me is that, no screenguard is already on it and we have to purchase one seperately. I already bought a flip cover for the phone which is doesn't actually do the guarding of screen for minor scratches. Samsung should pre apply a screenguard to smartphones, 20,500 phone and is not a small amount too. We checked the phone everything was good. The camera quality is sub-par.

"  Disappointing. Can't get worst than this. Firstly received a faulty phone which never got switched on. I did not have option to return, only replacement was available. It took additional 9 days for the replacement to reach me that too after multiple conversations and ""so called"" inspection and all. After all this when I got the phone which was fortunately in working condition, I'm not at all happy with the output1- finger recognition is not very good, you have to tap hard.2- Face direction doesn't work on multiple accounts.3- phone takes forever for charging. How can they not provide fast charging in the phone of today's generation?4- phone is extremely slippery. Impossible to use without cover.5- speaker volume is pathetic.6- camera quality is okay okay.7- picture quality is pretty good.I will not at all recommend this phone. I'm sure samsung was able to sell huge number of handsets but they are only trying to ride on anti-china notion going on currently. Since there are very less option if you do not want to buy Chinese phone, many would buy m31. However, this phone more look like ""something built in hurry in an effort to deliver at comparatively lower price but without much R&D"". Dear Samsung, I was not expecting this from you.

  All are good but I don't think that 6000mah battery works like 6000mah ...battery life not up to the mark what I have desired ...samsung engineers must work on it .otherwise all things are perfect..compared to the price but those who say that 6000 mah battery goes for two days they are wrong  it works max 12 hrs on screen continuously but if u are not a hardcore user it works 1 day full. Those gyz who says in you tube that it works 1 and half day or two days ..that does not perfectly match with the reality.One more think charging time is very high u need 3 hrs to recharge it from zero to 100%.

This amount advertisement greed is unparalleled in the 6 Samsung phones i have bought over time including Note. Basically you end up paying for a higher end cpu to process meaningless advertisemnt information abd battery life suffers. All this is packaged under AI name.  I will not buy samsung anymore, however attractive their display. Choose ASUS or worst case iphone. Or google phone.",-0.8519,negative
"  I used moto g 5 plus for 3 years before this. After having extensively used Samsung m31 for two days I am in love with the software as well as its hardware. There's tonnes of features in this OS optimised by Samsung. There's redmi note 8 users in my house and I can tell you that those phones are absolute Sh!t in front of m31. This phone may not come with features like punch hole display, in screen fingerprint sensor but after having used this I don't miss those features. I hate notches on phones but the one on this is great and doesn't disturb the functionality of display. Great phone to buy overall. And bonus : this is not a Chinese spy phone.",0.9705,positive
"  I was one of those guys who ordered this 6/128 gb phone on day one. One of the bad phones Samsung ever made. Even after few software updates, it still restarts on its own, mostly while into a browser and sometimes in other apps. Sometimes, instead of restarting, it turns into a SAMSUNG brick, ie phone will not boot and only Samsung logo keeps on displaying for long. In this condition, you can not restart the phone with power button, you have to use RESET method.  Fortunately, in this case, it only restarts and doesn't get hard reset. Battery lasts for only 4 hours of video, otherwise it's pretty good and lasts for 14-16 hours easily with normal use. Voice from earpiece had started getting deteriorate and I found that the earpiece mesh collects lot of dirt because it sits in a groove, thus vitiating voice quality. It's not waterproof (not claimed too) so if you splash water onto it expect touch to not respond and speaker volume to be extremely low for an hour or two. Though it worked perfectly after three hours of drying after I dropped it once in the water and it got submerged fully for a second or two. Samsung Swipe keyboard is little weird, many times typing wrong words. I can't say more about camera as I don't use it much. Single speaker is not bad for listening music. Fingerprint scanner is not so good, most of the time doesn't recognize. Face recognition is better than that. Still, except for the bricking part, it's a good phone for its look, screen/ resolution and hardware for this price.",0.7794,positive

Thats damm cool.●UI is very smooth and handy.●Screen quality is just awsome.●No heating issue in normal Usage. I have tried 13 apps running in background.(no gaming apps)●Fingerprint reader is fast but face detection is not so fast though its good.Cons:●Cam quality is not up to the mark. It has 64MP, still edge detection is not that perfect. My earlier mobile was Nokia 6.1Plus which has 16MP cam, still I find that better. Hope a soft update can fix this.●I prefer stock android, ANDROID ONE...anyway This UI is also good.● Mobile heats while gamming. This is not a gamming phone. Though I didn't play PUBG or Freefire or CALLofDUTY. Still it heats.. so no question of playing those games.●Charging time is too long and it don't support fast charging. 15w charger in the box and it takes nearly 2 to 3 hrs to charge this phone 0 to 100... I even tried it with Dash Charger(1plus).. still the result is same.. it has long battery so I will not complain about this as I charge it at night.",-0.3447,negative
"  Samsung M31 is wow for its battery. Fingureprint reader is very nice it recognized very quickly, someime I found it's  unresponsive (3times in a 2 month) so used face recognition  or have to use PIN. Camera I like to use 64mp main camera at 3:4. It is amazing in revealing details of close up picture (you can see clearly and  detail of these tiny roof moss/algae, 3.5mm headphone jack was used for size comparison. When I use for scenery photos are good too. Only problem I found is sharpness of photo at highest zoom ( zooming photo to its highest) I think sharpness is good but not best. Samsung should improve processing of photo for excellent shrpness otherwise what  is benefit of giving better lens. I usually use  Adobe lightroom. Last 2 pics were processed in lightroom.  All other camera are  good too. Video quality is very good. All I'm very satisfied for having Samsung M31 phone.",0.9888,positive

"  Not the best phone on the market. can never come close to their flagship phones. So many features are not there. Its like it's made to feel midrange. The camera is horrible. Just take my word for it. When I bought this phone, I read these reviews, and I was like wow these people probably don't know what they're talking about, but yeah it was a late realisation. And of you're a serious photographer, then forgot about this phone. The camera has no pro mode features. It doesn't have manual focus, or shutter speed . Night mode is so gross you're never going to want to use it. The battery was supposed to be amazing, its not. Its just good. Like a 4500 mah battery. If you're looking for a great UI, then I'll have to get your hopes down again. This is not one UI, it on UI core. Which is basically one UI stripped of all it's cool features. Some great alternatives are : Samsung m31s (if you really want Samsung) realme 6, redmi not 9, Poco x2, and Motorola one fusion. You can trust me here I have a lot of smartphone experience...",0.9742,positive
"  I'm reviewing this phone after using it for nearly two months. I bought this phone as a temporary replacement to my flagship. I'm actually very impressed by the price to perfomance ratio of this device. The biggest USP of this phone is its OS. Samsung's OneUI 2.0 has improved tremendously in reducing bloatware and managing RAM efficiently.  It multitasks with ease. The battery life is fantastic. I'm putting my device to charge every alternate day, the screen on time is at least 9-11 hours depending on the intensity of the usage. The Camera quality is great, not outstanding. The speaker is loud and clear. It has Dolby Atmos audio drivers for external audio devices. The call clarity is excellent from both ends. The rear camera does a great job but the front camera doesn't live up to the expectations. It smoothens the images taken from the front cam, not sure if it's because of the sensor or if its in the software. Since it's a budget phone I don't think it would be fair to expect a lot.  I'm not much of a mobile gamer so I never actually tested it in that aspect. The overall build quality is good, looks premium but the entire body is made of plastic. It nearly takes 150 mins to charge to a 100% with the 15W factory charger. The speed doesn't change even if you use a charger of higher capacity. Coming to the conclusion,  I feel this is the best budget phone considering the price and brand value of Samsung. It does its job perfectly and I'll definitely recommend this phone.",0.9911,positive
  For the price this phone has really surprised me in the camera department! The shots come out really good n detailed..the only big disappointment is the processor..even with 6gb ram the phone still feels sluggish like a 3gb ram phone...lags time to time..typing slows down..if you are a really fast typer you might notice it..battery charging speed is decent it fits the price range..display is beautiful..another big plus point..vivid mode on the warmer side gives out nice vibrant colours..speaker is average..I'd suggest you put in a few extra bucks n go for the 8gb variant as more ram will help run the apps smoother and may cause less lag.4/5* for this!,0.9158,positive
"  Simple and straight:Pros:- Battery- Display clarity, bcz it's Amoled and also the size- Enough speed according to it's configuration. Mine is of 6gb RAM- UI, i used Mi before and thought it was the best UI till i started using this. This ONE UI is too good but will let you know about Flaws in ""Cons""- This one for Amazon, i purchased it with exchange of my MI mobile bcz of the recent revolution, u know. The exchange value was very good, thanks to Amazon.Cons:- Fingerprint scanner sometimes is non-responsive, have to use power button to awake screen- There is no multi tasking windows available in this UI- Media volume is not loud enough, Bass lovers can't have enough loudness when playing music- No IR blaster, which is very useful, Samsung should provide atleast in future- No LED indicator for notificationThese are what i observed and mentioned as per my experience, may be useful especially for anyone going purchase or Samsung and for Amazon. Basing on these, you can consider your priority. Cons aren't that big and few can be changed or updated. Finally I recommend for buy. It is a Good Mobile.",0.988,positive
  Good phone but BEWARE....(1) The front facing does not look like it's 32 MP.(2)The BATTERY is NOT NOT NOT good. It drains off in 12 hrs flat heavy use. But even if you use it with ease it doesnt seem to stretch to 24 hrs.SAMSUNG's claims seem to be not correct about battery.,0.0977,positive

Even after 8hrs of use it consumes only  50 to 60 percent of the charge.Camera quality is also good.captures fine details well. The live focus is also quite good. For regular use and daily photography it is beyond sufficient.

"  This is my 4th Samsung mobile device having used different models over the years starting from Wave series.M31 is a definite buy if you are a heavy mobile user where battery, call quality and connectivity is priority.+ Battery has lasted me for more than a complete work day with approx 4hrs of talktime over 50 audio calls over mobile network, 5hrs mix of Microsoft audio call, Google meet audio call, atleast 30-40mins of what's app chatting throughout the day and almost an hr of social media including audio & videos with GPS always ON.Charging is pretty fast.Battery: 10/10+ speed of device which has been brilliant in multi tasking and switching between appsPerformance: 8/10+ support for airtel wifi callingConnectivity: 9/10Camera was never a priority for me however is pretty decent.Camera: 8/10What I didn't like is the bloatware that gets installed from Samsung Galaxy store.

  To all the user who are seeking a mid range phone do not absolutely not buy any Samsung phone. For the first time I bought this M31 Samsung product. And within a month the phone stopped working and I had to visit service centre which took 1 and a half month to rectify my issue that too when I lost my patient and decided to move to Consumer Forum. The most drastic experience I ever had.Now talking about the phone it is simply not worth the dont be fascinated by the add it is not anything like the advertisement.Battery is not fast charging.You take 6 GB or 8 GB after a while you will experience slang and hang up.Camera for name 64 but more equivalent to 12 or 16.Support worst nor the service centre or customer care will do it in time. All you will be getting is harassment . This is my experiences and I will urge and advice all my friends and family do not buy not only this but any Samsung product .,-0.7727,negative

I thought they will replace my phone but I was given a SERVICE REFUND COUPON of ₹17499 which can be redeemed only at a Samsung Store (Not Online).

"  Good thing is that I got the phone delivered withing just 4 hours on the launch date in March 2020.As per suggestion I updated phone immediatelyThe look and feel is nice. Phone quality is good. Also it has AI features in the camera. E.g I can point the phone camera to Text and it can translate, I can point phone to pics, cars etc, and I can information about it.Phone charging is good. It has fast charging, but since battery is 6000 mAH, it takes long time to charge, no complaint about it.However I have experience the phone hanging on the usual applications such as Google Chrome, Internet explorer. The Text box does not open up. I need to close the application and reopen it so that I can type the URL, search criteria of my choice.Once this phone restarted on its own.Also I have experienced that the Mobile data turns off automatically and it does not get on even though in the settings the Mobile data is turned on.Like most of the people I am using Data from JIO which is inserted in SIM1. Today I set the data for SIM 1, no idea how it got selected for SIM2. Please note that I have not opted for Data in the SIM 2 and hence whenever the data from SIM2 is used then heavy charges are applied.Because of these issues I faced giving 3 stars.After 3 months, I experience the hanging once every week.Gets heat up a lot on video calls of WhatsApp, Zoom and Duo calls and restarts automatically.So overall, not recommended.",0.7779,positive
"  Firstly I want to describe the phone's external structure :->the phone is very slim .>Holding the 6000mah battery still it is very light.>but for the people with the short fingers it is hard to access the finger print scanner.The security of the phone:->It gives you the access of finger print scanner. It recognizes and the finger opens the lock very fast.>there is also face scaneer which opens the phone preety fast.>no one can access the phone with out the access of phone passwords.Specs of the camera are the following👇>64 mp rear cam is very good compared relatively to the phones at this price.the pics just awesome you can enjoy them.>the 8 mp ultra wide camera is very good.>the clarity of 5 mp macro camera is very good compared to top end phones.>32 mp front face is so clear that your friends would be jealous of you during the video calls.talking about the display:->the screen is 6.4-inch(16.21 centimeters) Super Amoled - Infinity U Cut Display.>it supports colours over 16 millon.Gaming specs:->while playing the games like pubg ,COD and fortnite it is not the best .>The battery is so good that u could play upto 20 long pubg games in the phone.>You can download fortnite in this this by the help of samsung galaxy store.so it stil good for fortnite users.In this budget this is the best phone over all the phones.",0.992,positive

  Yeah after 15 days of usage..heres my review about samsung galaxy m31PROS1.Amoled display of course the (best in midrange smartphones.)2.camera quality is awesome u must know fully about it and use.(I have attached a couple of shots.)3.Mega battery (lasts one day even if u do 5 hrs of gaming and 2 hrs of watching videos).4.Brand resale value of Samsung.5.Processor is fantastic for everyday usage and good for gaming.6.unexpectedly fingerprint  sensor works so good.CONS1.Stereo speakers are not so loud..they are just aaudible.2.Not a glass back just a polycarbonate body.3.Its an internet model and back covers are not available though im nt a backcover user but i tried finding some in the local market.4.Only two colour options.5.charging takes 2 and half hours to completely charge the device.6.some heating issue when using wifi.FINAL VERDICTThis is an awesome mobile from samsung that competetes with the likes of poco x2 and newly launched moto fusion plus.If u love an perfect brand to buy which gives  regular updates to keep the phone upto date then defintely go for it.😁,0.9896,positive
"  I am using this phone from 7 days and in the seven days I have reviewed it and below are my observations:Unlock speed-Unlock speed using face recognition and fingerprint sensor is really super fast. you will not feel any lag while unlocking the phone it will open it up with just in fraction of a secondCamera -Having 64 MP camera in a budget of this phone is really unexpected you can click eye catching pictures using front and back camera the back camera has 4 sensors which allows you to click macros, depth , Wide Angle and normal pictures in high definition quality.the front camera which is 32 MP allows you to click steady pictures with wide angle for group selfies as wellBattery life and charging -Well, with the battery life I am not that much satisfied as I expected it to be. Having 6000mAh, it lasts for 1 complete day which is good, I liked it. But I thought it will last more longer, but since it has sampled display and 6GB Ram and super fast processor, it takes probably more power. But battery performance will not disappoint you, I used this mobile for Internet surfing, video calls, Netflix and YouTube and it was pretty good. Charging takes time because it has a huge battery in it, so it will take around 3 hours to fully charge it.Performance -Over all, the mobile's performance is really fast with Samsung's own processor and 6gb Ram you will not feel any lag while using this phone and it has latest Android and security patch level so you will always enjoy while using so many apps in the background.Overall summary -In this budget you are getting the features of a 20 to 25 k mobile and Samsung is a reliable brand you can trust on. It's made in India mobile so you can definitely use this mobile without any hassle so go to amazon Amazon Samsung website, buy your mobile, start using it and enjoy!",0.9947,positive
"  Initially, when I got the phone, I encountered the problem during startup, refer to the attached picture but after getting the technical assistance from the Amazon team, I was able to successfully launch my phone and i am not facing any problem after that.Pros:1. The processor is really awesome. I did not see any lag and games like asphalt9, catapult, mortal Kombat, shadow fights are running perfectly fine without any heating issue.2. Battery life is super and working two days in a single charge with heavy usage.3. Camera quality as compared to OnePlus 7 is comparable but OnePlus7 is the winner but considers the cost of OnePlus 7. Overall pictures quality is good.4. Call quality is also good but the speakers are at the bottom so if you're watching videos without headphones, you will struggle with sound as you're fingers might cover the speakers.Cons:1. Battery charging is slow and i think this is due to the fact that battery is 6000 MAH. It takes 4 hours to charge fully.2. It's not coming with a default screen protector so you need to buy it separately and i did not find the good screen protector so far for this phone.Overall this is a fantastic phone with all the good things about it so go for it. I am using 6GB RAM and 128 Gb storage phone.",0.9927,positive
"  I'm satisfied with the overall performance of the mobile. Battery life is excellent. Camera is fine enough and keeps good and clear pictures, provided you hold the phone for a while. Though it is not up to the mark of 64MP. At highest resolution you cannot use the zoom to take the pictures. Sound quality is clear but could be louder. Not a heavy device. Wifi connectivity is fine. Display is superb. Speed is fine but sometimes lagging make you feel that for 8GB RAM it could be better. I connected my 1TB hard drive to it and it had no problems to read it. Transfer of files can be done with OTG pendrive or external Hard drive. Fingerprint reader works fine but face reader is not that sensitive.At the end I would say that with its pros and cons, you may go for it.",0.9625,positive

"  Obverall performance is best. Samsung is Samsung.  Even better than socalled redmi series. Its display and dolby atmos sound is awesome. Main is speaking clarity over call which is supab. Battery life goes upto 2 days even after using it as hotspot device for my smart TV for more than 6 hrs. primary 32 mp camera takes gr8 pics. I won't say rear camera is not good. It is also gr8. But u can't use flash in 64 mp setting.  Fingerprint sensor and face unlock do its job well. Fast charge takes 2 and half hr to full charge from 10%. But I prefer more slow charger as that will increase battery life. And remember it has non removable battery. So why to worry if it takes 4 hrs to full charge. Overall go for it without thinking for alternate.But one problem, seller didn't supply ejection pin with the mobile. I don't want to return as mobile is superb. But seller must check such mistakes before delivery. For someone he may forget to send charger or even mobile.

"  Fingerprint reader is good unless you have sweat on your fingers..... face lock is very accurate.The battery life is awesome and long lasting. It comes with McAfee antivirus preinstalled as inbuilt part of phone settings. The camera quality is somewhat controversial....... the quality of pictures clicked is very good.... the AI of camera is also nice ... only problem faced by me is it doesn't look like its 64 MP..... my mother has one plus 6 and it has 20 MP which I compared and found has equal zoom..... otherwise the quality of capture is far greater than even my sisters one plus 7. I recommend this phone and in this segment ..... samsung has just got everything boosted. The ram us also good..... I have not played very heavy games on it except once I played a 3.5gb role playing game and it was still working fluid. Front camera is also very good and captures really clear pics. Macro camera is also nice. I charge this phone once and use for almost one and a half day without trouble. It's a bit heavy than recent smartphone but it's because its battery is jumbo but the weight is evenly distributed and once in use..... you will never find it a problem. The Dolby sound AI works really great and is only applicable when using earphones or headset. The inbuilt speaker is also loud and clear.

"  Really great phone at a great price. I have been using since two months..runs smoothly without any lag. The best thing is the display. Amazing amoled display with true black which dramatically enhances the user experience and the infinite display is a plus.The camera is quite good. amazing picture quality with a good resolution. Front camera is quite good and convenient for video calls. 64 mp camera, along with wide angled camera are some cool featuresBut it becomes little bad when you zoom.. like water coloring... image processing can be improved. But is acceptable at this price. Dont expect picture quality like that of an iphone or a 30000 plus phone.Battery is good enough for me. As i use it only for calls and browsing and normal regular use like watching movies, YouTube...it gives a decent battery support and lasts upto 1 and  a half day. Not suitable for gaming purpose. Doesn't feel like 6000 mAh. Might be because of the Amoled display as each pixel actively consumes power. Although, black screen uses no power as compared to LCD, still Amoled consumes more power than an average LCD or LED display. Again, battery performance acceptable at this price when compared to the other cool features at this price.Fingerprint sensor works smoothly.And at last, amazing looks and i really like the ocean blue color and the sides are gradually blackened!

You dont really zoom pictures more than your phone's size so why make the hype.About the security, I was concerned previously but as I was already using Google apps so I dont really think this scares me at all.The performance of the phone is really amazing and the reason why is got this phone out of a number of product makes me happy everyday: 2 days battery life on good use.Somewhere I also feel that this phone provides me more features than ios 13.

I really love the camera and inbuilt filters as well.Very easy to operate. No rocket science. Anyone can easily access. Even my 2 years old niece also opens YouTube and photos easily. 🤣😜Very good buy for the price you gave. Prefer it over other brands because of its features and reviews I read before buying.,0.9776,positive
"  I am writing this with my experience of 10 days usage.Battery::I have used many models. Battery wise this is the best mobile I ever used. I use my mobile heavily (personal use, office use, video streaming, net browsing, gaming). For me it is giving 1 full day.Finger Print Scanner::Working accurately but little slow compare to Lenovo and honor mobiles.Camera::Camera is good but not up to the mark. Infact I have a disappointment on this section. Taking too much time to sharpen the picture. Difficult to take children photos. But overall is OKAY... It's camera is good in daylight but in low light conditions picture quality not good.Performance::I give you 5/5 in this section. All previous apps are being saved in memory while your phone put in rest aside. Fast and memory recollection is awesome.",0.9674,positive
"  Amoled display very Sharp and vivid.Battery life excellent ...hardly 30 to 40 percent battery down if you are moderate user and not playing continuous game.OS is smooth.CAMERA need to improve , need to check software upgrades but it's not too bad ,only we need to search for better software.Finger print reader is fast.Go for 6 GB and 128 GB option so no need to worry about space issue.9611 samsung equinox processor works well no lagging observed ( i am also using 1st time this processor ...otherwise I prefer SD processor).Charging require 3 hours to full charge..it is just 15 watts charger but dont worry battery performance is great so hardly need to charge.Samsung really pack monster under 20k ( Best price offered.)Best phone offered by Samsung....go for it👌",0.9856,positive
"  The box wasnt tampered at all, received in good condition. Initially it worked great and works even now, but later found some pretty signifcant heating issues with the device, especially at the top area of the screen, near front camera. Don't know the reason. Also now since last two months I am experiencing some serious screen glicthes which is irritating me now. If you all want a phone of this range, well then i suggest you to put in 2 - 3 k more and buy M51 now.CAMERA works good, wide angle photos are also good, but some details are lost at the borders of the image, the image is automatically colour corrected after each click which is okay but sometimes gets a bit too much, stabilisation isn't really what you would actually like to expect, Just fine, for vloggers any stabilizer or monopod is a must. Selfie camera is also great so heyyaa all selfie geeks, have a good timePROCESSOR is also capable of performing various tasks at same time but I would prefer you to go with SnapDragon processors in the first place.DISPLAY is something Samsung never fails to meet our expectations. AMOLED screen is truly nice, colours are vivid.FINGERPRINT sensor in this mid range phone in my opinion is good. No issues with it, good timing and speed.OVERALL, ok product to be bought at this price but then M51 is  better version of it, so i would prefer you to go with it.",0.9953,positive
  One of the best mobiles I have purchased.Pros: Amazing battery life as it has 6000 mAH battery.Awesome camera. Set it to highest quality if you dont mind space occupied 🙂.Capacity is 64GB which is pretty good.  However you have the option of having a 512 GB microsd Card. I intend to have 128GB card installed so that I can use it as an external drive of sorts 😀. Call quality is good and so is the internet speed handling. All in all very good mobile and I am quite happy using it.,0.9824,positive
"  Pro:1) day battery for heavy use2) big decent screen and weight well distributed3) latest OSCons:1) very slow auto brightness2) no front proximity and light sensor, instead front camera is used for all purpose3) phone gets extra warm while charging4) cell signal not up to the mark5) wifi and mobile data switching is not seamless6) lot of bloatware,.

"  I have purchased this phone in June 2020. Its the best phone in the buget. Having good camera quality, battery life is awesome. Battery lasts upto 2 days. If anyone is thinking of buying a new phone. I suggest to go with this one. I was so impressed by the phone so I have gifted this to my wife and I have purchased another one M21. M21 and M31 both the phones are excellent in budget. I like the themes and wallpaper customization of this phone. Sound is great. From my point I can fully satisfied with the phone and I can rate it full.",0.9828,positive
"  I share some Tech Details.In First Photo, You see Ram in GB.(5.43 + 2.50)(Ram + Swap Memory)Swap memory work same as Ram and its good to see in Samsung. Also it provide you 7.93 GB instead of 6GB.(Maybe Swap memory use for Game boost)In Second Photo, You see the home with 5x6 grid layout.In third Photo, You see Software Details.In fourth, You see black and white photo.(idk what you call)Samsung Camera is good. Samsung also told you which look is good for shot(AI).Samsung M31 is good for gaming + work + Learning(like I learn Reverse Engineering, So need Video tutorials.. instead using pendrive i use my internal storage and super awesome, when your device comes with sAMOLED display.Battery backup is too good(6000 mAh), It something like (kab battery ktam hogi..) i use 52 hrs without puting on charging.Samsung with 6 with 128GB it's really a #MegaMonster.🤪😈",0.9783,positive
"  Overall the phone quality is good ,but I got very much disappointed with the face recognition feature, the phone took plenty of time to unlock the phone. If the light condition in surrounding is good then it unlocks the phone other wise face could not be detected it says. Previously i had lenovo k8 whose camera quality was bad than samsun m31 still even though i tilt my mobile still it could unlock the phone an bad light also it could unlock quickly. So I am thinking that getting a better quality camera phone whichi works worst than less camera quality phone phone.",-0.8367,negative
"  Its been like more then 2 weeks since i am usig this phone with my primary sim.I have been testing all the features and usability this phone offers till this time and now i feel i can give my thoughts about this device.So lets make pointers:-Built: I feel the phone has amazing built Quality. Whereas Yes, the Plastic back won't feel much premium but it is actually much more practical then glass back phones. Yes it can scratch easily but who uses a phone without a cover as i would suggest to get a premium cover to get that premium feeling.Talking about Glass back phones it would be very costly to replace but the plastic shell of m31 would be much more cheaper.-Display: As you already knew its best under 20k segment. Better then other Amoled screen and No Crazy 120hz refresh rate but yeah it feels much better to use.-Software: I was using a stock android device previously and the experience of oneui is actually not bad its smooth and even fun to use. There are some hiccups here and there which is acceptable but one thing is that recent app menu lags alot while switching between apps ruining all the experience.It can be fixed via some software updates.Hardware: Phone is not heavy. The buttons are placed right, good quality buttons gives premium and positive feedback. Fingerprint sensor is fast and accurate too.-Camera: The camera quality is actually very good. All the cameras are quite usefull if you know how to use them. The Wide angle and macro camera is also good but implementation is not that great a software update can fix that too.For the night i can say that the shots are blur and grainy if you can use the camera properly then you can take some amazing shots like i do so for me the night camera is also good not great. Whereas some updates can do improvements to it.-Battery: Best battery life of any phone i have used till now. Yes the charging speed could have been better but the battery life is soo good that you will hardly rush for a charge.Note* first charge heats the device bad but after 2-3 days of usage it gets back to normal nothing to worry about. My device doesn't heatup now.My usage includes all day 2active sims, 50% brightness all day, wifi/data ON 24/7. 2hrs Gaming,1hr youtube,  Some calls, and all day social media.With a usage like this, my phone starting from 100% in the morning to 2nd day evening dropping to 25-30%. I never let my device go below that. Even the stand-by time of the phone is great.-Performance: Its fast and fluid. Whereas the ram management could be Better which can be fixed. No heating issue. Good for normal to heavy gaming. Overall the performance is Very Good of the device.This device is not specified for a single use. Its practically a straight forward device which allows the user to use it as a phone should be used. The phone doesn't offer any hanky panky Stuff for attention making anyone mad for games nor for tiktok.Verdict: If you are a rough user or you travel alot, if you are not a mad gamer then you can go for this device.It offers best practicality and usability thats how a phone should be.",0.9984,positive
"  Samsung m31 has good camera quality,nice processor although it's not game centric but can run pubg at normal setting for 2 + hrs◆Camera is fabulous◆Front camera edge detection is also good◆Handy design◆Amazing weight distribution◆6000mah monster battery goes for 1.5+ day with more than normal usage◆Speakers are so loud and clear◆Supports Dolby atmosphere◆Packing is also niceNote:- I don't realize anything like cons but it's value for money phone ✊😁🔥",0.5081,positive
"  After 1 month usage, here is my review.I had been using Moto for years now but got fed up with not up to date build quality and poor performance. I am also not comfortable with UI that is far from stock android, so didnt give the chinese phones a look. So M31 was my best option.Samsung One UI with Android 10 is an absolute pleasure to navigate.6GB RAM is more than enough with 3.5 GB always available without any apps open.It multi tasks with ease.Screen is AMOLED Full HD and it completely blew your mind as a first time AMOLED user. The difference between AMOLED and normal screen is astounding. Once you get used to it, you won't be able to go back to normal screen. Best Display on a budget phone hands down.I was discouraged by other reviews saying Exynos processor is not good. However I have had no problems with it. Ofcourse if you compare its benchmarks with Snapdragon, it falls behind but that does not make it a bad processor. But trust me, looking at it alone, it is good with no problems. I haven't encountered any stutter or lag till now. Even gaming like Call of Duty and PUBG is perfect with medium settings. Ultra high drops some frames but that is expected of a budget phone. And anyway, gaming experience is perfectly fine on medium settings.Haven't yet tested camera with the lockdown going on but for normal user like me, I found it to be of good quality.Battery is a behemoth and easily lasts 1.5 days with normal usage. with 1-2 hours gaming, I need to charge it only once every morning.Because of battery its slightly on the heavy side but you wont notice because weight distribution is excellent. Feels extremely nice to hold. I strongly recommend getting a cover as the back is glossy and picks up a ton of smudges. That's the only con I experienced.Having used Moto G series and Moto X series in the past, I can safely say this is the best budget smartphone I have brought till date. Phones with specs like this used to cost 30-40k 2 years back. Absolute steal.",0.9967,positive
"  First of all, I consider this phone to be excellent value for money due to high storage capacity, security functions and the quality of the camera. For me, the specs are as good I would expect from much more expensive phones. Another reason is that it is small enough to carry in a pocket. I'm not keen the large screen phones.",0.8515,positive
"  This is my first attempt with Samsung as my alternative phone number. I am a dedicated & loyal iPhone user since beginning but I can confidently say that it was definitely a very good buy. Excellent features, no way behind Apple, great look, back side finger sensor is of great help to easy opening of screen lock. I took some photos , same frames both with my iPhone 11 & Samsung M31. I can definitely say Samsung captured much better snaps in terms of depth, vividness, colour & clarity. Last but not the least , value for money. I must highly recommend.",0.9956,positive
  It takes more time to charge and mobile gets heated up easily . One of the worst products the samsung has manufactured so far. Really upset with the processor and battery life.  More than 3 hours of time it takes to charge up.one day battery. please dont purchase this product guys . Go for A series in samsung. Camera quality  is not as good as A series in Samsung & oppo. Fingerprint reader nice.,-0.4875,negative
"  Best features, Ergonomics: The two best things about the phone are its 6000 mah battery and its weight balance which makes it feel way lighter than its 192 grams. The polycarbonate back means you don't need a case and can use this phone bareback which is nice(just rub down with a damp cloth from time to time to get rid of the fingerprints) A faux leather back would have been better but nothing much to complain about. Battery: On the battery front, the performance is exceptional(7.5 hours on lte and medium brightness, and 13 hours on wifi) and if you switch off the phone and charge, it can charge up from 20% in under 2 hours. Camera: The camera was really bad out of the box but got a massive upgrade in especially low light images after the February patch. Samsung are likely to further improve the camera with updates. One irritation currently is that you can't use the flash and the wide angle at the same time which makes no sense. Performance: Performance is good for day to day tasks especially if you go to the settings and ""reduce animations"" You can also use ram and cache cleaning apps on the playstore to clean your ram and cache with a single click from time to time. Hardware: Gyroscope and compass are there. Samsung used to skimp on these in the past. A macro lens is also available along with the ultrawide. Unfortunately no IR blaster and no zoom lens(depth sensor instead) Also no Samsung Pay or Knox securityDisplay: The display gets better if you tweak it. Out of the box, you get somewhat warm colors. You can also hide the notch the same way as the M30s(look it up on YouTube) Because it is an amoled screen, this works perfectly and you get an uninterrupted display. Overall good experienceSound: The sound of the earphone jack is not punchy but there is no distortion or noise either so good for soft music. You can probably improve the output further with a third party equalizer. The single speaker is clear and reasonably loud. No distortion and good for speech. But not punchy or good for playing music(but then that's what Bluetooth speakers are for)Software: You get Android 10 out of the box. I had heard that some people had trouble with using vpn apps after an Android 10 update but fortunately that's not true. Only software con so far is that a native screen recorder is not a available out of the box(so there may be no way of recording internal audio) Further you can't sideload apps from a third party file explorer. You have to use the built in one. We have to see if it improves with updates. Also you have a screen flash and camera flash feature you can turn on for notifications in the absence of a led notification light Who should buy: People who want the sharpest data capture on their camera and the best gaming performance may look elsewhere, but if you want a reliable rom(I have had files corrupted, especially those on the micro sd card on multiple occasions with MIUI especially during updates), top class battery life, good customer service, and a good quality amoled screen with perfect notch hiding, this is a really good phone. The lack of Samsung Pay is annoying and the main reason for cutting a star. Other things like the older processor were already on the table",0.9908,positive
"  Pros:Amazing Screen QualityOne UISamsung branding and serviceMacro PhotographyCons:Despite 6000mAh, I did not find it to be great. It was just good.Coming from an iPhone, I felt android phones' are way behind in Image processing techniques. Realized that pixel MP values are just to lure people and the real power of a camera lies in the Image processing.Rest everything is normal like every other phone.If you want to buy a Samsung 4GB RAM phone and macro photography doesn't matter for you, go for the M21. But If you are going for a 6GB phone, I would recommend you to spend those extra Rupees and get this M31.",0.7659,positive
"  Overall saying, Samsung M31 works goodPros1. Amazing camera2. Nice screen size and coverage3. Fingerprint sensor is good4. No heating issues5. Speed is quite amazing (you can quickly jump from one app to other, without worrying about hanging issues).6. Soft touch screen which I like mostCons1. Battery life is not as good as expected (you can pull off one day without charge if you spend 60% time of your work hours on phone)2. Face recognizer is extremely poor3. The phone is bit heavy as compared to others I have used so farIn overall terms, i will give 4.5 stars to M31 and I guess it will be a great phone for anyone who wants to try Samsung phone.",0.9405,positive

"  I have been using this phone for over a month now. I need to charge once every two days, which is a major time saver. COnnectivity is good. I used to have connectivity issues with my previous phone, which was a big botheration. There are only areas that I have a bit of a concern. 1. the width of the phone is a bit narrow which, because of my thick fingers creates some typing challenges. 2. I wish the charging cable was 0.5 meter longer.Overall a good phone.",0.802,positive
"  M31 is one of the best mid tier, made in India, ""budget smartphone"" out there right now for people looking for an upgrade from their entry level smartphones. The super AMOLED display, 6000mAh battery, 128 GB storage and a Samsung Exynos processor, that's a little better from the top of the line 600 series Qualcomm Snapdragon line of processors are the strongest selling points. The UI occupies a lot of RAM, 1.8 GB on an average, and the battery performance isn't mind-blowing, it's great 1&1/2 days of usage easily (playing some games, watching YouTube for 3-5 hours), which you'd expect from a 6000mAh battery (I expected a little more). The camera is great, macro shots are well lit and crisp, 64MP main sensor senses colour pretty well, and the wide angle isn't all that great, but it gets the job done, hyperlapse, slomo features are a great addition. Front facing camera is ""okayish"". The phone feels heafty and sturdy to the touch, and feels responsive overall, transitions to background apps are a bit jittery, but I believe it's a UI issue, and not a performance issue. PUBG runs well, if you plan to play casually. Overall, I've been using this phone for over a month now, and I have no major complain. Totally recommend it.",0.9835,positive

Sometimes while I use the camera or watching a video and sometimes while I play the game into it, its screen gets completely black.

If you are using your phone without internet then the battery life works for 3-5 days.• The camera quality of the rear is nice but front cam is not up to that point. It's like you are using front cam with an beauty editor.• As you all know about the screen, it's just awesome.• And other functions of the phone starts properly.Before purchasing this phone. I compared it to many of the smartphones. And trust me this tops at first in this range. So, if your budget is around 15000 u can go for it without any doubt.",0.9847,positive
"  Purchsed one on launch. Had almost made up my mind to buy M30s but saw notification of this M31 being launched so kept my purchase on hold. The features were good at the price. The wait was worthy. Now using almost since 3 months.Truely monster battery. With my use easily lasts bit more than 2 days. Fast charging supported. 50% charged within about 40 min with the provided 9V charger. This is sufficient for a day if one is in hurry to leave for work. By the time one gets ready the phone can be charged 50% almost.Full charge takes about 2.30 hrs. Samsung should have provided a 15 V charger in box as they provide to all the YouTube reviewers. All reviewers spoke of inbox 15W charger.I would have given 5 star rating in all categories then.The finger print scanner occasionally fails to unlock with finger print. Have to press the lock button and unlock again with the finger then. Don't know the reason why this happens.Though I am not a selfie lover or one who keeps on clicking photos often, I found the camera quality good enough, both front and back.Sound quality is ok. Though feel the speaker could have been bit louder.No doubts about Samsung amoled display, it's the best. Samsung being pioneer in this. Very bright even with low settings.Signal reception has no problem.Expandable memory is a good feature we usually do not see now in flagship phones also.Overall good product at this price. Go for it.",0.9741,positive

You just can't compare with 2 yrs back Samsung mid range smartphones.  they were really not value for money. but now situation is different.  the screen is really superb. everything is good except face lock. and the best part is it's a very trustable brand. nowadays privacy is the biggest concern and after hearing about the Xiaomi's case i am not gonna trust any chinese brand. i have poco f1 too but now the situation is different and i will not trust any chinese brand again.

"  Best thing about this Mobile is the BIG Battery & of course the Display is Top Notch.~ For Gaming also mobile fine, some say exynos is not that good vs Snapdragon chipsets but after using for 1st time i would say, not at all disappointed, because see if u can play Pubg in High settings and there not much heat then what else do you need, though there seems to be some lagging issue in higher settings for PUBG Graphics but basic & ultra settings works perfectly 👌.~ No issues with Sims (Airtel/ Jio)~ Best Display i have ever used (AMOLED)~ Sound quality also very good with speaker & also with earphones, atleast way better than my previous mobile (Moto X 4)~6000 Mah BATTERY ❤️ can't beat that with this price seriously 💯 easily works for whole day, on normal use u may get 30% on next day too,My location, Bluetooth, is always on for fitness band so with all these + fb, YouTube, insta , regular browsing, WhatsApp, pubg for 2-3 hours, i still get 25 - 35% at the night or next day morning, this is the best thing about this Mobile (Full Paisa wasoool hai 💯)~ 6gb Ram is quite good- nowadays u need atleast 6gb for smooth working, i haven't seen any hanging issues till now even after rough use believe me~ ONE UI 2.0 : I normally prefer clean stock android phones like Motorola, all my previous phones were from Motorola but u know it sucks now so wanted buy mid range with near clean stock android phone, so this my 1st Samsung Mobile, earlier i never liked Samsung because of there UI, but with ONEUI all is fine u get android 10 with all the Google features.~ Performance is also goodOverall i would definitely recommend this Mobile at this price range (i got this for 15,999)",0.9962,positive
"  I'm using my Samsung Galaxy M31 for more than a month and now reviewing it.Below are the details that I feel and have have experienced during my usage.- sAmoled display: The best display one can get in the price range. It truely give flagship phone like experience in mid price range phone.- Bettery: Single charge works for me for more than 1.5 day almost with 3-4 hours daily calls, 2-3 hours daily live streaming, 24 hours net connected. It gets 15W fast charge which takes almost 3 hours to charge this power house from less than 10% to full charge.- Camera: quad camera setup does it job well. 64MP Primary camera takes decent photos in day light. Live focus also works great. Macro is fine too. Ultra wide mode is also good. Though it has night mode but shows noise. 32 MP front camera is best in this segment.Processor: Exynox 9611 works absolutely fine for day to day life. I'm not a gamer so not sure about gaming performance. Apps open without any issue and don't feel any lag.UI: One UI also gives the best experience. It is very smooth and easy to use.The other good thing about this phone is that Samsung is providing McAfee security in this phone which no one will find in Chinese phones.So if you have the budget of 17-18k for new smart phone and want to get smooth and best experience in this price range, please go ahead and buy this phone. But if you less budget around 14k the go for Galaxy M21 in which one will get tri camera setup instead of quad in M31 and have 64GB internal memory which should also be sufficient and rest of the features list are same as M31.",0.9925,positive

"  A big NO for gamers but simply awesome things are -1. of course the AMOLED Display.2. 6000mAh battery3. Main 64MP Samsung sensor with good image quality.4. wifi calling feature.5. dedicated SD Card slotBut some other facts to consider -1. in Pro mode camera 'shutter speed control' and 'focus control' is missing.2. Volume Rocker and power button are cheap plastic, although it gives good tactile feedback.3. have to very careful through the setup process, otherwise, you will get lots of unwanted notifications.4. you need a good protective cover to prevent scratches.5. Charger cable/Data cable, provided is short.6. u will feel Battery is taking so much juice to compare to snapdragon SoC, because of Exynos 9611 processor. but u 'll get 1.5-2 days of battery for normal usage.... I hope this will help u to decide before buying this phone.",0.9831,positive
"  Writing this review after 1 week of use age:Did extensive research before picking this up on Amazon and felt this phone is value for money in this price segment when compared against other brands which have similar featuresPros:- Premium Design- Easy to handle- Good Cameras ( both front and rear)- Monster Battery- Good RAM/ Memory which helps you store moreCons:- Takes a long time to charge, other than I wasn’t able to come across anything as of now but looking forward to use this mobile for a long time.Thanks Amazon!",0.8096,positive
"  Two times touch screen fully stuck up. I press volume button and switch off button 7 second for rebute as Samsung site instructions ,then only touch screen worked. I want to return the mobile. when I clicked on replace option in Amazon, there is no option to return. Then I called Amazon . Amazon fixed technician visit. August17 th delivered, 19 th fixed visit, I was waiting 19 th in my home. But a rescheduled technician visit after 20 days. So called Amazon , told about too late schedule, and informed mobile camera showing very dim pictures and videos are same condition and youtube videos are same condition.Again they fixed techinican visit 21 st. I was waiting 21 st in home. But again rescheduled message is came for September 09 , I called Amazon , Amazon offered replacement. New mobiles delivered 24th. Delevery boy told to check mobile. He was waiting 10 minutes to check mobiles. 64 mp camera performance as  32 mp camera in night. Day times its 64 mp camera performance better than mi 48 mp camera. 64 mp camera can use in 3:4 ratio only . A major drawback is 64 mp camera have no zoom facilitie.0therthan 64 mp camera In photo mode there have a 4 optios as 3:4, 9:16, 1:1, full. All have zoom facilitie .  Macro camera is working. Mobiles thickness is too heavy so feel size and weight too heavy. Normally I did not need finger print. So I didn't use it. After some days only I can told about battery performance.",0.763,positive
  Nice display and battery backup. Don't expect perfomance. Good for candy crush level games. Processor is old. At this price today's competition you'll get better ones. Let's be honest. Camera is pathetic. No difference between 16 and 64 MP . I am not a 'mobile gamer' since this device can't do much in there. Also lots of bloatware by samsung. Unnecessary waste updates and apps. Only good things is the battery backup and display. Sound not so great. I don't know why they put a Dolby feature. No change in sound in headphones. Its a Dummy . Speaker an average performer.. Fanboys can suck it. No need to spend this much money for the crappy perfomance. I bought it for 17499 for 6 GB 128 GB variety. Body is cheap plastic. One of the worst kind .Glass breaks easily,-0.9208,negative
"  Unlike any other Samsung smartphone this smartphone is most value for money as it has many features while Samsung kept it's price within 20 k.Camera quality at this price is good. However it claims that it has 64 mega pixel what it does it it compile multiple shots to make it 64 mega pixel , let's not dive in technicality, it has good speaker sound, buy a cover as it is very slippery,  u will get only charger and mobile phone in the box.",0.8173,positive
"  So, you decided to purchase the M31, based on its ratings and reviews? Then you must think about the following facts if you want to buy it:1. If you have more money, go for a higher priced phone like A70s. This phone has the features of other phones which are in the price bracket of 18k-22k.2. The battery backup is very good, my phone lasts 3 days on a single charge, with WiFi on all day, 2-3 hours of browsing throughout the day and moderate calling of 1-2 hours per day. However, if you want to exploit the phone by playing games all day long, you have to charge the phone everyday. Games run smooth, but this is not a gaming phone. You should target something in the price bracket of 35k+ for that purpose.3. Phone is sturdy and looks great. Drop it from a height of 2 feet and it will be okay. Spray water on it, and still it will be ok.4. Camera is really good for normal photography including slow mo, fast shutter speed, good colour reproduction, and daytime photography. Night time photography is decent, but don't expect it to perform like a 50k phone. It will produce photos like a 20k phone should.5. Charging time is around 2.5 hours if you are on 0% charge. But it charges very fast to 85%. So, if you start charging it from 40%, it will take around 30-45 minutes to get fully charged.6. Phone does not get hot under any circumstances, does not hand, does not restart.7. Phone display is very bright, even in bright sunlight.8. Phone UI is good, with some bloatware like NETFLIX.9. Headphone is not given with phone.",0.9877,positive
"  After using 1week I am writing this.First, I would like to thanks Amazon for their service, I got the phone before estimated deliver date.Design of the phone is good.Battery is just awesome. With a moderate use it is giving fully two days service.Camera is also awesome in this price range in both day and night mode. But it can't say as 64MP.There is no heating and lagging problem till now.Charging is very fast. But one thing I found as cons, it's network capturing quality is little worse as compared to Vivo mobile phones.  Otherwise it is a quality product. I would like to suggest everybody to go with this phone.",-0.1557,negative
  the samsung M31 -the finger print sensor works great and is sensitive enough .the display of the mobile is very good as compared to the price .i have been using this mobile for 9 days now .the camera  the picture quality is really not good.it comes with tons of preloaded applications and looks like a mess.battery dies in 9 hrs if used continuously.No fast charging as they claims.the length of the lead of the charger is too small .i would suggest to rather buy a Mi mobile which will come cheap from this and will have all the features that this has and 5k less.,0.8687,positive
"  I wonder why a lot of negative comments are there in amazon regarding this phone. I took the risk to buy it even after reading all those negative reviews. And I'm completely satisfied with the device.M31 is a very nice phone with an amazing camera clarity, wonderful display and excellent battery life. I really love it.I've added some images(macro shots) that I'd taken with my M31. For me,  its the perfect one I ever had. I've been using samsung for almost 7 years. Had some hang issues with my old device which is Galaxy J5. But M31 is just wow. If you are in search of a phone with a good camera, lasting battery life, best performance with a well known branding,  don't think twice. Go for it. You can completely trust it, after all its SAMSUNG.❤️👌.",0.9922,positive
"  Shameful performance from the Specs provided.. STAY AWAY FROM SAMSUNG!!!!! FOR AN EXAMPLE, Click the button and the camera and the latest Android version takes 3 seconds to capture a photo. Till then, the subject has moved on.Not to mention, the super subpar performance for everything else.Worst performer, the accellometer. Take 10 seconds, get frustrated, turn the phone aronud, then the vertical mode gets activated.Absolutely ashamed of my purchase. MY FAULT. Not SAMSUNGS. THEY ARE A BUNCH OF PROFITEERING KOREANS, who are looking to close in on the HATE CHINESE funda that has been brought on by the current admin.",-0.9529,negative
  Believe me guys this is the best overall package u can get under 18k i have just brought a 64gb variant from amazon at 16k and trust me guys it exceeded my expectationsFirstly lets talk about the cons or negative points of the phone1. The polycarbonate back is a fingerprint magnet and is quite slippery applying a cover is  Highly reccomended2. The glass on the front is highly fragile and gets easily cracked. So applying a tampered glass is necessary.3. The front camera performs very poor in low light4. The fast charging is enabled by default but the battery backup is around 9hrs but if i disable fast charging i could get around 12 hrs of screen on time again that is a good thing because u can just charge it at night as it takes around 4 and half hours to charge completelyNow lets talk about pros:1. Guys the first u will notice is its display and its amazing its the best u can get under 20k 60hz amoled is  way better than 120 or 90 hz ips lcd panels in realme poco etc the display is equivalent to the one on oneplus 7 so it gives a flagship experience it looks better than punch hole ips lcd displays.2. Camera is just amazing dont look at the reviews on you tube cuz the 64 mp sensor is almost same on every device so u can just edit the images and adjust white bala ce exposure etc and get the same images on all the devicesIn the competition3. Software experience: Trust me guys the software experience on samsung is at next level and u will feel it only when u use it by yourself whether its the music application or even the alarm theme or its the themes collection or the user interface it gives u the flagship level experience and u wont feel u are using a midrange phone as one ui on samsung is highly customizable. Talking about the performance believe me u wont find a bit of difference in real life usage between the snapdragon and exynos 9611 it gives a lag free experience as the one ui 2 is highly optimized and pubg runs on highest setting which u can't run on snapdragon 720g equipped smartphones.If u are planning to buy this smartphone just go for it its better than the competition,0.993,positive

"  Consider Other choices also.Quality 6.4 AMOLED Display in FHD, that is  very comfortable to hold inspite of the mega battery that lasts more than a full day with really heavy usage.Screen on time is easily 13-14 hrs after a full charge ,that takes around 2.5 hrs. So no more worries.Touch sensitivity is very good.speaker volume ,call volume, reception are all adequate.Core UI 2 performs well with android 10 out of box and prompt me to update to latest patch on initial setup.No visible lag in daily use with DDR4 ram and UFS 2.1 memory. Finger print reader is snappy with no delay. Gamers may not find the same level of performance in exynos processor as a snapdragon .Camera performance is good in the daylight.Night mode not good with little enhancements.Wide lens is OK,macro shots are average.Camera software has lot of options to explore. Video recording comes with EIS.selfie also poor.Build quality is not OK considering the plastic back while competitors are offering gorilla glass panel.No notification LED.Network signal is very poor compared to my old lenova.Think twice before buying since only replacement is offered by Amazon.",0.0411,positive

  The Samsung galaxy M31 is the best phone to buy under Rs.20.000 I purchased the samsung brand after gap of 2 years. The phone is worth buying for following reasons.1.Camera quality.(both front and back camera are awesome)2.Fingerpoint reader and face reader works very fast.3.The 6000mah Monster battery works for two days easily even for heavy user4.The super amoled screen in this price range is great.I strongly recommend this phone to all the buyers.Thank you SAMSUNG,0.9432,positive
"  I am using this for more than 6 months. Samsung has really upgraded the software glitches those used to create UI slowness.Pros:1. Camera is best2. Lightweight even after having 6000mAH battery3. Fingerprint sensor is very quick4. Display has wide color range and quite bright5. No software lag6. Best for multitasking7. Blue light filter is really helpful8. The motion stability is pretty useful. It is quite fascination to see that it never feels like the video has ever been shot with the phone holdin in the hands.9. The camera captures images with natural colors, not with punchy color like some other phones do.Cons:1. In Macro mode it is hard to focus on object, but it is rarely used2. Night mode could have been a bit better with grain reduction and with more brightness",0.9446,positive

"  Hi All,Please don't buy this scrap from Samsung.I ordered it on the very first day of the launch and turned out to be a great mistake.The most important feature of any mobile  is making and receiving calls and this phone has problem with that only..All calls irrespective of dailed or received gets disconnected automatically within a minute.When I searched for this problem, found out that there are thousands of people who have the same problem.You can Google it yourself to see the harsh reality.Please don't but this.",-0.194,negative
"  Best device around 16k-17k. Overall 4.2/5.Build quality not good. I mean just nice. If i rate it then 3/5. Actually the back of the device is made with polycarbonate so If it were glass, it would be the best all-rounder device in this budget.Screen just superb. 4.7/5.Camera quality also nice. 4/5.Performance also good. I used Samsung J7 prime for 2 and half years. So i know what is the problem with exynos processor. So there exynos 9611 also good processor for approx 2 years. But then this is behave just a 7k-8k budget device. If there was a Snapdragon 712 or 720G processor, it would definitely be rocking device from SAMSUNG under 20k budget. Okay  but the current performance is really smooth and cool. So 4/5.Fingerprint scanner good but also have face unlock option so no problem for device lock security. Both work fine. 4/5.Battery gives approx a day with medium usage. 4/5But charging time really slow. 6000 mAh battery takes time to getting full charge around 2.5 hours. 3/5. Ok let's talk. I think i covered all the pros and cons. Then you decide that what should you do, buy or not buy. If you ask me then definitely go for it if you watch movie and video with decent gaming. I don't think of any other mobile for watching movies or videos. The screen just AWESOME. That's all.",0.9926,positive

Super Amoled screen is awesome.you will enjoy watching video or browsing.Battery is awesome ..it gives 24 hours of battery backup with full usage once full charged otherwise with moderate usage it gives almost 2 days of battery backup.Charging is quite slow and it takes 3 hours to get fully charged but it is worth for usage of 24 to 36 hours. Camera is also superb with super video UHD recording. By default it comes with 32 Mpixel but user can change to 64Mpixel and click awesome pictures.

Amoleds, as you'd expect!The fingerprint is a bit slow sometimes but is quick to unlock. The responsiveness decreases for a short time if you've just turned the phone on.The software is awesome. The out-of-the-box software is a bit unstable but a recent update fixed it. Clean and shiny interface but with a few apps preinstalled, which can be uninstalled.I don't play much games but I played CoD and what a gameplay it gives... Smooth as butter.

"  I was certain that I will not be buying any Chinese product and unfortunately most of the products within my price range of 15 - 20K are Chinese phones. After doing loads of reviews I bought Samsung M31.Verdict: Build quality is great except the back could be a little harder, Camera quality is good but please do not get misled with 64MP quadra camera as it will make your expectation damn high. Overall wonderful pictures with good clarity but with lower configuration, my S9+ takes better pics. The sound quality is awesome. The screen is super awesome. Games played so far is only Roblox, CoC, and 8-ball pool and they ran perfectly without any lag. The battery ran for straight 2 days with a 100% charge with medium usages. Wifi Connectivity is very good but like any other Samsung phone, the phone network and the internet is a little slaggy. didn't find any heating issues so far.

Same with selfie camera.

"  Thanks for the Samsung( really I'm in song with it) for an all in one mobile set at an effective price. Till date,I am not a big fan of Samsung, as they produced mobiles at a bit expensive rate in comparison to other companies producing the same features at a lower price, but with this product, they completely got above everyone. Have been using it from past 3 days, the mobile amazed me with its battery backup, the camera was too good. While watching videos, it was a colorful and bright experience. I haven't experienced any pause while using applications till now. The finger print sensor is very fast in response. Over all to sum it up, it was a pretty good buy at this price. I suggest fellow buyers to go with 128gb rather than 64gb, as you are getting it, just for an extra 1000.",0.9722,positive

In these mobile features is 6GB Ram so this phone never be hang in any time and in this mobile Internal Storage is 62GB and add in memory.So in my review I'm all the way supporting mobile and their functions and programs and the interesting thing is that is now a day’s mobile or cell phones or water protected in situation of wet or emergency by nature, however cell phone is very useful and super important for each and everyone, through cell phone you can call or message anyone within seconds, so I hope and I wish that in future I'll receive and see later the new innovations.Battery: Battery life is its biggest strength.1. Solid battery life2. Vivid display and One UI is goodCamera: Images from the primary camera display excellent exposure, dynamic range, and color in most lighting conditions, with very few visible artifacts affecting image quality.",0.9951,positive
"  Overall everything  is good at this cost and best phone under 20k.Pros: very good battery life, camera quality, performance,  no issue of heating of phone.Cons:1. Signal reception quality is little less but good. Observed, less speed of data when compared with my other phone with same service provider(jio), in parallel sessions.2. Many well known feature like parallel space for all apps, scheduled reboot, IR  buster is not available.3. Battery charging with provided charger takes almost 4 hours to charge completly, I expected max 1 hour.4. New cool features which I really like.",0.9619,positive
"  Pros--1. SUPER AMOLED DISPLAY  Yes the main purpose to purchase this phone is the display experience if u love to watch YouTube, Movies, Songs, etc. don't think just go for it. The sAMOLED display quality feels you premium which cannot provide by other brands in this price range. Samsung sAMOLED  is excellent compare to other brands sAMOLED.(I.e. realme, etc.)2. 64MP QUAD CAMERA, 32MP FRONT  CAMERA  Camera quality is awesome. It is improved compare to M30s 48mp triple rear, 16mp front camera and gives u more details while clicking pics. But when taking low light photos it performs average, sometimes details are missing and gives u blur photos.Note: Price is 15k not expect too much because other brands also lack in low light photos in this price range.3. 6000mah BATTERY  Battery backup is pretty good because sAMOLED display consumes less battery compare to (IPS)LCD, TFT display. It gives u 1.5 days battery backup which cannot given by 4000mah, 5000mah.4. ONE UI, 6GB RAM  Samsung one ui gives u time to time updates at least 2 yrs and above. It feels u cool compare to miui, realme mi etc. 6gb ram in this price range is just awesome because samsung A series will not provide this in 15k.Cons--1. EXYNOS 9611 OCTA CORE PROCESSOR  Samsung M30s is also come with this processor. Samsung should also upgrade the processor and give at least Qualcomm sd675 or above this time. Exynos 9611 is gud for daily purpose but if u are heavy gamer then it feels u bad. This processor is now outdated this time. Performance of exynos 9611 is similar to sd660 and sd665 which is below than sd675.2. MISSING NFC, SAMSUNG PAY, KNOX  SECURITY  A series provide these features but M series will not which is very disappointed for samsung user. Knox Security is samsung selfmade manufactured feature that's why it should also come in M series.3. BUILD QUALITY  Back side build quality is just plastic so u have to use gud back cover to avoid scratches and any other harm. A series Build quality feels u premium that's why M series are cheaper compare to A series.4. 15 WATT CHARGER  It has massive battery 6000mah but 15 w charger is not sufficient, it takes 2.45hrs to charge the phone 0 to 100%.Samsung should upgrade this and can give atleast 27watt charger this time.Note-1.Samsung always try to save money and this time they also achieve this by these all 4 cons. But in my opinion it is best package in 15k because A series are very expensive if we purchasing for these features.2. If compare to other Chinese brands samsung phones are durable for long term uses and provide many service centers everywhere to resolve issues.",0.8165,positive
"  I bought the phone for the sole purpose of processing power and camera. Processing power is really great and so does the 6000mAh battery. But camera is really disappointing. You expect 64MP AI camera to match the standards but it performs really poor, even worse than my Samsung galaxy A70(2018) with 32MP camera. They should look more closely in building cameras. Phone has lag for some of the heavy apps but it eventually nullify soon you start using it daily. I would say if you are buying this phone for camera then DON'T please",-0.9566,negative
"  It is the best phone in this range. I really got what I wanted in this price range. Camera is far better than any other phone in this range. Specially the 64mp back and 32mp back camera. There are lots of features in camera like slow mo, night mode, super slow mo and many more. Fingerprint is working very nicely. I searched many other phones in this range, I watched many videos and review on different platforms and I found that no other phone is better than this. Performance is also really. Battery(6000mh) is awesome. I charge my this phone only once in whole day. There are so many features in this phone. I like the dark mode of this phone very much. Display is also amazing. This phone is perfect for any work. It is very easy to use its features. Overall this is beast phone in this price range. If you have more money you can go for Samsung A51 also.",0.9882,positive
