  OPPO A5: This is faulty product selling by Amazon. and they have shake hand with the the agent to fool customer.The camera quality of this mobile is worst and regarding this on 3rd day itself i wanted to return the product but Amazon has denied it saying its not their fault and product is not manufactured by them. But if the product is not manufactured by them and the product is faulty then they shall take return of the product and should return my money back. But Amazon executive is not taking the request of return for this product. this is straight away fooling the customer by Amazon.,-0.614,negative
"   So the mobile was delivered to me on 20July,20 & the fingerprint scanner stopped working on 11Aug,20 ie less than a month ai it's within one month of purchase the scanner stopped working & if anyone is concerned I have already tried hard reset, soft reset of the handset but the scanner never worked as you can see in the video attached moreover they are still installing the bloatware eg helo app (as seen in the screen shot) which have been BANNED... by the Indian Government.. its not a small issue.. as they are still not working for the safety of there Indian customer... Thus never going to recommend a oppo mobile to anyone not even entry level & just forget about the high-end series...",-0.8183,negative
"  Guys I got this phone with exchange of my MiA1 only RS. 6200Review giving after using this phone for 15 days.Pros:1. Bettery backup is superb.  I have to charge it alternate days.2. Display is awesome3. Camera quality is good but you must have the knowledge of lighting to take awesome pictures.4. RAM 4gb and ROM 64gb is quite good for normal use5. Face recognition is very fast.Cons:1. Camera is not good for those who don't understand the lighting position. Only those user complain about it.2. Pattern lock is not available, you have to satisfied with face lock or numeric lock.3. Weight around 200gms.Overall a good phone with exchange and it will never disappoint you. Trust me.",0.9491,positive
"  It's a great product to have in this price range. Very sturdy design and comes with very good quality back cover. It really protect the phone when falls down.Camera quality is great outdoor and indoor. Speaker is very very good. Fingerprint scanner and face recognization works excellently.Battery last long, very long but dispit having c-type charger it take bit time to recharge fully. For average use/ non-gaming use it last for almost 2 n half day.Only thing I don't like is the weight of the phone. You feel the weight of the phone after some time specially if you are watching long videos n all.I got it in additional exchange value offer so I it's above the average value for money for me. It comes with one year complete protection so if you have kids in the house definitely buy this product. It has blue light filters do saves your child's eye sights.",0.9474,positive

"  I bought this phone for my parents as a gift, its been a week they haven't got any problem with this device so far from their prospective, great camera quality, and long battery life, great build quality, i highly recommend this phone for basic / average user.one thing This phone steps behind is for No fast charging feature, it would be so great to have such feature, anyway i was aware of this before buying so not an issue. the Other thing is that, this phone can be used as a battery bank for other phone, which is totally useless feature if anyone ask me, you have to buy additional wires for that too. BONUS! ColorOS contains bloatware that CANNOT be disabled (for just this, 1 star from review rating is reduced) I really really! hate to not have control over my phone, this thing actually encourage people towards rooting phone, the specific app I hated most is OPPO app market!! WHY? who use this? gladly i am not the user, my parents seems doesn't care about that.but anyway, Overall OPPO A5 2020 is great value phone for basic daily uses and some average gaming",0.9759,positive

This is the biggest drawbacks of this Phone because even 3000 rs phones comes with led notification indicator,0.8894,positive
"  I exchanged this for my Redmi Note 4. All said and done, I think, I shouldn't have. The Redmi Note (4 or any other version since) is superior in every way - scores over the Oppo in both departments  - hardware and software. I would have bought the new Redmi 9 but it wasn't available for exchange and I wasn't about to pay 4000 more. Besides there is the Redmi 9 and then there is a Redmi Note 9 and both offerings use the Mediatek processor, this time over, if I am not mistaken, instead of the Qualcomm Snapdragon, and it is early days yet - with the reviews. They say some flavors of the Mediatek are doing as well as the Qualcomm Snapdragon, but I can't be sure and you might want to look up the data on that elsewhere - say NDTV gadgets or some such site.The Oppo's operating system ""Color OS"" sucks big time. Among other annoyances the most visible / obvious ones are : you don't get that slider to get past the screen saver, and you have to punch in your security numbers every time - which is a bit of a pain and also they want you to pay them anything in between 24 to a couple of hundred bucks for a new theme, which you can get on other phones for free (or at least I did with Redmi). Who in their right mind will pay for kitschy wallpaper and cheap fonts from when windows was launched in 1985 (you know the type that was included in all kinds of ""banner"" software and then made it's way into software like wordstar? that). Also, from day one, the ""assistive ball"" is missing for me. I would use the assistive ball to take screenshots or the one-touch turn off display button. I tried to reach oppo customer service about it. try as I might, i couldn't call them and then I found an email id and tried to write to them, but they didn't have an answer either. The best they could do is ask me to reset the OS all over again - which of course I am not going to do. It would mean downloading and installing all the apps again. And if it still doesn't correct the problem, I'd have lost all that valuable bandwidth for nothing. Also, it would reset some of the bloatware I got rid off, so painstakingly.  I can always use the system one touch turn off display icon from the tray. But shiver me timbers! if I ever need to reach them about a genuine SOS kinda issue, then what?!The other thing that you miss when moving from the Redmi to this one is the Redmi OS's ""Second Space"" feature. The dual device mode (not the same as dual apps). It's like you have a laptop / PC with two operating systems to choose from only you can switch from one to the other when your phone is still on - fully booted up and while working on one OS. Like an alt + tab on the PC, switch from one ""space"" to the other and back again. Talk to the wife on the one end and exchange whatsapp with the girlfriend on the other (kidding. have neither a wife or a girlfriend! but think about those who do! what fun! yeah? they made a phone for adulterers!).I tried to take a picture of the full moon at night the other evening, and all I got was white light in the frame! Now, the thing has four cameras, with goodness knows how many megapixels and it's been a while since smartphones have been at it - so, you'd think they might have the whole point-and-shoot thing in the bag, wouldn't you? At least don't dissolve a perfectly round moon into Jesus' second coming! Elsewhere I read, the OPPO isn't what you use for night photography, but it takes okay enough pictures during the day. But that's like shortchanging you 50 percent on the cameras. It's like they punched in four holes in the thing and stuck in a few lenses that don't do nothing ever for you, like a cheap Rolex knock-off that sits there on your wrist, but won't tell the time.  I don't use the camera, so I won't complain, but you don't want to buy the Oppo to take pictures then.I had a good mind of returning it and get my money back before the window closes but I don't want to go through the hassle all over again (of buying another phone). It works and I am able to use it to connect to the internet. I can only hope that the thing does not develop any snags going ahead and at least lasts me a few years before I can afford to buy me another phone!so, yeah. underwhelmed. but on the plus side, i knocked Rs. 3500/- off of the marked price, got me a little more space (the old Redmi had 32GB and this one has 64, not that it makes a difference to me. A good chunk is taken away by the OS and leaves about 40 GB available to me for my apps, audio and ebooks) , and also I got me 4gb of RAM. That's a GB more and the good thing about that is I don't have to start the Amazon app again every time I go away googling for the answers to the Amazon quiz. (what? so I cheat! it's not like I have won anything ever or am ever gonna win anything anyway!)",0.9967,positive

I don't use face unlock. SD665 is great budget chipset. Updated to Android 10 but color os is just meh. I mean out for 3gb ram it uses 1.5gb, with some permanent services you are left with 1gb free memory.

Ultra Wide6. 5000mah battery with type C charging (again quite rare at this price point)7. Android 10 update (rare for entry level phones)Cons:1. Ultra wide camera is lackluster2. 10watt charging support only3. L1 certification is only for show as Netflix and Prime do not support the phone for HD streamingIf you are getting it sale then it is quite a good phone, but if not on sale then there are better options out there from Samsung, Realme and Redmi.",0.9035,positive
"  The phone is good in terms of battery life and memory only. Rest nothing is good about it. I received this on 13th August and writing review on 20th August. Here are the issues:1. The camera is very poor. It has too much noise and picture quality isn't good.2. This phone doesn't support direct video calls. That's pathetic.3. Phone gets heat up and the charger heats up more than that. I've shared a screenshot of 43°C but I've noticed the temperature going 45°C. If you are using online meeting apps like zoom, ms teams or Google meet, the heating is little faster. The worse part is that it gets up heated while calling which makes it highly uncomfortable to talk and even hold in hands.4. Whatsapp notifications stuck on the screen for few seconds while watching online videos.5. You can't see YouTube videos more than 480p, sometimes a few videos stream at 720p. Same videos run at 1080p on other devices.6. The customer care executives aren't able to understand the problem. I've called 5 times since Sunday but they conduct and suggest the same solution for better performance of the phone but no improvements have been noticed. Yesterday I was convinced that Amazon has registered the problem and will get back to me but I'm waiting since yesterday afternoon and my query hasn't come yet.7. Amazon fools you. It decreased its prices on 6-7 August for sale. I was happy that this product is available at a lower price but the decreased price has become fixed now. So whenever you see a sale, always buy electronic products after the sale is over and don't become a fool. I bought this item based on my friends recommendations (since I needed a phone urgently for my work) but I'm done buying any electronic products from Amazon.",0.6389,positive
  First impressions - Beautiful ! Design and build - full marks..This is my first Oppo experience. Bought it as a gift for a near one.It has all that you need! I haven't enabled the finger print sensor as its not needed as yet. Touch is as responsive as my OnePlus 6T I use.  Its just 2 days of use. Its just the perfect blend of features and great specs it already has. No lag whatsoever and this is the 3 GB version. No bloatware.What more can one want ? Overall Excellent VFM !,0.9749,positive
"  I had never thought I would go for this phone.I had thought to buy redmi note 9 which went out of stock and I needed a phone urgently.Then finally I had to buy this. It is really amazing. I was not having good opinion about this phone , but its AMAZING.Camera: The rear camera performnace is realy amazing at this price point. Front camera performance is above average. I wouldnt recommend selfie lovers.The video stabalisation of rare camera is like other phone in price segmant like redmi note 8.Battery: The battery is the beast . It lasts a day smoothly after heavy use and may even remiain after that.Performance: Its good . I wouldnt say its bestBut redmi note 9/note 8 is better in smoothness if compared. But its smooth.Pros(my point of view):1. Camera is outstanding for the price2. Speakers are extra loud and have good quality3. Screen is really large and colours pop out amazingly4. Fingerprint and face unlock are like flagship phones5. Design feels rich6. Phone feels light in handCons:1. Front camera could be improved2.the speed of scrolling is a bit slow( Im not sure, i guess it can be fixed through settings)3. Camera app could have more features like night mode",0.9882,positive
"  I am a normal phone user, so dont  like to play game in Phone and waste time.But want to give a honest review1) I have taken White colour Phone and its really looking great. I will suggest dont go for Black.2) Camera Is good total 4+1 Lense are there , Selfie is also good but not up to the mark. but back camera is very good . We should expect DSLR quality from Phone camera so My rating is 4.3) Charging is quite good and fast .4) Company is providing back cover and earphone so it saves Rs.500/- Earphone sound is very good and soft.5) Finger Sensor rating is 46) Using since 24 Hours and not fell any lagging. Installed my Office application and its quit good and Fast.7) Better than MI (Xiomi) because now these days MI comes in Sale and in few minutes it will finish , but I would recommend  for this no need to wait for sale and quite a good phone in this 12000/- range.8) Delivery took less than 24 hours and I am not a prime member- Credit goes to Amazon.Cons1) Ring tone is little bit low",0.9877,positive

"  This phone has one of the best dual speakers available in the market, its loud and clear with dolby atmos.Display is 720 p but its bright and overall picture quality and sound effects are amazing.Processor sd 665 is nice too, you can play pub g and most of the heavy games on it with medium to high settings.Call quality, wifi receiver and every other aspect of this phone is nice for this budget. of 10 to 11 K.Whats not good with this phone is - battery Charging time !!!!!!! it takes 3hrs to charge from 0 to 100 with 10 watt charger. Discharge of battrey is good because of 11nm chipset so kinda helps in number of times you will charge.Canera quality is ok, not the best but does justice to the price.Definitely recommend it to others if you dont mind 2-3 hrs charging time.",0.9806,positive
  The phone is good but in 2020 you can get a better spec with the same budget. It can be any other Oppo or any other brand. But it won't disappoint you. The only bad is it's camera. Not that much good if you are a photoholic person. Otherwise it will satisfy you in every other aspect. Be it battery life or display or sound quality. No heating issue. Fingerprint sensor is excellent. Overall 3.5 star.,0.7951,positive
  Screen -Screen quality is very veryy bad. After 30 minutes of continuously uses i have headache & pain in eye's.Let's talk about the processor -Performance of Snapdragon 665 processor is very bad in this phone even my Redmi note 5 pro which is 2 years old & has Snapdragon 636 processor is perform better in Games especially in PUBG.Camera -Both Cameras are decentGameplay -When i start playing PUBG i experience a huge Lag problem & Continuously frame Drops even in very low Graphics ( So Smooth + Medium ). I wouldn't expect this type of performance.Performance in gaming is very Bad.Other -The pre apllied Screen protector is very bad. It has 0% smoothness.The Sterio Speakers is not that laoud as other smartphone which has Sterio Speakers.Battery -Battery life is ok but not as i expect. But the main problem is charging it takes approximately 2:30 - 3 hours to charge 100%. Charging speed is very slow. If you are in hurry or in emergency belive me this phone is Sucks & get cheated with youDesign -Design is very good but the white colour became dull very easily.Accessories -You get a 10w charger & usb type-C which is of  Poor quality.You only get earphone with 4gb model. with 3 gb model you  can't get earphones.Please Don't wasn't your money Here.

  Oppo A5 2020 is good enough as per budget but operating system needs to be little more upgraded. Phone app/calling app is not user friendly.  It is same like redmi phone app. And gallery media files are arranged in a reverse dated rows means you will find media files like pics/videos from current dates at the bottom and very old dated at the top which is not convenient.  Rest all is fine.,0.813,positive
"  The phone built quality seems good with good finishing. Has a good camera. Audio quality is good. But the screen size is large and can be uncomfortable while riding a bike. Also, the audio jack is on the bottom side,so if you are an avid music listener the cable could bend a lot. For the price I paid I am very happy with the product as I have found the camera and the audio very good. The screen resolution could have been better though for the size of the screen used.

But as it's having sd 665 ai processor I tested it with gameplay of freefire in low settings and device got hanged, with unbearable fluctuating FPS. I changed certain settings in developer options to make more ram free and bang performance of gaming improved drastically. This simply means this device has bad ram management and it really needs to ne worked out. I would suggest if you bare planning to buy this device with multitasking and gaming in mind than think twice, otherwise it's Ok to go for it.",0.816,positive
  I purchased this phone only for Vowifi  calling as call drop was the major concern that too from all network provider in my lane and conditions worsens after entering the house. But Vowifi works inside also... So I purchased it for vowifi. Firstly I got annoyed as I didn't find the vowifi feature (though i checked in internet before purchasing) . But then there was a catch that only oppo 2020 having Color OS 7 have this feature and upgrades will be available for phones having build version ending with 48 and 51. This I came to know from Oppo customer care. Thankfully my phone was in list of updated ones and after updating it serves the purpose. Now I can make and receive calls even inside house. Weight Slightly on higher side but touch and camera are gud.,0.4588,positive
"  I have been using phone almost one month. I am satisfied. This phone is more good that what I have expected. Starting with camera ,it is only a average camera not bad but has 4k video recording. Battery life is excellent. I am getting 11 plus hours ON screen usage. Then the most good part of the phone is it's speakers and finger print scanner. Screen is not full hd only 720p but it's good . Phones design is perfect. In my usage of 1 month I haven't felt any lag even when I played Pubg. I can't find any dark mode on this phone. In my first impression the phone was a bit heavy. But after usng it I am used to it. Overall a good phone for day to day use.",0.9873,positive

"  I have been using this phone for around two weeks and following are the pros and cons I found of this device:Pros1. Battery life is supperb, the HD plus  screen kind off consumes less power than a Full HD screen and hence battery life with a 5000 mah battery is really good.2. Speaker and sound is absolutely best, dolby atmos is amazing to hear, there are two speakers on this phone.3. Quad cameras, there are four of them in the rear and they take decent photos for this price range.4. Android 10 update with dark mode looks awesome along with colorOS 7 UI.5. Display is very good inspite of being only HD plus display.6. Snapdragon 665 can run most games at medium settings without any problem.Cons1. No fast charge, it will take around 2 hours to fully charge this phone to 100% from 10%.2. Screen resolution should have been Full HD and many of the completitors are offering it at this price.3. Front camera not as good as you would expect despite being 8 mp.",0.9611,positive
"  Good quality display even if its a HD+ display, Color OS 7 is a big improvement over its predecessor, UI is customizable according to your taste, Dependable cameras, Goodness of snapdragon 665, good battery backup enough to last throughout the day, also has type-C charging port.Overall a good buy, recent mobile are always out of stock, however this was a very good alternative and dont regret buying it. Its performance is comparable to recently launched moto g9, nokia 5.3, redmi 9 prime, realme narzo.",0.9624,positive
  The phone has a lot of specifications and one of the best phone in this range. The thing which makes it special is its battery and processor. The snapdragon 660 and 5000mah the perfect combination for every normal user. The camera is not good while comparing to the other high end devices but its manageable. Loved this phone it is whole white and looks lavish.,0.8872,positive
  So I bought this phone for my Dad. Initially I had a budget of 12k and I was considering to buy Redmi 9 prime but it sells out almost immediately and offline it costs 2k moreAfter a bit of research I found this phone to be relevant and Cheaper.Performance is smooth as it has sd665 and battery life is great considering hd+ and 5000mah battery.Honestly I don't find a great deal of quality difference in terms of screen resolution as I myself use k20 pro which has FHd+ panel.It comes with Android 9 but it can be updated to Oreo in system updatesFew things which you may dislike are:A lot of crap apps some can be uninstalled and others can't.Camera performance (comparing from k20 pro perspective) is very average4 cameras mostly useless Ultrawide can be of a little use thoughFew things I liked arePlastic build is good and I personally liked itComes with a pretty good back case. Which my Dad is using from starting so it saved 200-300 rupeesType C charging is goodSize is great and light weight too,0.9703,positive
