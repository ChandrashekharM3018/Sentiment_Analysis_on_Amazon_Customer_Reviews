  I have been using it for a week.I came back to samsung after using Redmi note and it feels so much better.The touch and feel iss awesome. Fast an smooth operations with anroid 10. Lots of intelligent features at this price like limiting screen time for each app and winddown function in the night etc.. Camera is decent for normal photo. Sound and speakers are good for clear conversations.The only thing which might be a downside for some people'could be compact size of screen especially if you're used to big screens. It might take some time to get accustomed if you are a frequent movie watcher.Overall it's much better than the so called value for money brands like Redmi Oppo Vivo Realme etc which are primarily winning customers by offering more storage battery and big screen but lack performance.A good to buy phone for  9000,0.9215,positive

"  This mobile has software problem it seems, within 10 days of usage it hangs a lot. Also it has mic problem, when you attend the call the caller at the other end won’t be able to hear you, you need to restart the mobile for couple of time then it works. I can’t use it like this for longer run, please help me to return the product, I will handover the mobile by doing factory reset. Please review and help as soon as possible.",0.7269,positive
"  I bought this for 8990.. Now it has reduced to 8399.. The product is worth the price. Before buying make of the purpose of the usage.. This is a budget phone and is not for gaming.. My dad needed a phone which has decent battery life and whatsapp for official usage.. He doesn't use it for anything else... I wanted to buy only Samsung phone. I finally concluded to buy this..Pros.1. Good battery life.2. Size is not big. Hence easy to carry. (This might be a con for few)3. Doesn't heat while charging/ normal usage. Though few have complained of heating. However I didn't experience any heating issue.4. Low sar. (0.61 W/kg- head). I particularly check for SAR value before buying.5. Doesn't heat on normal usage.  This depends on how u define ""Normal"". The apps my dad use are few banking apps, Whatsapp, YouTube, and for office use6. Smooth UI7. Android 10 with latest security update.8. Good call quality. Even after hours of calling it didn't heat up.Cons.Can't complain about these coz you get what u pay for.. Lack of fingerprint scanner and slow charging are to name a few.. Samsung can include a screen guard too. :)However getting a Samsung phone for this price is really worth.. Samsung= Quality & Reliability.Samsung is an innovative brand. They spend lots of money for R&D to bring out new feature. So when I pay for Samsung Iam paying for innovation. :)I will be buying M31 s in next sale.. Samsung 4ever! :)",0.8777,positive

"  Don't buy any Mobile from Amazon if you are not fully aware abaout the product. After buying they are not entertain you for returning/replacement. Pathetic customer support by customer care service.Very upset from Amazon, they are only making money from India with cheap policies.They are asking to download an waste app in your phone which has 1.8 rating on play store and asking you for permission of  your personal information.And yes this mobile has very cheap quality and only sold due to less option in Indian market. Only samsung mobile left in market if you don't want to buy any Chinese mobile. Not a single Indian mobile available in own Indian market.Samsung making good money with its cheap quality mobile phones.",0.6144,positive
  Not worth the price at all! I am writing the review after using 17 days!Pros.1. Handy piece tho a bit heavy it's good to operate.2. Front camera is cool.3. Good face lock AI.Cons.1. Worst camera ui and I don't think this time samsung has their quality over the camera the back camera is worst.2. Not a worthy battery life.3. Too highly priced.Totally I'm not satisfied!It's better to buy any other model other than this. If not the new realme model is of the same price almost of this and has super good features. You can choose that or any other model from Samsung itself but don't choose this model coz there are lot of flaws in this... so its not worth the price.Hope my review helped..,-0.3093,negative
  This is just to get your job done. don't expect too much .Pros : -** display is good.. no complains.** sound okay** can uninstall bloatware except few samsung specific ones.** very handy. form factor is nice.** Battery easily lasts for 2 days on normal** Samsung One UI is too good.Cons : -1) Camera very big disappointment. Only expect good pics in outdoors under good lighting conditions.2) Charges very slow.3) Having a tough time finding a good coverNote : No tempered glass or headphone will be provided in the box,0.8887,positive
"  I have purchased for my mother. She is learning operating android phone 1st time. The item is handy as the screen size is smaller than ours 6"" phones. On the performance side the set is quite fast. Battery is getting  heated during continuous use. Just a week has passed sonce the phone is in use. Further details may be provided later.",0,positive

"  Samsung M series, great phone in this range all are value money. Let's see here the SAMSUNG M01 phone: red colour , thin design make gives beautiful phone look. It has optimised performance with low power consumption that's gives you longer battery life time. It does not have finger tip sensor, bought it for grand parent who do not actually need it, some time in emergency you don't wish to have these security features.  At this budget with exchange offer got a great deal a brand new phone with loaded feature at 6500, isn't good. Front camera is average, clarity is good however back dual camera is good, inbuilt animated shot can give you different experience. The phone having good voice and sound quality, inbuilt and expendable memories are now improved than older phones gives you the freedom to be entertain. I love the display quality of samsung this is unmatched feature. Phone size is small and compact so can easily carry it in pockets, or keep it with other phone if you keep two phone.If want to have phone at low budget or secondary phone for back- up with reliable brand it's a good choice.ver all it's a great quality branded value for money phone.",0.9937,positive
"  Poor audio quality. Ordered it for my parents but both microphone and speaker volume is poor by designInstead of having the speakers at charging jeck thay have it on the vack side. When call comes no one is able to hear because the phone is keot on its back.Despite of buying via prime fulfilled, Amazon refused to return item.",-0.7227,negative
"  My Personal genuine reviewSamsung Is overcharged for this phone, the brand which most people love in india.Samsung is Overpriced his every Phone in india, using anti China sentiment of Indian people.If you buy this phone remember it will take total 4 Hours to charge Fully😂.Charger is only 5v 1amp.Samsung price 8.5k for this phone and doesn't even satisfy now days criteria.Camera is also Bakwas😂.Resolution quality really you will hate after using because I think it's 480ppi Resolution. Because also have mother HD+ phone which is more clear than this m01.Performance is also not upto the mark.All disadvantages in it.But there is Only one advantage if you also antichina then you get 'Samsung' only 'name' from non Chinese brand.That's only advantage 😂Buy if you want to let samsung use anti china sentiment and let samsung earn more money via overpriced.",-0.7215,negative
  The product is good and worth for the money given. I got it for 6950 after exchanging the old Samsung.Battery life is good even after continuous use . Display and camera are very good.  No lagging.  For a middle income group it will be a good asset . No fingerprint reader.,0.9377,positive
"  Nice, does what it's supposed to do. Dual-sim works well. I use it as a backup phone to my Galaxy Note, and it works well.",0.7184,positive
  One of the best smartphone under 10kI bought one for my dad it works very smooth no lag or hanging issue and it's also surprise me with a gaming review I tried few heavy games and that worked really smooth camera is goodOverall I loved it in this price range thanks  Samsung and Amazon,0.9467,positive
"  Bought this one on 25th August, reviewing on 22nd September.Battery life with a pocket friendly size is the only good thing about this phone! The headphone jack is behaving so erratically...it automatically reduces or increase the volume of audio/video being played and despite pressing hard on the keys or trying different earphones, the problem persists...even after a factory reset.Also, the charging socket has stopped working properly, so now I have to place my phone at a specific angle or keep holding in my hands in that position while charging the phone!Screw you Amazon...7 days replacement policy is just not good enough!",0.7154,positive
"  This mobile was delivered on 23-Jul-2020. After 9 days of use, the volume key and power key is not working. Worst product and services by Samsung and Amazon. No option for replacement. They are distributing defective products. Please refrain from buying this mobile.",0.2946,positive
"  Now this is a great phone for its price point ( under 9k )Battery is great, display is bright, speaker voice is clear ( not the loudest but works 9/10 cases ), Great UI/UX of android, average camera.There are alternatives available of this phone and you can check them out too but you won't be disappointed with this one.Things you will miss -Wifi tech is older - it won't catch the ultra fast wifi networks ( still works well with average wifi connection )Bloatware - a lot of unnecessary apps ( doesn't annoy you but still feels forced )Average camera - works fine for good daylight pics but the focus is slow and is pretty bad in low light.Old charging port - Does not use the type-c standard now and no fast charging.",0.9436,positive
"  This phone is meant for a very small group of people. First of all, it is a very small display compared to other flagship or even other low budget phone . The only reason one should buy this is either they love Samsung ui - android 10 or they need a backup phone with very less radiation. The snapdragon 400 chip set is a very outdated chip which does not provide even close to the performance from other phones from this range. Well , after this you might think that the camera might be great. Wrong again , the 8 mega pixel camera can maximum take photos uptown 4 mp(which is not of even good quality either) and the front facing camera is just trash.Talking about spec sheet, out the the 32 GB, you only get 20. And out 3GB ram , there is only 1.5 GB ram which you can use. Running simple applications take about 2.5 GB ram.Battery is decent(finally something good about the phone) but it will ofcourse be so ,as there has been compromises is every other part of the phone.  In the box comes a 5 watt charger which takes ages. At an age where phones can charge uptown 100 watt, it's totally unfair that samsung gives us 5 watt charger. There is no inbuilt screen protector or back case.The dual camera setup is just for name sake. Please don't buy this phone for the camera or performance.Like I said earlier,  this phone is useful for old grandparents or children with limited usage. With is budget,  you can get better phones such as narzo 10a or oppo phones which are better and give relatively good performance too.The phone doesn't lag much but due to the small screen , online class or videos will be hard to attend. If in case you plan to buy this phone , try contacting a physical store as they can give you a better price. Another problem I noticed, the charging cable is smaller than the normal size. Makes it difficult to charge.",0.9034,positive
"  Superb product, Battery back is very GoodGo for It rather than our ""enemy country's"" products, you know what I'm talking about 🙏",0.1531,positive
  It’s a value product by Samsung at a decent price in less than INR 10K . I personally like the screen size 5.7 better than 6.4 in other M and A series phones. Anyone can go for it! Has got a rich look ! I’m happy with my decision.,0.9401,positive
"  Its a value for money product from Samsung. Though I am not a big Samsung Fan however this model is a superb option when your pocket is tight on budget and you need a good quality smartphone. Phone build quality is sturdy and gives a nice feel in hand and looks good too ,Battery life is good , camera quality is sufficient, screen is good but no fingerprint reader. I really like the screen size (5.7) which is far better that the big phones (6.+ screen size) , because of bit small screen phone fits well in hand and gives the easiness to use with single hand. Samsung should have also provided at least a wired earphone with the phone (should not cost Samsung much) which is missing in the box.",0.9821,positive
"  DISPLAY: The TFT Display quality is good compared to other cheap brands, the viewing angle is also good, does not fade out much when you view it from different angle. Brightness is also sufficient.BATTERY: Battery life is very good. Hours of basic usage (online classes, calls, whatsapp, browsing) and hours of gaming. Using since 15 days, not found unnecessary battery drainage.CHARGING: It's little slow if you are used to a 10W of a fast charging mobile. 1% increment in charge takes 2 minutes and 10-15 seconds approx. But mobile does not heat at all during charging.PERFORMANCE: Zero lag during web browsing, youtube, switching between apps, online classes via skype, zoom & google meet. One UI is really very smooth. I don't play pubg, but it's easily playing games like ""IAF:A cut above"" in ultra graphic settings with no lag or frameskip.CAMERA: The major issue with this mobile is it's camera image quality in low light condition, it's very poor in low light (without flash) but with flash its ok ok type. However the back camera quality in day light or indoor light conditions is good, not soo good or bad, its just good. Selfie camera is not good at all. It needs softwere improvement.CALLS: Call quality is great and loud on both sides.CONCLUSION: If you need a compact, good looking, good in hand feel and durable non-chineese phone with basic to medium usage like online classes, low to medium intensity gaming and smooth ad-free Ui then definitely go for it. However if you want a camera centric phone taking pictures all the day and especially selfies, it's not for you.",0.9722,positive
"  Very cool and decent mobile, as specification smooth touch, good processor, android 10, average camera, less SAR value,  NO heating issue at all. No back cover, no ear phone, charger not modified (old type), no fast charging. At last no signal problem, good buy for Rs 8998.",0.3189,positive
"  Overall it's an average Smartphone.I would tell you about some basic parameters.PERFORMANCE- This Smartphone is having an average Processor. So, don't even think of playing heavy games like COD or PUBG. But if you are buying for normal usage than it works quite well but lags sometime as it has 3GB RAM.CAMERA- It has a decent rear camera. Depth sensor is on average and clicks normal portrait shots. Front camera is below average so don't expect much from it.BATTERY- It has 4000 mAh battery so if you have a normal usage then it works easily for 12-15 hours once it is charged 90%. One problem is that it comes with a 5V/1A Charger so it takes much time to get charged.One more thing is that it doesn't have finger print scanner.It has face unlock that works quite well.At last I would say if you want to buy a non-chinese smartphone and your budget is around 8.5k-9k then you can go for it. This phone is for moderate use and from my view it will easily work for 3-4 years. And if you want gaming or better specs then either you go for Chinese phones or make your budget large.",0.7779,positive
"  The phone is Samsung's offer for those who want a budget phone within 10K. In these Covid times, every person wants a smartphone, but there are not many options, what with many persons not wanting to buy Chinese products. This phone is the answer to them. It has all the features a decent smartphone offers, and is not too heavy on the pocket. I sincerely endorse this product and ask fellow persons to try this.",0.8047,positive

"  I bought this for my aunt. Performance is good actually. I’ve put lots of apps and the speed was good. Speaker is not that loud but for the price it is good. Camera is bad but for people not wanting it, it gets the job done! I’ve also bought M01 core (2GB) which is way inferior compared to this. M01 core’s camera is worse than this. For people using only Facebook, Whatsapp... M01 core would be fine but for a price difference of only ₹1900; M01 offers a lot more!",-0.7256,negative
"  Like : Right now fast access, feather touch key, good camera and picture quality, excellent customer care and remote access of the phone.Dislike: Some important feature like 'Screenshot' is absent in scroll up menu that is to be brought from Accesibility option of setting and put on Assistant menu. Which should be a ready option in scroll up menus. Incoming phone call sound quality was very poor however that was resolved by guidance from Customer care by remote accessing.Battery life which needs to be more longer.",0.9559,positive
"  Post 3 days of usage :Battery - Excellent battery backup (goes up to 2nd day effortlessly - gaming not included in usage).Charging - Fast charging is a miss vs competition brands but while using the device didnt feel it as missing since device sustains entire day smoothly so no probs.Built - Plastic built but from the looks alone it feels good (have a red one) not premium though.The size of the device makes it a superb grip and ease of use with single hand.Display & Touch - Display is small vs  competition. Colour/Brightness is decent enough; no complaints at all. Touch is buttery smooth.OS - Android 10 (though not stock android like Nokia) advantage against competition; very few devices below 10K giving Android10 as out of the box. One would experience it during daily usage.Camera - Worst of the lot i guess; shaky, noisy images and videos (rear and front both) .. it was a shock - Samsung should do something about it in the next s/w update.Except Camera rest the device is very good at the price point!",0.5653,positive
  Phone is good as per this price range with samsung brand value but i have more more expectations,0.3919,positive
"  I am using this phone for more than a week now. I'll try to lay down the pros and cons.Pros:-* Perfect size, best for single hand use and also good enough for watching films and videos.* Battery life is decent, with moderate to slightly heavy usage it easily lasts for a day or more.* Android 10 from the box.* With3gb/32g it functions quite smoothly. No lags whatsoever.* The speaker sound is loud enough and clear.Cons:-* No fingerprint scanner, the face unlock doesn't work well. So you need to depend on pattern or pin unlock.* Doesn't support fast charging, takes around 3.5 hrs for full charge.Some othe points :-* The camera is definitely not the best in the budget but is ok considering the price point.* display isn't amoled but its again decent enough for the price.Finally i would definitely recommend this phone to the ones who are searching for phones in the budget segment with the brand assurance of Samsung and a single hand usable device.",0.9761,positive
  Superrrrb Phone if u are looking for a backup phone for unlimited phone calls and browsing and watching Videos/Live TV.The phone doesnt have a finger print reader but has face recognition option. Face recognition works very well.I bought this one to give my Google Pixel3 a backup ... A backup friend... For my office SIM... as my office calls are endless....morning 9 to evening 8...The best thing about this phone is its size..i wanted small sized screen phone and also light weight ...so i can use it without headphones/earphones..Great Phone in this price range.Battery life is excellent.I am using this phone since last week and found no issues till yet.I am happy to go again with samsung..after a decade.. M01... is a must buy phone ..Trust me... If my wife losses her iphone again..I will gift her M01 in an iphone case😜...Samsung again makes me brand loyal to him..,0.9757,positive
"  You have way better options at this price. This phone is pathetic and its cam is scam, I ll tell you how. when you open cam and open wide angle mode cover one cam out of two. You would realize cam 1 is working, now change the view from wide angle to normal and check by covering cam again only cam1 is working cam 2 is a showpiece. I know how it works because I have other phone with 2 cams.Display avg. Battery is good, No option to do screen mirroring or smart view.Disappointed totally and now cant return...",-0.2732,negative
"  you have lots of options available in that prize, I have order because there was a Replacement guarantee but its only if the phone has fault with it, if you dont like the phone on Design or features you cant change! Amazon wont allow! i was ready for buying Samsung M21 if they were allowing me to change the phone, so be sure before ordering the phone.its a Grandmother style phone!!",0.3495,positive
"  Good budget phone for common people.Overall the phone looks good , at this price 3 gb ram and 32gb space is at best price available. I bought these phone after comparing each model available with 3gb,32gb combination.Features:Value for Money.3GB ram and 32 GB space good enough for daily use.Samsung brand is good as compared to chines phone.Touch sensitivity is good.Not too big in size . can be handled with one hand..Drawbacks:Battery life is okay not great.",0.9247,positive
"  Build quality is really good. I like Samsung Glance app showing news on our interests in the lock screen. My old phone had fingerprint sensor which is missing in M01 but face lock and unlock does the trick and works well. Likewise, I used android one UI in earlier phone. The only feature that i miss is swipe left from home screen to get Google news feed. But then again, its a software feature. My earlier phone was a 16K costing one and still it lasted only 1.5 years and i learnt that since the hynix eMMC used in device hit its lifetime, writes started failing and so phone became unusable. So, I wanted to buy Samsung this time as Samsung eMMC would be more reliable and would last longer. Snapdragon 439 SoC processor is just right enough for regular phone use. Camera still pictures would look super good provided person holds the phone still and even after clicking needs to hold the phone still for couple of seconds or else, the pic appears distorted. Would recommend this phone for sure as it is sturdy and very good value for money.",0.9645,positive
"  No finger printer reader. A handy phone thats of perfect size. Camera is of poor quality  ,doesnt give the 13mp result . Takes more than 3hrs for charging.The product is good when delivered, no faulty packaging or anything as told in other reviews. The charger too gets heated fast. The phone started lagging even aftr the first hour of use(just a 2sec lagged..like it was frozen),then came back.Overall for this Rs 8k its the perfect phoneand better than using any chinese phones.",0.8299,positive
"  No finger print option and phone size would have been 6 inch+.  Now a days competitors supplying the mobiles of matching quality with specified features around same price. In order to retain the existing premier position commanding in mobile segment, hope Samsung focus much to bridge such gaps. Overall it's  a nice experience with this mobile  so far and found to be a good value for money in budget phone segment , for this hard core Motorola user since beginning who opted this  mainly due to its OS with latest android version 10 which enables to  access his company applications supporting only with android 10 and above since 1st October 2020.",0.8807,positive

Battery backup lasts for a day with heavy social media use and light gaming.  Even played COD mobile and PUBG on low settings and the game play was fine.  Charging takes around 4 hours with the in box 5w charger, but can be charged with a 10W charger. Overall a good product where my privacy isn't jeopardized.",0.8216,positive

"  Reviewing the device after using it for more than a week. Find my pros and cons below:Pros:1. Battery: Battery backup is super impressive if you are a normal user. I don't play games but have to take calls through the day as I am working from home and I also use its hotspot throughout the day and the battery doesn't disappoint.2. Camera - I know that this is the new age of triple and quad camera setups in mobile phone but I have to say that even though I had very less expectations from the camera it does a wonderful job. The samsung camera app is superb and even though it has limited features it still performs fabulously in daylight and nicely in artificial or low light.3. One UI- The Samsung's very own android skin is amazingly cool and makes the user experience so much better.4. Display- Even though this is an LCD display still the colours are punchy and even in sunlight the display performs well.5. Biometric- The face unlock performs nicely and unlocks the device in a jiffy.You will not regret the absence of a fingerprint sensor.Cons:1. Charger: As it is a 4000 mAh battery the absence of a fast charger is something that hurts. They could have included the 15 watt adapter that they offer with other devices.2. Case: Though not really a necessity, presence of a protective case would have been so much better.There aren't too many cons as this is a really good device for normal usage and you would be able to use it for all your essential needs for day to day basis.",0.9776,positive
"  Very economical, an excellent phone for this budget.PROS...Since it is Android 10, we can apply dark mode and hence battery consumption is less.Also, even latest apps can be installed in this smartphone due to android 10.3GB Ram provides an excellent working condition to this phone. Even Pubg can be played in this phone without any sort of hang.Massive screen with infinity V display helps to see the online classes and movies very clearly.Dolby atmos provides an excellent utility to this phone. Even with a worthless earbud, by using Dolby atmos, it sounds good.It has a huge battery of 4000mAh and also massive  storage of 32 gb ram, which is worthy for a normal user.LAST but NOT LEAST, I'm very happy to hear that this is an INDIAN smartphone designed by INDIANS. Make in IndiaCONS...Even it has an octa core processor, its processor is very low when compared to redmi and realme phones in this price range.It does not have a fingerprint scanner, but has a fast face unlock.Even though it has a huge battery, it has a 2hrs charging time.So although it has some cons, it is a smartphone with many pros and some cons. I like it very much.What about you ???",0.9611,positive

Wifi connectivity does not work .. phone keeps hanging and there is major lag.. I had already made a complain that the cover was damaged when it was delivered got zero response on that.

"  This phone is another value for money product from the house of Samsung. The following are the things why I like and dislike about  the product:-Pros:1.Battery Life- with 4000mah battery the the battery is powerful for day long intensive use.2. Display-with 5.7 infinity display, the screen the best you can get at this price range.3.Processor- with snapdragon octa core processor the phone is perfect for multi window functions and moderate gaming.4.Android: comes with the latest version of Android 10.5.Memory - comes with 3 gb ram and and 32 gb internal memory with sd card support upto 512 gb which is really good.6. The dark comes looks really cool to me.7. Shape is really nice as it sticks to your palm giving you comfort and I-phone kind of a feeling.Cons:Camera- I must say Samsung fails in a certain way when it comes to camera .Chinese brands are way ahead in this criteria. This is the only thing where Samsung misses out.Overall I give a double thumbs up to this device apart from camera.This is THE PRODUCT product to buy in this  price range if you want to avoid non-chinese product.Also not forget the good after sales service you get from Samsung,they have service centres all over India.",0.964,positive
"  Galaxy M01 comes with pre installed Android 10, which means the user shall have state of the art privacy and security features. Additionally, Samsung's One UI Core 2.0 provides simple user interface which is seamless and attractive.I have been using this phone from last 10 days and faced no issues. All the features are reliable and easy to use.Talking about battery, since I do not use social media and gaming, battery for me lasts for about 2 days after one full charge.You can also hide the navigation keys from the screen and still navigation will be seamless.Another best feature is that you can disable the pre installed Google apps on this phone if you are too concerned about Google collecting your personal data.I haven't used the camera much, so I cannot give review for the camera, but bear in mind that it comes with depth effect.Just one improvement the manufacturers could have maintained is not placing the speakers on the rear panel. The sound doesn't plays clearly when phone is placed on soft surfaces like bed. Some users might not like it.Overall, I find this phone excellent for myself. So, I give it 5 stars.",0.8732,positive

Which I believe, if done outside wouldn't take more then 10 mins. And as per them you have to leave your phone with them for these 4-5 days when they will be ordering and arranging the display.

"  No fingerprint reader, battery life  is satisfactory, once charged  it goes for about 1 to 1.5 days depending on use. User friendly interface but if you're using Samsung for the first time it will take sometime to get used to it as compared to Xiomi and Huawei phones.Also, few android features are missing like it doesn't show network speed, doesn't have additional volume button for only alarm setting and no separate tab for headphone advance settings. Other features , sound and camera is great. Handy and smooth running.",0.4678,positive
