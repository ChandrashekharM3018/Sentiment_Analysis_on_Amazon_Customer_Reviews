Its just a market gimic to clail it monester like features i.e.battery 6000mAH ,15W fast charge ete but reality is far far away from claims.Others features are as per price range but if you thinking for a battery packed phone with fast charge,then I would sugget plz search for others phone in same range.",0.6858,positive

  Even realme performs better.....few issues which concerned me after use were1. When recording slow motion videos...there is  always flicker on screen.2. fingerprint sensor needs more than few attempts to work3. Camera is better than realme but not as good as redmi4. Battery survives one and half day......which is bad because till now I m using it only for WhatsApp and call......I wonder what will happen when I use it for gaming5. Heats when i charge....not expected from a world class company phone6. Mobile data connection vanishes many times in a day...I thought it was my airtel network .....but the same sim works on my old volte phone...without any issue....Suggestions for people who have bought this phone.....Since company does not provides a screen guard..... Please add a screen guard as soon as possible.....because my phone got little scratches ....as I had kept my bike keys and phone in same pocket....I am repenting on not applying screen guard on my phone early...Suggestions for People who have not bought this phone.....If you are low on budget then only select this model ......otherwise go for some other model of Samsung or any other brand.....by adding few more bucks....I am attaching two videos one in normal mode.....second in slow mode.....both videos are made by m21......you can see the flikr effect in second video easily..,-0.5437,negative

Good thing is that they kept the price low.Just got it delivered today. So far so good, many users compalined about battery, charging speed, display issues on m30s.

  Worst phone of my life I have ever purchase . Due to this pandemic situation and blaming china for this corona virus I have decided to purchase a korian company phone . But I broke up my trust . Battery life is poor as it's shows 6000Mah but performance wise it's behave like 4000Mah. Bcuz it's drain so quickly processor is very slow it's hang up in 5 minute and heat like u can make your veggie on this even it's can burn ur ears finger print is not responding I have washed my hand many time but it's not ready to recognize it's. Finally my humble request to amazon pls return this I have made a big mistake to purchase it. Pls help me to return it,0.8636,positive
  A nice looking phone.Light weight because of the plastic body. Performance is pretty good.But it doesn't feel like a 6000 mAh battery. Probably a little shy of that figure. It Drains relatively quickly than what is expected of a 6000 mAh capacity.But overall a product worth it's price. Probably not good for high performance gaming.But expect it to be durable with a low-medium usage.,0.3973,positive
  Samsung Co. Claims that Samsung M21 has fast charging facility and It has 6000 mAh battery but these two claims are totally bogus because I've purchased Samsung M21 and received my order yesterday after using this phone I plugged in charger for charging it took approximate 9 hours to charge the Mobile phone and after full charging approximate 2 hours the Mobile phone battery get reduced 50%. I'm totally disappointed with this phone.,-0.6798,negative

"  I bought the Raven Black, 4GB-64GB variant of the Samsung Galaxy M21 for my mother. I'm impressed with the phone's overall usability. Since my mother is not a heavy user unlike me, I decided to go for Samsung by considering the brand value and overall specs of the phone. The main requirements for my mom are- Good display for media consumption, good battery life and a clean and easy to use UI without any unnecessary ads. Since the Galaxy M21 ticks all the right boxes I decided to go for this phone. Moreover my mother was using a Samsung Mobile prior to this and hence she was accustomed with the functionality of the UI.-The display of the phone is brilliant and at par with the Amoled display of my Redmi K20 Pro.-The battery life is also very good and it easily gives 1.5 days backup even under heavy usage. The only complain I have is the length of the charging cable which is very short.- The performance is good too for day to day usage. The Exynos 9511 is fairly capable and I haven't seen any stutter or lag in UI. If you are ahardcore gamer than I would recommend to look for alternative since it would not perform as good as its competition in regards to gaming. For casual gamers it will do the job well.-The cameras on this phone are brilliant with very good image processing done by Samsung. It takes pictures with natural colours.- The speaker output is average. Its loud enough but the sound produced is nothing impressive since it lacks bass and that clarity in the sound output.- The audio output via the 3.5mm Jack is very good as it supports Dolby Atmos.- The fingerprint sensor is very fast but the face unlock feature is not that consistent as it sometimes fails to read your face.Hence, overall it is a great value package from Samsung and I would highly recommend this phone to everyone looking for a good phone at this price point unless he/she is a heavy gamer. Thanks for reading.Update: After the Software update on 17 June the face unlock feature got extremely fast and accurate.üòÄ",0.9927,positive
"  I am writing this review after one-week use of Samsung Galaxy M21.The only good point is amazing Samsung one UI 2.0 and sAMOLED displayThe issues I faced are1. Super Slow Camera: It is taking 2-4 sec to capture the photo with 48 MP camera2. Heating issue: Many time with normal using I observed some heating on the top of the backside3. Poor Network Antenna: I was using MOTOROLA in the same area and receiving a better signal (latency few milliseconds) as compared to Galaxy M21 (Latency and signal strength are quite low in same ISP).4. Big Battery but Worst Performance: Battery backup is not satisfactory and only a little better than 3400 mAh with Snapdragon SoC based phone. Additionally, it is taking a huge amount of time for charging.Among all these issues I believe it is an average deal under 13k",0.5498,positive

  1. I bought this to gift it to my dear one but I am shocked to see the camera quality of this phone is like 1 mb. I tried all the modes but it enhances the photo brightness automatically and and the photo becomes like a cartoon.2. Tried installing other camera apps but still the quality is poor.3. Tried options for returning but found that there is no option for that.4. Spoke to customer care and they say that they can only replace if the product is damaged and no option for quality related issues. I said that I am ready to buy any other product too. But no response from them.It‚Äôs better to buy from local store than going behind Amazon.,0.8979,positive
"  I like the camera quality, screen sensitivity,  and browsing experience. The speed is excellent.I don't like it's sound. The speaker is not the best, sometimes when I put on loud speaker the person I am speaking to will complain they cannot hear me. Plus when I play music the sound is not the best. Also, the phone does not come with original earphones so you have to hustle for that. Lastly it will take 3 hours to charge and still the battery will only last for 24hours.",-0.813,negative

"  There are some strong point which will force you to buy this phone.1. One UI 2.0 - I would say Samsung's UI is the best experience you can ever feel in any budget phone. This is the strongest point which no youtuber will tell you ever.2. Screen - none other brand offers this quality of screen in their phone of same budget. A user's first priority is screen because 24/7 he/she just need to see on the screen, no metter whatever thing is he using in his phone.Camera- daylight shots are amazing as all the Samsung's phone do. Color contrast is and image processing is better then redmi note 9 pro and realme 6 which is rs1300 more. but night shots are not as good as other brands give.Battery- after 2hrs pubg and regular social media usage you can enjoy this phone from morning 7am to evening 12pm.Charging speed is very slow. It took 2hrs and 30 mins to fully charge.Performance- No doubt Exynos 9611 is not as good as sd720g or helioG90t. But in daily task you will not face any lag on this phone.For pubg gamer-you will notice lag in high resolution gaming but if you want to play without lag then obviously you have to play in Smooth+Ultra it will give you a best performance without any issue.",0.9701,positive
  What can I say just after 30 min.of recieving this phone I applied for return my money. Before this phone I already have 2 phone of Samsung's working good but this phone made in India is hot like a oven.I can't take it near my ears .I have to use ear phone.I call customer care they give me different different idea but problem remain same.I don't give advice to buy this product to any one be careful.,0.7814,positive

"  I have previously purchased m30s but the the signal strength was very weak so I had to to sell the phone on OLX . Apart from the signal strength the phone was awesome I had used Nokia 1 and the internet was superfast by using the same sim card. I suppose Samsung reduces the signal strength in order to reduce the SAR rating. I understand that SAR rating is harmful to our body and brain but Nokia is far excellent in terms of signal strength.Samsung phones are excellent in terms of providing good specifications in budget. Now coming to this phone camera is good, touch responsiveness is excellent, it is having Wi-Fi calling which was not mentioned on the comparison websites such has 91Mobiles neither on the specifications on any otyer website. So M21 is having all the features as comparison to m30s.M21 is having Gorilla Glass which m30s lacksM21 is having Android 10 version As compared to Android 9 of m30s but m30s can be upgraded to Android 10, 11This phone lacks NFC which is present in A30s  A50sBattery is 6000 mah but Nokia phones having the same processor, screen size with 3500 MH batteries are running the same duration as this phone. So 6000 image battery is just a marketing gimmick.Charging even using the type C fast charger takes up to 4 hours for full charge. Battery lasts for one day after heavy usage.Pros:Super amoled screen6000 MaH batteryCons:Signal strength is very poor.(You will have to wait for almost a year to download an app)Since I watch internet TV so I rely on the hotspot (signal strength) in order to buffer the web series movies etc",0.9921,positive

"  The phone is simply amazing. The Raven Black model looks gorgeous. Very sturdy. The camera quality is excellent. The UI is user friendly.

"  At this cost, the phone looks premium. For folks who like a premium looking phone not the fancy looking phone, this is the best at this price segment. all other products at this price bracket consist of fancy and decorated back which may not be the cup of tea for a section of people for whom simple and plain is the premium.

Fingerprint reader is very fast.  Elegant design and wonderful display. The user interface is also very good.  Only difficulties I faced was to find app lock and split screen.

"  So, here it is after using it for more than a month. this phone has a lot of impressive features but lacks a bit of punch when it comes to processing power.My usage is mostly for calling, whatsapp, and video viewing, i don't use much of social media apps and not into too much gaming as well. Still this phone manages to freeze even with just one app running it can be just the chrome browser. Here is summary of what i observed  - Samsung one ui comes with lot of annoying advertisement and notifications, i suspect these galaxy app hog cpu in the background  - Privacy is a huge concern specially with discover feature  - For those who are accustomed to having google news feed by swiping right on home screen, you will find it missing in this phone  - Phone freezes a lot, typical workaround for me is to lock it and wait for a minute unlock and it works  - Wide angle camera shots are really good  - camera quality is nice as well  - battery life is  great, i am charging every two days instead of daily night  - look and finish a not extra-ordinary but are not bad as well  - Does not allow you to restore from google backup on start which is a headache on setting it up, it does come with samsung switch app but that would just install app and cannot restore login and data like google restoreverdict=====Buy this if you are ok with advertisements (i guess same is true with mi, realme etc) from samsung, not too much into heavy usage like gaming etc.Edit 1====phone freeze issue reduced by a lot by removing external sd card. Browser does freeze sometimes but the frequency is a lot lessSamung ui misses user friendly sms/call blocking, you have to select individual message sender details and then block which is a headache and can be improved",0.9842,positive

"  Everyone is removing Chinese products from their life and hence I also planned to throw Xiaomi from my gadget and start using Samsung from now onwards. I further thought to convince my friends & relatives to use Samsung gadgets instead of Xiaomi. But after purchasing Samsung Galaxy M21 from Amazon which was delivered on 30-05-2020, my whole enthusiasm went in trash and I am helpless to compare it with my last handset Redmi 8 which was valued just Rs. 7,999/- as compared to Rs. 12,699/- of Samsung Galaxy M21. I don‚Äôt want to compare Samsung with Xiaomi handsets, but now realize how Xiaomi has captured Indian market in short span of time, surely because of quality & performance of their gadgets.I am trying Amazon customer care since 01-06-2020, but unable to connect and no response from their side. Below are serious issues found in just 2-3 days of using Samsung Galaxy M21 :‚Ä¢ While using wi-fi calling feature, outgoing calls & receiving of SMS gets completely barred‚Ä¢ While using wi-fi, HD call gets stopped‚Ä¢ Whole battery gets drain in just 6-7 hours, not upto 6000 mAh handset performance.‚Ä¢ Fingerprint sensor is very weak, it takes 3-4 times for login‚Ä¢ Dual apps feature is limited for few applications only‚Ä¢ Voice recording feature needs improvementPlease support in getting this issue resolved at the earliest.",0.9474,positive

"  Before I go into details, let me admit that I was a staunch ""hater"" of Samsung Android phones, specially in the low mid range. The first and last Samsung phone I used was a Galaxy Core, back in 2012. I absolutely hated it, and promised to never buy a Samsung phone ever. But then there was an ad and I purchased this M21.. Samsung again, after 8 years. And during these 8 years, I have used Sony Xperia, Moto G, Redmi 4, Redmi Note 7 Pro. So my review is actually a comparison of those phones with this beast.The major advantage of this phone, compared to my Moto G, is the brilliant sAmoled display with Full HD resolution (not 720p, thank God).Processor is so optimised for this phone that it works like a breeze and stays cool like, unlike my both Redmi's. I dont bother the fact that its not a Snapdragon. Performance and usability is so much optimised that you shall never complain.Battery backup is a perfect two day affair, for more than normal usage. Screen on time is excellent. I can easily go through 2 days even after streaming web series and talking a lot on phone calls.The only thing that bothered me is the finger print sensor. Its not a feather touch one, definitely. But it still works pretty good, once you put your finger on inlt properly.For me, its a very good deal under 15k. Would recommend this to anyone, even when blind folded!",0.9947,positive
"  Samsung galaxy m21 (I'm having 4gb ram variant) is a excellent phone in this price segment.Pros:1. Best display under 20k2. Great audio quality via headphones jack (supports dolby audio which is obviously a gimmick but this phone has high res support hence if you have Poweramp you would get maximum quality performance from it.) and has a loud output from loud speaker.3. Excellent battery life (for heavy use easily getting SOT more than 8 hours)4. Great for watching movies supports for FHD+ playback in ott.5. Good performance, not stutters or lag I have noticed (I usually dont keep more than 3 apps in background when in not use).6. Games don't lag or have frame drops if I have moderate graphics. (Even pubg runs great in smooth and extreme settings).7. Samsung One UI is the best next to stock Android (Oxygen os, stock android no big difference except few additional features in Oxygen os). Also comes with Android 10 out of the box.8. Decent camera quality both front and back.9. Unlike previous m series phones this one comes with Corning Gorilla glass 3 and I haven't applied any screen protection and have no scratches till nowü§ûü§ûü§û10. Multitasking is the best feature in this phone. Pop up view mode is a excellent festures. Helps to play games listening to music in youtube or other apps, text messages, browse web simultaneously with this large display.Cons :1. Plastic back can easily get scratched can be avoided using a case.2. Could have added 18W fast charging capabilities takes 2-2.5hours to fully charge (from 15 or 20% to 100).3. Not for gamers who expect high graphics. But recommend for casual gamers or gamers who would be okay to play in moderate graphics.4. Worst camera quality in night mode. Night mode photos are totally unusable. (Samsung may fix this issue with software update if they work on this issue)Conclusion:Don't know why many are complaining about poor battery life or heating issue or games totally unplayable complaints. Dont spread false informations.I haven't faced these issue, even in heavy useage.Buy this phone if you want a all-rounder phone which ticks every boxes.Fyi,Like all other phones in this price segment, even Samsung pushes ads, but here during initial setup of the phone it ask if we would opt for recommendations. If we opt out we wont get any ads and recommendations.üëçüëçüëç",0.9954,positive

"  Guess it was a problem with the seller, and not the product. The seller just delivered a used product with loads of defects. The camera was not functioning, the torch was not functioning and there could be more defects. I was just checking the item the moment it was delivered and encountered with these two defects. Upon unboxing, I found that the phone had a tempered glass already fitted to it. Initially I overlooked this but later realized that someone who had purchased it invested on the glass (and may have used it for a couple of days) with the defects before finally rejecting it.

"  galaxy m21 review:-first of all, it's a very similar device to the galaxy m30s galaxy a50s and galaxy a51 in terms of internal you can't tell the difference between galaxy m30s and m21 in just looking at it. there are some differences between the two devices but not a lot.good:-Display:- so this is the main feature of this phone a full HD super AMOLED display on a 14000 rupees phone is very rear and this the differentiating feature of this device, which include lots of feature of own it's own such as always on true notch hiding and some battery-saving features so it doesn't have the on-screen fingerprint sensor which frankly speaking a good thing because Samsung's in-screen fingerprint sensor is bad really bad it's that bad you  prefer not to use it, and it's fingerprint also have swipe gestures for the notifications which work all the time unlike it's the in-display fingerprint sensor.Software:- software is also really good and it has some neat feature too like the system-wide dark mode which saves battery on the AMOLED screen's and clean and well thought out layout for the one-handed use a good if not great out of the box launcher with few customizations, unlike some Chinese OEM's software, hex installer, and the good lock is absent which is a big bummer for the customization freaks and overall it's nicer UI than most of the Chinese ones and one thing more it also supports android 10's stock navigation gestures which are a heck of a lot better than MIUI's.battery:- it's a full day battery comfortably with all the necessary sensors on the auto-brightness and vibration both of which disabled out of the box for some reason ""because Samsung thinks we are a fool"" it's a 6000 MAH battery if this type capacity would provide another phone my be it was juice it out little longer than this phone does.camera :- this is very strange camera in default camera app shoots very saturated photo and the video is good honestly quite good for the price in day light in nights this phone just falls apart very easily, and wide angle camera is fixed focus which is a good thing or bad thing I don't know, I use it very occasionally and I I am surprised to see that AR doodle and AR emoji is present In it's camera app which is nice bonus.Bad or desired thingBuilt quality:- it's a have a plastic back with a plastic frame means it's a plastic phone and have plastic's quirks like despite having a 6000 mAh battery, it feels light, relatively thin and more ergonomic, it's a plastic, plastic materials are more prone to be scratched but it more durable than glass, if tap on the back around the camera it creates hollow sound so built quality is not on par with the competition.performance: - performance leaves a bit desired because it handles everyday stuff like WhatsApp Instagram and other productivity Apps quite smoothly and in games, it's fall flat in front of the competition and in the 4gb variant 2GB of memory is occupied by the system already so ram Management is an issue in this device, and the stupid battery optimization is killing all the third-party apps in the background some of the like the music app suddenly stops playing song after 1 hrs, you have to disable the battery optimization from the setting in each app you use in the background all the time.Bloat & Ads:- it has all the Microsoft suits preloaded and be careful when you set up the device at the start don't select the option ad recommendation option. even after that my galaxy apps constantly send the spammy notification.so it worth 14000? In my use case yes! I am not a heavy user I don't play heavy games on my phone, for the heavy users, there are lots of better offerings on the online market!",0.9962,positive

Pls do not take third opinions who claim that Exynos processor is lame (which is a false claim of knowledge). I can't say if it is bad or awesome, but it is definitely Decent! You can play Smooth+Extreme or Balanced+Ultra without any issue. Even if you do full and heavy usage for 12 hours continiously, battery is sufficient and fast charging works too.

Didn't try Cod, i usually dont play, Pubg lite plays fine with smooth extreme option only.

Depth camera is really cute, you must experience it to believe. Corrila glass doing its part perfectly. No scraches even after rough one month usage. Screen resolution in amazing; Super Amoled is really superb. Finger print senson is fast (even less than a second)Cons: Apart from depth camera all other cameras are not upto the mark.

"  For those who are still using old Galaxy phones like the Galaxy J2, I think the Galaxy M21 would make logical sense.Samsung Galaxy M21: Although the phone excels on many fronts, my two favorite features remain the battery life and the quality of the display.A few months back, Samsung successfully made big-battery smartphones accessible with its M-series. But the mid-range is a tough segment to crack with the competition from the likes of Xiaomi and Realme. But Samsung knows how critical this segment is right now, given the current situation where consumers are more price-sensitive than ever. For these uncertain times, the new Galaxy M21 makes a lot of sense. Here‚Äôs a closer look at what it‚Äôs been like to use the Galaxy M21 over the past week.Samsung Galaxy M21 specifications: 6.4-inch FHD+ SAMOLED display|Exynos 9611 processor, 4GB/6GB RAM or 64GB/128GB storage|48MP main camera+5MP depth and 8MP ultra wide angle|6000mAh batery|20MP front camera|188grams, 8.9mm thick|Android 10, OneUI 2.0Samsung doesn‚Äôt try to be different with the Galaxy M21, and that‚Äôs just fine. Let me be clear: I don‚Äôt have too many things to say about the Galaxy M21 because the phone looks exactly like the Galaxy M31. So, the Galaxy M21 has a polycarbonate back like the Galaxy M31. Some people may not find it interesting but it never felt like using a cheap plastic phone.For a phone with a 6000mAh battery, the design and build seem perfect. I also liked the fact that the phone doesn‚Äôt feel heavy or bulky, considering the massive battery inside the device. However, I do feel the Galaxy M-series phones have become a bit too dull in terms of design. To be frank, none of this matters to a user who is coming from the Galaxy J-series or any older generation Samsung phone.Although the phone excels on many fronts, my two favorite features remain the battery life and the quality of the display. The 6,000mAh battery in the Galaxy M21 goes on and on. It managed to last one and a half days with my standard usage pattern, which includes browsing the web, listening to Spotify, emails, checking Facebook and Twitter, and light gaming. Since the phone‚Äôs battery lasts for so long, you don‚Äôt want to worry about taking the charger with you. A quick-charge with the charger fills the phone‚Äôs battery in minutes.Another aspect of the M21 that I liked the most is the display. This is a big phone with a 6.4-inch Full HD+ display. And since the phone uses an AMOLED display, the contrast level is great and the black levels are absolute. Even though a lot of mid-range phones these days offer AMOLED displays, the ones made by Samsung have better displays somehow. I found the screen absolutely fine for reading eBooks, watching YouTube, and web browsing. By the way, the small U-shaped notch doesn‚Äôt annoy me anymore. It did annoy me a lot at the beginning but it soon becomes a part of the scenery.Speaking of performance, the Galaxy M21 is powered by the same Exynos 9611 chipset that you find on the Galaxy M31. Samsung has used this processor on many of its mid-range phones and going by my testing, the chipset gets the job done. I was able to open all of the popular apps like Facebook, Twitter, and TikTok on the device without any issues. But don‚Äôt try to run too many heavy games that could slow down the performance. The phone runs on Android 10, and Samsung has done a good job with OneUI 2.0. My review unit had 4GB RAM and 64GB of storage.You won‚Äôt get a great camera system, and that‚Äôs one area where I think the phone falls flat. You get a 48MP primary camera sensor alongside an 8MP ultra-wide camera and a 5MP depth camera. The 48MP main sensor is a hit and miss. Sometimes the photos look great and other times the photos come out of focus. That‚Äôs not to say the camera is bad, it is just not consistent. The Galaxy M21 takes bright shots but in some cases, images lack richness. Even though the phone lets you take ultra-wide angle shots or bokeh shots I wasn‚Äôt too impressed. In comparison to the Galaxy M31, the Galaxy M21 pales in the camera department. For a change, though, the Galaxy M21‚Äôs 20MP front-camera surprisingly worked well both indoors and outdoors.The Galaxy M21 performs similarly to the Galaxy M31. I mean, both phones have a 6000mAh battery, identical processors and displays, and even the design is the same. What the Galaxy M21 noticeably lacks, however, is a camera that‚Äôs not at par to the Galaxy M31. Still, there‚Äôs a lot to love about the Galaxy M21. For those who are still using old Galaxy phones like the Galaxy J2, I think the Galaxy M21 would make logical sense.",0.9974,positive

  ¬†After reading a lot of reviews regarding network issues of the M31 and M21 I was a bit skeptical to buy the M21. I was using Huawei honor phones until now because of their excellent call quality and network reception. After using the Honor 6x and Honor Play I was thinking of buying the Honor 9x pro but after I found out that it did not support Google Play I opted out. So then I began researching other brands and I came across the Galaxy M21. The features were promising but the negative reviews regarding network held me back. By chance I happened to come across a video in YouTube regarding LTE / 3g / 2g settings in the M21. Bingo! I knew where the problem was. So without waiting any longer I ordered this smartphone.After receiving it and using it for a few days I am glad my decision was correct. In fact the call quality and  network reception of the M21is much better than the Honor phones which I have been using for a long time.The reason why this network issue arises is because after inserting the Sim and starting the M21 the OS of this phone selects the LTE/3G/2G (auto connect) option in Mobile networks by default. I am using Jio Sim and Jio is only 4G. Now if by chance the 4G signal becomes a little weak the phone will search for 3G or 2G signal and in doing so the call or network signal may drop or get cut altogether since Jio is only 4G. So if I select the LTE only option the phone will latch on to the 4G signal even if it becomes a little weak.So for those who have Jio Sim and have network issues I will suggest that (1) select LTE only option in Mobile networks (2) In Access Point Names open 3 vertical dots and Reset to default and immediately reboot or restart the phone. I hope this helps.,0.9422,positive

"  I have never been a fan of customized Android phones, and have mostly preferred phones with the stock Android. I was looking to a new phone because the manufacturer of my earlier phone did not support security updates that were required for my work apps / email.This is my second Samsung phone, after the 2010-launched Nexus S. Compared to earlier phones, this feels a little big and is heavier as well. Perhaps it could be due to the battery. So far, there is nothing to complain about, but I would have liked the price to be comparable to the Redmi models. I got this one for ~ Rs. 14K, which the seller claims is at a Rs. 2K discount. I wouldn't have bothered to pay Rs. 16K for sure. The Redmi Note 9 comes in at around Rs. 12K for similar configuration. I would have bought the Redmi phone, but the reviews made me feel suspicious about it (especially about the ads being displayed).Some stand out points:¬ß Made in India: I didn't have a constraint on this one, but hey, if it's made in India, then, why not.¬ß Selfie camera: Samsung says it us 20 MP. It is definitely better than other models I have been using. (Note: I almost always prefer phones below Rs. 15K)¬ß Android 10: This itself was my constraint. I was looking only for Android 10 phones. One of the most important things for me was the support for dark mode.¬ß Reputed manufacturer: Well, Samsung is the leader. So, can't go much wrong with this brand.¬ß  Minor irritants:¬ß¬ß The setup process feels as though using the Samsung's Smart Switch app is the only way to get data from your existing phone. If you do not want to use it, the setup wizard is slightly different than the stock Android version. If you have a backup of the previous Android phone on Google, that can be used as well. However, setup takes a long time as compared to the stock Android version.¬ß¬ß The location of the back and recent app buttons on the navigation bar are swapped. I had to install a button remapper app to swap the 2 buttons.¬ß¬ß Samsung tries to push its own apps and its account sign up. I avoided it like plague, and deleted all the unnecessary apps.¬ß¬ß I prefer the Nova launcher app. I feel at home after installing this app.In short, after some customization, it was back to what I wanted.",0.9823,positive
"  The only feature I liked in this phone is the ringtone.  Camera not that great. The user feel is missing and for me it just like my 10.or E with negligible added features. The phone is overpriced at 15500 (got the mobile delivery on 12th June).  Heavy to hold and inconvenient to handle. Worst part is  Amazon doesn't have a return policy and suggested me to do a exchange instead with another brand of my choice (with heavy deduction of course). Amazon accept a return for the mobile case though and processed for refund, the mobile is lying with me and wondering what to do with it.  Am just not too happy with my choice of purchase on Amazon. I would henceforth make a resolution to buy from a mobile store after physically checking a  display piece.",-0.8122,negative

"  If you are looking for gaming mobile, then m21 shouldn't be your choice.Pros- Only display and brand nameCons- camera is third class, I was using realme 3 pro and 16mp camera is way better than m21's camera.Selfie camera is pathetic, working like 2mpAfter update camera has been worst I guess.Processor is not good, as game with normal graphics is lagging, I think pubg is not possible in this device.Ram management  is pathetic.Battery drains quicker compare to 6000mah.I played car simulator, believe me guys l, graphics are pathetic even in when kept on high.Dolby atmos, a joke from samsung, my realms 3 pro was way better in sound output when it comes to device speaker or earphones.Clarity of camera in auto mode and pro mode is worst.Don't buy guys, go for better option, seriously telling you.Don't believe  in good reviews.

"  Samsung M21 is  Manufactured in India and even brand is from S.Korea. I am very happy to move my mind from ""Xiaomi/mi to Samsung"". This is not a war, lesson for China :)I have pledge to boycott all China products!Here is the review:Good phone with long battery life, the feeling of touch is amazing. Value for money.",0.9158,positive
  Here is my review on the new samsung m21.I'm using this smartphone from 2 months so I can give my comment to help you guys make up your decision. I categorise my review based on the following points: (a) Built Quality (b) Display (c) Camera (d) Performance (e) Software (f) Battery(A) Build quality: It's a nice looking phone with a standard build quality nothing fancy on the back. Plain standardised back side with glossy finish but very well built keeping in mind it has 6000 mah battery. It's feels quite light in hands. It's a sturdy phone and it can handle if it accidentally it drops sometime. If you want to get fully packed phone in this price range it's a good phone to buy with this build quality.(B) Display: We all know samsung make great displays so here also it's a 6.4 inch water drop notch mailed display which is amazing in this price range. I bought this phone only for its great display and cameras. I mostly watch videos on my phone and it's a great experience. Even the touch response is also very good in samsung phones. Amoled display and 6000 mah battery is a great combination.(C) Camera: Camera is it's highlight in this price range. Samsung captures very good photos with a good balance of colors and natural sharp photos. The colors in photos are not over saturated. It takes very good photos. M21 has 20 mp front cam and 48 mp back camera which takes amazing photos. Samsung live focus provide some amazing features. Samsung UI is brilliant providing u some amazing features in camera.(D) Performance: Samsung's performance is quite balanced with exynos 9611 series processor. I don't do much gaming but for occasional gaming it will not disappoint you but specifically for gaming you can check out some other products with better processors in this price range. But for day to day usage it performs good and samsung hi provides great performance with this processor. So you are getting a good camera bigger battery and sufficient powerful processor.(E) Software: Samsung UI is great no ads altogether and has great features which are really useful. You can check some videos on features for samsung UI. I like the Samsung standardised UI which is great easy to use and smooth.(F) Battery: For battery it's a 6000 mah battery so you can expect a 2 days battery life for normal user and 1 day full use for heavy users who do a lot of gaming movie and videos watching. But for battery you can give 7 star and samsung did a great work by keeping the phone light weigh also with this massive battery inbuilt. So it's a great phone in this price range. Fully packed samsung phone.,0.9994,positive

  the battery is too good and pubg works fine too.i reccomend not going for brands like mi realme and other chinese brandsbloatware free (adfree) one ui is even better than stock android. camera is fine too.Another thing is that dont go for the realme 6 or 6 pro for its 90 hz display because its ips lcd.amoled 60 hz is way better than that.,0.9442,positive
  First time buying a Samsung phone and absolutely loved the experience.......the phone is 9/10 overall...The feel in the hand is really premium even with polycarbonate back...I've held glass phone and this phone doesn't feel any cheaper....Samsung didn't make any compromises with phone ...my only complain is the fingerprint scanner it takes a little swipe to unlock rather than a tap...I'm not quite used to this.....the performance in public is great too.  ...I reccomend gfx tool to achieve true 60 fps possible to GPU optimization in premium gfx tool ......the best thing about this phone is the battery ....... it's a beast and nothing can beat it in this price range....I get minimum of 8hrs of screen time in my heavy usage with the phone playing games and using social media apps.....its my new favourite phone...thx to samsung,0.9657,positive

"  I got the delivery yesterday. My last phone was Poco F1. M21 is a good phone at this price point. as its a big battery with 15W charging capacity it will take anywhere between 2.5 to 3 hrs to charge but once charged it can easily go for 2 days for non-gamer.

"  I am writing this review after using this phone for more than a month. The box comes with M21 handset, Power adapter, USB cable and ejection pin. Earphones are not included in it. The battery performance is quite good, it takes not more than 2 hrs to charge completely from zero to 100% and on medium usage, can last upto 2 days. The phone handset is very light weight as compared to M10, M20 which is very heavy to carry because of heavy weight of battery. One good thing is that the M21 handset as well charger or power adapter is made in India. As of now, the overall performance is good, battery output is efficient though there is some heating of device during charging, only sometimes & not always. Camera quality is good too but in natural light settings. I need to use this phone for some more time to further write detailed updated review but at the end of the day, Samsung can be trusted for their phones.",0.9413,positive

But my Realme 2 pro 1.5 year's old device running on latest security patch. Samsung's update policy is worst.4. Sometimes UI freezes just for 1 second. Not an issue of processor.

"  Previous generations of Samsung phones used to provide better quality though. This one provides excellent specs for the price, but doesn't come with earphones and its charging cable is very short. I have to use a USB extension cable to make up for that. Operation is real smooth and lots of space. Camera is okay, battery is great but that's the ""standard"" in the age of Mi. Fingerprint reader frequently fails. Lots of features I enjoyed in the older Galaxy J7-6 are missing though. Thankfully almost all my customizations are preserved thanks to Smart Switch. Still for a Samsung phone it has too much bloatware. Thankfully I am able to disable all of them. Guess that's why the low price, I'm content with it, with this RAM, storage and battery it'll make overall usage comfortable.",0.9815,positive

"  I'm reviewing my Samsung Galaxy M21 phone after 15 days usage & If someone tells me to say something about it in minimum words then I'll say """"It is Awesome"""". It is a perfect NON-CHINESE phone in mid range for me, I was too confused about it even after purchasing it but when i used this, I'm loving it.Pros:1. It's huge 6000mah battery survives 36 to 40 hrs in normal usage.2. Super AMOLED display having very nice colour contrast and all.3. Camera, it's selfie camera having wide angle photo option & flash too and rear cameras also clicks very nice pictures, even in night both the cameras satisfies me and are very good in this price range.4. Latest Android 105. OneUI 2.0 support which having many enexpected features like you can use more than one apps simultaneously on single screen by minimising them, and we can generate a floating button for screenshot capture, screen off & many more functions, you can hide apps, and zipped apps for saving battery and many more.6. It's Exynos 9611 processor gives a smooth performance, no lag noticed in 15 days usage.7. And one of the major factor is that it is a Non-Chinese mobile.Iske alawa bohot kuchh hai isme jo maine expect bhi nahi kiya tha.Cons:1. One thing I don't like in it is it's cheap Plastic body which is susceptible to scratches but you can manage with it by protecting it with a back cover.2. It takes approx. 3 hrs to fully charge.Bus PUBG nahi khela maine isme. So I can't say anything about that.üëçOtherwise, It completely satisfies me.üòçüòçüòç",0.9956,positive

  The battery is not actually 6000mAh but slightly less which is around 5830mAh the battery comes around for 18 hours on intensive usage which is quite good for a phone on this budget. I love the texture of the phone. But it slips a lot when used without a case better go for a spigen case which is really good combination with the phone. The interface of the phone is quite simple and very easy to use . For people with smaller hands it is quite hard to reach the top with single hand . The camera is great but it goes hazy for night shots.Overall it is a great phone .,0.989,positive
"  I had to wait for long for this mobile as I was told that this is getting sold out very soon. And indeed it stands upto its reputation. To sum up, solid built quality, excellent display,  fast processor make it stands apart from its Chinese competitors. Don't Get fooled by its specs which say that it has polycarbonate body. Its rock solid chassis justifies its price. I'm not a gamer but I bought it for my mom.  So it's perfectly alright. The battery life reminds me of old ""Hero Honda "" ad of "" just fill it and forget it"" . The speaker is not that too loud but quality of music through headphones is very good especially when you switch on Dolby atmos. I used sennheiser px80 to test it.

"  I bought M21 (4gb, 64gb), delivered on 27th june. Notice a distinct yellow tint on display (whites are ivory). have tried multiple options: vivid mode- white balance, rgb tweak, adaptive brightness, dark mode, blue light filter off, no success. Tried to search a bit, looks a like lot of people are facing yellow tint issues with Android 10 UI 2.0. Samsung: is there a fix for this?. I have a S8+ (which luckily I cant upgrade to android 10). Screen tone of S8+ (whites are whites!) and M21 (ivory whites!) are quite different. Apart from this, proximity sensor working is intermittent, voice quality on video call is pathetic! Samsung, what do I do with this phone- return option not appearing/ replacement is showing..that too if smartchk app finds something wrong (these problems are not even listed). So all doors closed? Of all the problems, worst is the display..causing severe eye strain and headaches. As of now using at near zero brightness level. Suggestion to prospective buyers: pls look elsewhere!

"  Ultimate phone.Excellent finger print reader, display, battery back up is fantastic, speed of processor is like bullet, camera quality is excellent better than other brand s phone of even higher range, memory is more than enough, in this budget this mobile is incomparable with any other brand.I am writing this review after six months of usage.Must buy..",0.9136,positive
"  This phone is very much similar to Samsug M30s. Some few differences include 20 MP front camera and android 10 in M21. First I bought M30s four month before and now I bought M21 because the price was lower by 2000/- compare to M30s.The phone performs decently in almost all aspects except battery backup. The M21 is giving highly disappointing battery backup. Even though Samsung claims that it is a 6000 mAh battery, it won't last for more than One & half day with normal usage like phone calling, messaging, WA and some banking or office apps.My M30s with same 6000 mAh, was giving (I lost it and so I bought M21) me the battery backup of 3 to 4 days leisurely.If battery life matters for you, don't go for M21, instead buy M30s only.",-0.1513,negative
"  not satisfied at all. its front cam is pathetic which has filter by default, my redmi 5A, 3 year old phone worth 6999 takes much much MUCH BETTER photos than this disgusting ''Samsung smart phone''. There was an issue of switching on of hotspot which was sorted out after contacting the Samsung agent for around 39 min.  These phones are refurbished phones and not brand new phones which i didn't know and we cant return it as its not in the  policy, we can only replace them. LOL. well.....i just wanted a budget smart phone not COMPROMISE, which now i have to. My personal suggestion-if anyone wants to buy Samsung, buy it from the store not online coz these are not new and would definitely create problems.",0.674,positive
"  1. I put the phone on charging, but it ran into a boot loop for no reason. Then I opened in factory mode. But after choosing to restart, it would again go in boot loop. Then I choose safe mode. But it did not come back to normal mode despite many efforts and restarts. The only way to restart it in normal mode was to format it. So, I had to.With my experience in the first month, I knew the phone is not stable. Nor it is reliable. So configured important folders for auto backup on Onedrive so I won't lose important photos and Data again.2. The battery is ok, yet I think not 6000mah. My 3 years old phone with 4000mah used to run for the same one day. It runs a few extra hours than the old one.Rest is no issue.",0.2335,positive
  After 1 month of usage this r my observations :)Pros:1) Excellent screen2) Great battery backup (u will have to tweak some settings to get the best battery backup).3) Decent camera performance.4) fast fingerprint sensor.5) Non-Chinese brand.Cons:1) Average processor.2) Poor Low light camera performance.3) Poor pubg performance.4) 15W fast charger is not enough takes around 2.5 hours to fully charge the phone.5) No protective case in the box.Overall: If u r looking for a reliable Non-Chinese phones for day to day tasks and light gaming then just go for this phone.,0.5423,positive

"  After 3 days of use I am posting this, bought this phone for my wife who was using Redmi Note 5.Small things which is available in competition products with lesser or same price makes lot of difference. After 6 years of experience with Xiaomi we did lot of Research to change and chosen Samsung as preferred one.But am little disappointed with the performance here is pro's & cons.Pro's:1. Slim and very light to handle2. Audio output3. Lot of features inbuilt4. Battery backup ( comes 1&half day for moderate use)5. WiFi direct callingCons:1. >2 hrs charging time2. Doesn't feels like 48 megapixel & 20 megapixel front camera.3. Screen notifications are worst, you don't have screen led light blinking when any notifications come, so everytime you have to touch the screen to check for notifications.4.  Doesn't provide back case which competition does.5. Plastic back panel looks like ordinary phone for which you have to spend 16k.Overall not fully satisfied with this phone. As mentioned Samsung, has a big brand should small things should be implemented.",-0.8428,negative
"  The Samsung M21 is a budget smartphone with professional features at a pocket friendly price. The smartphone has 48 MP camera that does justice to photos and videos. The phone has a dual sim which means it is like carrying two phones in one, without the need to lug two physical phones. The phone has VoLTE capability and supports the latest 4G SIM cards and protocols. The massive battery is a boon for those who need to keep on ""chatting/talking non-stop"". The fast charger supplied with the phone is amazing. It charges the massive battery from 0% to 40% in about 30 minutes. So when time is pricy, the Samsung M21 helps you to get on the move with the limited time and its quick charge ability. The fingerprint reader is located on the rear side and is extremely fast in responding to fingerprint recognition. It is a great buy at the given price. Go for it.",0.9657,positive

"  I love this phone and currently have no complaints regarding it. But I would love even more if its sound quality would be better. The only thing I hate about this phone is the plastic body which seems too brittle to break, but it's quite strong enough. Its 6000 mAh battery is too long-lasting and could easily give you a battery backup of 1.5 days. I even play games on it and it can easily handle COD mobile and PUBG mobile on medium settings. But if you want to play on high-end settings, I won't recommend this phone. I got this deal at 12699 and compared to the price I have paid, I am completely satisfied. Thank you Samsung and Amazon for the best delivery experience as expected.",0.9909,positive

"  I have bought this smartphone around 3 month ago. Below is my experiencePros.1. Smooth amold display will blow your heart. You will definently like display and color of display.2. 6000mah Battary will provide you breakthrough performance. You dont need to charge again and again like other phone. Charge once and use whole day.3. Camera Obviously  48 mp back camera and 20mp front will provide you amazing photography experience i am not good in clicking pictures. Hence i uploaded some of photos. I belive you can do better than me.4. It have 4GB RAM so you can do multitasking eseily. No lag while playing PUBG or COD whith high graphics setting.5. If have game launcher which is amazing feature providing by samsung. Like it will track time spending on a single game, while playing if someone calling you will get very short popup to receive call or not.6. Again amazon sevice did great work even in lockdown. (5 out of 5).7. Manufacturing in india. And samsung relible brand.Cons.1. Charging time is too long even it have fast charging still you have to give 2hour to 2 hour 30 minute for full charging.2. I didnt like back side look but i still bought beacuse of feature and brand value and pricing.So overall my final rating is 4.7 out of 5. You should go for it.",0.9356,positive
  The phone has these positive sides :1. Great display. AMOLED is hands down better than any other technology.2. Great Battery life.3. Great software experience with ONEUI.4.

"  I bought this phone for my mother but used it for couple of weeks until I orderd Vivo z1x for myself. My mother is a casual gamer and plays light games. She also watches lots of videos and stream movies. And according to her needs I found this phone a perfect match at an unbelievable price (12699). I was looking for an amoled screen as it causes less strain on eyes.Display : Display is super awesome. Very bright and accurately colorful. I use Vivo z1x (Super amoled) and Samsung's display is far superior than of Vivo's. Daylight visibility is very good.Battery : Battery backup is excellent. It is easily giving 9 to 10 hours of screen on time. Charge it once and use it entire day without worry. Buttttt there is a major con, charging speed. It's 15w charger charges the phone very sluggishly. It takes almost 2 hours and 45 minuts to charge it fully.Camera : Camera performance is mediocre. It isn't great. Photos are good in daylight condition but things get bad in low light. Selfie Camara is also mediocre. Considering the price, Camara performance justifies the price.Sound : Speaker output is decently loud and clear. Headphone output is outstanding (because of Dolby atmos support).User interface : Phone runs on One UI android 10. It is majorly seamless with no lag. One UI is nice and feels premium. It has many customization options. There are no annoying ads or recommendations.Gaming : Phone performs excellent in light gaming. No major lag. Since my mother plays light games only, it serves the purpose well. Buttttt if you are a heavy gamer, please skip it without hesitation.Network : There is no issue in network or calling. Video streaming is also excellent. Good network reception.Cons :1. Sometimes finger print sensor is hit and miss. It annoys, you just keep rubbing your finger on the sensor and nothing happens.2. If you are a heavy user (who uses lots of games and apps) then phone will not feel smooth.3. Charging speed is very poor. In this fast lifestyle, it's very hard to manage with slow charging.4. Mediocre camera performance.5. Face unlock is bit slow and doesn't perform good in low light.Conclusion : I wanted to buy a phone for my mother and this phone fulfilled all the needs such as Amoled screen, big battery, decent processor, good sound output. Camera wasn't my priority. Overall very satisfied with the product.",0.9976,positive
"  Just purchased this phone as i had no other option as i dont support chinese product anymore.The picture quality of the phone is great but the phone starts hanging while using whatsapp. Even after using it for 15min the phone becomes heated . To disconnet the call you need to tap twice on the cancel  button.I had used Samasung Galaxy J7 few years back and it was my worst experience ever. I thought Samsung being such a big company might have improved the quality after years. But i was wrong.When you spend around 14k-15k you expect a gorilla glass but it's the disadvantage with M21. My phone fell once and the screen cracked. My older phone K9 note fell many times but nothing happened coz it had gorilla glass. Pity on such a poor design configuration by samsung.Strong suggestion to buyers....Never go for Samsung , keep it as a last option to buy.",-0.9363,negative
  This my review after 4 days of purchase.  I bought this for my mother who is a teacher. She wanted a phone with screen recorder. As all classes are online for the past few months due to Covid teachers r taking online classes and submitting the same to their heads. As her old phone did not support recording on 2 mics I had purchased this phone as it is a non Chinese best brand. Butto my shock it does not support 2 mics and for her it is a waste. All other mid-range chinese phones support recording which is in built. I did not expect this from such a good brand.  This forces us to buy Chinese phones though we want to boycott Chinese products. I hope Samsung brings in a new update to correct this problem.,-0.0877,negative
"  Regualr updates are required to boost system and software  performance.Camera is awesome rear and front.Functions are smooth and buttery .Watching movies and videos are very pleasant.But Some of the bloatware and third party apps  like Helo,likee,etc are yuck and must not be preinstalled. Thank God We can uninstall  them.Go for it .You wont regret except for regular android updates. only Feb month software update is provided so far by default. DONT KNOW if they provide regular security update or not.But it's  performance is by far smooth and well.While Doing DUO video call I felt heating of phone.Let's  see if it is improved in next security update.Samsung should provide headphones,back cover, tempered  glass with phones at their end.Regards,Edit:31may 2020Yesterday  took 30/40 photos and my phone Galaxy M21 appeared hot.Photos were quite good.What astonished me is this phone's  battery management .It generally takes three days to discharge.Actually I am a moderate user So It's expected but want the same performance in future. Samsung's own EXYNOS processor needs overhauling in comparison  to qualcom snapdragon and media  tech..Will add further information in due course02 june2020YouTube playback is sometimes stuck which I Experienced two three times.Software update is major issue.My preused samsung headphone is not compatible with its Jack.Loose .So doesn't works it ought  to be.My Nokia is much better than this phone is every aspect.Not a single time Hang or stuck during any usage.Samsung's  main problem is its processor which is required to be reengineered.In 30 july2020 got an update which was done  vastly. It feels good when the phone is updated regularly since it removes glitches and boosts performance.Samsung is listening its consumers I guess so it is providing updates.What I see in this update is battery is draining  a little faster than before.I am satisfied.Samsung should provide earphone, backcover and screen guard with every models I reiterate.Regards,My review is being altered.for some days  this phone has gone unexpectedly unresponsive. Touch is hectic and the display panel is heated .Samsung has provided me used phone by Amazon. I swear I will never buy  and persuade anyone to buy Samsung mobile ever.",0.9398,positive
"  So I hv used it now for two days and here are my reviews:phone is big enough at this range. Performance is great. There is a dark mode avalable for all android system which I really liked. I am more into camera and I will rate this camera 4. There is too much exposure for photos. But night mode is too good. THis is perfect for low light imaging. But it will overexpose, so u will have to reduce the brightness. Also normal video will zoom a bit which I dont like. But u can shoot it in wide view as well which gives it a different feeling. The pro mode of camera for photos is less adjustable but it can overcome these limitations very well.The battery certainly lasted about 1.5 day on average usage with games, photos videos etc. At this price I think this is a v good deal.",0.9649,positive
"  Yes.Cost efficiency is what i would call the super trait of M21 to be.This is the worthiest set to be bought at around ‚Çπ 15k. Best Battery capacity and display (super AMOLED!) at this rate. Decent chipset.Been using it for a month. And it, indeed, is very good in overall performance and is more cost effective than I thought. In fact more cost effective than all the Mid Range phones I've bought so far.A massive 6000mAh Battery will sustain the phone for minimum a day but to be honest it does not deserve the hype it got. Also inclusion of a faster charger would have made me happier. But im still happy man!It Does heat up a little bit while charging. But seriously manages to keep the cool even while heavy RAM usage.The design is not appealing coming with a plastic body. This is a small negative which is overshadowed by the remaining overwhelming positives of M21.The april 2020 update is good.

"  I was searching for a phone under 14,000 which would be great for multitasking, daily use & regular gaming and the biggest thing was a great battery. I found many cheap phones from chinese brands making with about 1,000 rupees of difference. But they were unreliable and not as rough and tough as SAMSUNG is. The phones made by SAMSUNG are the most rough and tough phones you can find. And M21 would be a great pick for you. I am using this phone since 2 months and I don't have a single complain, not even a single complain. The phone is great for battery because the 6000mAh battery lasted all day long. I did multitasking and little bit gaming and used my phone the whole day. I just kept it in charge at night for half hour and then it worked for me all day long. The processor and RAM is also too good because I don't see any framedrops, not even a single framedrop in gaming. It is a very smooth experience and the next thing is that it never lagged when I was operating it, never ever. The camera is also a nice pick, the 48 mp camera gives you an awesome shot with the 8mp and 5mp secondary cameras. I also liked the selfie camera because it's of 20 mp and is enough for taking breathtaking selfies. The samsung UI is also a nice pick with a good look and updates also come regularly. The display is just awesome, it is just breathtaking. The Amoled display with the notch gives you a big hit.

"  Just after 2 weeks of purchase, this Samsung M21 smartphone suddenly got hung and a portion of the screen is not responsiive. Immediately I  raised a complaint. The technical guy of customer care not even bothered to listen to the complaint. He just told that the return policy expired two days back, just two days and I dont even know about it. How can one expect that this kind of cheap goods being delivered to us. They can stop working at any time if they are too cheap. Amazon thinks the customers are like fools living in amazon forest. They should consider the complaint and need to respond in a constructive way. IN this pandemic matter of two days should be considered and extended.Apart from all these, the service is so bad and irresponsible. They are saying go to the samsung service centre. If we can go there why should one buy from your site? Because we believe better service from you irrespective of who the seller is. If its an offline purchase we should have checked every thing there itself physically. Since its Amazon we blindly ordered just by seeing images but later realized that it is also like ultra low grade e-marketing company after talking to this customer service guy. I just dont want to take his name. When I say how can we go out in this circumstances as ours is containment zone. He simply told not to order from amazon as they also cant deliver here. Amazon should seriously look into this guys behaviour. He is going to make you loose many customers.Finally, I suggest not to buy electronic products, particularly samsung brand from Amazon. Please go and buy offline. They are also suggesting the same indirectly.",-0.3196,negative

"  Purchased Galaxy M21 for sister as it is non-Chinese. But now I am regretting not buying other brand. Such pathetic M series was not expected from Samsung.Only gud thing abt this phone is Amoled display, large battery and decent camera.Rest everything is impractical...be it1. Plastic back- plastic back is finger print magnate and will get scratches easily.2.Rear fingerprint placement- fingerprint position is so upward that literally u need to find it . Also it is so flat with back body making diffictly in distinguishing fingerprint sensor with back body.3. Slow Processor- processor is slow/laggy. Phone started getting slow from 1st day of usage. Slow opening of app or buffering type slow response which irritates a lot.4. Heating issue- Most pathetic thing abt this phone is its heating issue. Means it will heat more at earpiece area only(upper part of phone). I have used other phones also...but samsung makes record among all in term of heating issue.5. No screen protector and phone cover- Many brands which are much cheaper than Samsung and gives equal quality at low price, include screen protector and phone cover but I don't know why Samsung is doing this. Now I will have to buy it separately.Overall I am disappointed with Samsung mid range phones as they are not made for practical purpose. It will not be wrong to say why brands like Mi, realmse got big boom over Samsung. They provide every practical need which we want.Sorry samsung but this will be my last purchase of samsung phone.",-0.9707,negative

  First I bought this phone as my old phone bricked and I needed one urgently. Only criteria was a not a made in china decently modern phone. This one a21 and 31 were trending in market though my research 6 months back wanted me to buy an a50 something these two had the same features CPU etc and processor but lesser ram and storage and one camera less and some megapixels lesser but who needs them anyway. All I need is one decent camera on each side.The camera in this is decent and has multiple modes and options like AR AI and wide angle and so on. Its confusing and I felt not in control. So sticking to 16:9 standard pics. Still the depth is pixelated even at 48 MP.The amoled screen is amazing in vivid colors though it can be quite hard on the eyes. I am keeping it in dark mode mostly and there is also a blue filter. There are also calm modes which put the phone in black and white and do not disturb mode for me time  away from phone.The phone is quite bulky by today's standards about a centimeter with a cover. It doesn't have 5g support either which many new phones bring.This is a mostly made in india phone with exception of charger cable from Vietnam and I am sure the processor and circuits made in Taiwan or china. Nevertheless it was refreshing to see a made in india phone designed by Samsung in a world where anything we buy is made in china. Though I must say the finish of the product and packing is not of such high quality as chineese brands like xiaomi vivo not even compare to one+. But the product itself is of higher quality than chineese phones.The cost is much higher than normal times perhaps due to pandemic or import curbs from china. Atleast 4k more. Such phones are in the 10k range but still feature to feature similar prized mi or others have more cameras and glass body and many more features. Brought this only cos of Made in India.but it has to become  competitive in terms of quality and price to be successful.Update: After a weeks use updating to 5 star. 3 day battery though no real fast charging takes 3 hrs to charge full. Performance is top notch no lag or hang and smooth even with extra animations enabled. Overall happy with the phone.,0.9808,positive
"  I had been always buying budget phones from Chinese brands for my Parents until now. Then I heard about the new Samsung M Series range of phones making sensation in the market with Super AMOLED screen and good configurations for the price. Decided to give it a try this time and ordered the M21 for my dad. Upon receiving the phone, I was blown away by the almost everything this phone was offering in this price range. The screen quality is amazing with definite 2 days battery life. The performance of the phone is more than adequate and easily compares to any other sub 15k phones, but the camera quality, battery and the screen quality surpasses almost all others in this segment. The screen quality is better than even my twice expensive phone which is having IPS TFT panel.Pros:Great screenCamera qualityBattery backupPerformanceSoftware refinementCons:Weight. But its justifying given the massive battery size.Plastic Body. But to be frank, we use phones with cases. So in that case, plastic body is safer than glass. So not a con actually.No bundled earphones. That too can't be really complained in this price range and also currently, no one is supplying the same.Verdict:I am loving it more and my dad is also happy since its a Korean and non Chinese brand and Proudly Made in India phone. This purchase made me order an M31 for my mother the next day, since she is really keen on phone camera quality than my dad, and since this 13k phone amazing for its camera, was having even high hopes for an 18k phone which is having higher camera specs.",0.9934,positive
"  Battery life is the main USP of this M series, camera quality is not upto expected but at this price range seeing the other specs the little camera quality can be compromised and if you can really want a good camera then go for M31 or M31s . samsung gives the best amoled display it's a no brainer. Fingerprint is very fast , face unlock is good but not at best but fingerprint unlock works really fast, phone runs smooth as well I'm not a gammer so don't know about that , there is little heating issue only while charging the phone , otherwise I haven't noticed heating issue, the phone comes with minimal blootware that's the best , it is not like any Chinese brands like MI , oppo , realme where you notice adds , so in this samsung one UI there is a near to a stock android experience without blootware and adds and that's very good as well",0.9794,positive
  I loved this phoneThis has pure samsung flaship level touchresponse.Amoled display is amazing.Battery is amazing.And apart from all theseLook very expensive one in black color .Camera is good .Not heating .Network reception is amazing .Call quality is good .Speaker is good.Its like you hold jewel in your hand .This fone doesnt looks like cheap smartphones like redmi xaomi and real me .Build quality is amazing .If you are not a gamer then go for it under 20k .This is best smartphones and cheapest from samsung.I have recently used realme xt but that one also not feels expensive in your hand .In every aspect this fone is far above the chineese fones.And UI is amazing like you will never get that feeling from any other chinees brand .Amazing fone go for itThink twice before going to choose chineese brand if u r not a gamer .I loved it .,0.9908,positive
"  Do you want an android phone?Do you've a higher perceived brand value for Samsung?Is your budget under INR 13K?If your answer for all of these is YES, then do not wait, just buy it !*** The Processor Debate ***This Snapdragon Vs. Exonys Vs. Mediatek etc, this is all just topics of debate for youtubers. They need content for their channels, don't put your mind in tizzy unless you are a heavy gamer and your life depends on nano-seconds of lag.Yes all these processor debate end at the difference of nano seconds which in real life is even way beyond blink and miss. You can't notice it even if you are Rajnikant. So chose a phone which is VFM for you.*** Perceived Brand Value of Samsung ***Lets just put it out here, Samsung is the Apple of Android world. Right or wrong ? 100% Right !!For me, i always recommended Xiaomi phones to folks who want innovation on a budget. But if you want and Apple but one running Android then Samsung is best bet for you.*** Durability ***Samsung phones are durable and so are even MI phones. I have one Mi A1 still working in mint condition used by my mother. So your decision making should be based on the brand value doe you.*** Battery ***One thing Samsung has learnt for its entry level and mid level offerings is to rightly capture the need. People need large capacity batteries because mobile phone has become one of our limbs, extension of our body part.Added benifit : decent camera , 3.5 mm jack.*** To Summarize ***If you do not want a Xiaomi or Real Me or Moto because you want a SAMSUNG, then go for it, because**** it has massive juice to last**** oh you've a SAMSUNG*** take those ü§≥ selfiesTo suarize",0.9522,positive
"  After several research and watching many you tube videos related to drop test and other stuffs bought this mobile but I regret for buying this mobile, just dropped the mobile by 2 feet height, the so called gorilla  glass broke into pieces. Very worst manufacturing just the brand name is getting marketed and sold but product is of cheap quality. Pls also see the pics of broken glass before you decide to buy. My old redmi note 4 is far better in terms of build quality.",-0.9422,negative
"  I have been using a smaller 5"" form factor phone for almost 3-4 years. Had been wanting to buy my next phone for quite some time and finally bought this one.And I would say I'm content with the it.It has a vibrant display best in class I would say. I don't notice the U notch for sometime of usage.Good speaker not something loud but good enough.Good cameras for the price! Some might find the selfie camera less impressive but its good enough for social media needs.Excellent battery! Better than all those 1000$ phones! üòÅAnd the performance is fine enough for me, I get some lags here an there but nothing which makes trouble in my daily tasks. I would say the performance is same as compared to my old phone S6 Edge, which is good as it still runs smoothly! üòÅ Btw, I don't game much!!Perfect to gift it to your mom, dad or anyone in your family. It has good big fonts. And no bogus softwares you might see in other brands!I would say I made a right decision to not invest in a premium phone and saved a lot of money.

"  One of the best in market* sAMOLED 6.4 is delivering high satisfaction  Display is big, good, sharp, crisp and clear  enough, Bright colours.  one of the top reason  to go for M21*Dolby atmos gives amplified audio output* Battery is like ocean* Camera is Crystal Crisp* Fast enough* Best in budget* Video experience is just wowBut also know itBody is plastic but glossy , looks goodThe frame finishing does not give a luxurious feel. But a good cover can do that, anyways you will use a cover to protect it. So this reason should no stop you from getting M21.But when you use It, overall performance is going to be satisfying. 200 % recommend this mobile",0.9782,positive
"  Overall the phone is excellent at this price point.  You cannot go wrong with it.The pros1) Superb 6.3"" display with SuperAMOLED : This is really great to have. There are many higher end phones which are pricier, but every time you view on your phone the display is something that goes beyond its segment2) Awesome battery: I believe this is something very important far more than only performance.  Can be a life saver during the occasional instance when you have forgotten to charge it.  Till now  with most never dropped below 30% charge.  Have a reserve charge is good.Also:  The 15W fast charger is fast enough unlike what people believe.  Just don't wait to charge it until its fully discharged.3) One UI on Android 10 and processor performance: Samsuns's OneUI is decent and consistent now across devices. It looks modern and works without lags. Ofcourse its not a gamer or performance phone. But the Exynos 9611 processor is good enough for most tasks for most people.  Also I am sure Samsung will update to Android 11 and maybe even 12.4) Sales and Service: Not much direct experience, but I see that the service center availability is so much better than my previous phone (ASUS Zenfone)5) Signal Reception and SAR: Having a low SAR value is important . WIFi and call reception is excellent. Speaker is loud and clear.Cons:If I have to pick one con for this phone, its the camera. Its average - if I compare it to the ASUS Zenfone 3, a older phone - but then ASUS specializes in the camera area.So camera is average just like most phones at this price point .",0.9906,positive
"  Performance of the phone is good so far. The finger print scanner is is indeed very fast but the best thing I like about this phone is its super amoled display; it is a treat to watch videos on this phone. Camera I personally don't use much, but the quality of front and rear cameras is pretty good especially the night mode which is very helpful in taking pics in low light.Looks good in hand and it is very lightweight which is an added advantage. Now the storage of 128 GB of which 100 gb is at your disposal which practically eliminates the need for external storage for an average user like me. Sound quality is also good and you can listen to your favourite music anytime.The only drawback is battery which as mentioned 6000mAh doesn't seems to be working as long as it should. It still manages to get 36 hours of usage after full charge which takes almost 2 hours with the fast charging feature.Overall considering the price range it is a very good phone with all the necessary features packed in a compact and lightweight device for the average user.",0.995,positive

"  Its a shame that a phone with such great hardware does not have a competing software to complement it. Its one ui2 is inferior to MIUI found on MI/xiaomi phones IMO. If you're used to MIUI like me then some may be disapointed on software front:-pros:-battery life,camera,fast charger,excellent displaycons:-# no usb 3.1 gen2# no bluetooth 5.1 only(5.0)# no wifi 6 supportsoftware(UI) issues# missing call record option during the call.# missing native app lock feature. This is a big one as third party apps are very poor and MIUI version is great. Samsungs 'S Secure' is a breather but not as good as MI's app lock. you have to unlock each app individually in s secure and install it separately.# if you hide text message content on lock screen it gets hidden when you're logged in as well.# No messages feature which can't detect OTP's in messages.# poor file manager compared to MI and google# no support for showing network speed in status bar# no ability to set daily data limits only monthly limits can be set.# very basic messages app compared to MIUI version# more bloatware and app control than MIUI, can'e even uninstall facebook(only disable).# can't limit the number of connected devices via hotspot.# even taking screenshots is more intuitive and fast in MIUI where you just swipe three fingers down the screen or use the button in notification panel. Samsung uses yet another app for screenshots to which you have to grant permission to save the screenshot although you do not have to install it separately.Most of software limitations can be overcome by installing third party or samsung's own apps. But they will slow the phone down as native(OS) implementations are much faster. Also most of these are small usability tweaks which should not take too much efforts to implement but they will improve the user perception of their phones because many people will install apps for these features and slow their phones down and then blame samsung for building slow phones. Hope samsung is listening to this for their own sake.",0.61,positive
"  Overall good product from Samsung at cheapest price.For me Samsung is most trusted brand from 2004 untill now.Most impressive part of this phone is it's huge two-three days battery backup.And most attractive S-Amoled display.Great sound quality (better than my old galaxy on8)Clean UI6 GB OF RAM128 GB OF ROMBlue colour looks awesome.And a faster processing unit for gaming and multitasking.At last not the least ""Made in India""Love u Samsung India",0.9516,positive
"  SAMSUNG GALAXY M21(4/64).Design - Subjective(I liked it).Build - Sturdy (but using back case and tempered glass suggested)Battery - 6000Mah around 2 days of battery life and charge time is around 2hrs 30mins if 10% battery left.Camera - Shots are well captured and image processing is good. End result is appreciable.Screen Quality - It's Samsung, need not worry about display. Good colour reproduction in SAMOLED. Nice touch response.Processor - Exynos 9611, this is pretty capable of handling almost every task u throw at it. But don't expect heavy gaming like Snapdragon 800 series. Exynos 9611 is similar to Snapdragon 730.OS - Snappy and didn't face any lags.Network reception - Didn't face any issue with BSNL, Wifi..etc.Audio output - Loud enough in the budget range(around 17k).I would suggest this phone if ur requirement is basic to medium likeWhatsApp, instagram, Facebook, YouTube, entertainment, medium gaming.",0.9869,positive
"  Call quality: The phone serves best as a phone. Excellent sound quality and call quality and handoff over VOWIFI and VOLTE. The person can hear my voice clear as well.Didplay: Feels premium while holding the phone, however not so while looking at it from the back side.Networking: The only catch is the network speed. While other phones connect with 150mbps link speed to my  wifi router this phone connects to 2.4Ghz band at max 72mbps and 5Ghz band at around 400mbps. While tested on 2.4Ghz band, the network speed drops compared to my Huawei devices. On 60mbps connection I am getting 30mbps max while on the Huawei device I am getting 56mbps max. Although call quality is good, network signal strength drops to -80dBm compared to Huawei Honor 6x device @ -60dbm. 4G speed on LTE is also below the Huawei device. Getting 4mbps downlink on this device compared to 15mbps downlink on the huawei device. Wifi signal also drops very often and refuses to connect to the router.

"  Honestly, my thoughts were divided when I was purchasing this handset. There are so many reviews, so many mobiles and so many features in this price range.

When I opened the box and switched it on, I immediately started feeling better. As I explored it further, I realized that all those marketing gigs are nothing but propaganda.What I purchased is a perfectly blended masterpiece of quality, performance and price.Amazing picture quality with rich color and perfectly balanced contrast; smooth touchscreen without any lags even when all my regular apps are loaded in RAM.Finally I would say, it has completely satisfied my needs.

"  It's practically the same phone as M31 from inside , only difference being camera quality and back plastic finish.I don't care about the back plastic finish as i always put covers on my phones - which you should do too. This is a damn good phone, don't overthink it just get it.When i was buying this phone i was really confused which one to get -M31, Redmi note 9 pro, etc.  But i took the leap and got this one - and i'm really happy. Don't be too critical if you want a robust phone that gets the job done.I was blown away by the AMOLED screen and whenever i see some images on it i still can't believe how good the screen is. At night the blacks are ABSOLUTELY black - an image with black background will look like it's floating if you're in a pitch dark room - point being the contrast is amazing.Camera is great, could be better - but that could be said for literally every phone. On this budget itna hi milega.Battery life is GREAT. I use it mildly for whatsapp, instagram, casual games, google apps, camera etc. and i honestly forget to charge my phone in 2 days, and i charge it on 3rd day morning.I recommend getting 6gb ram 128gb storage version.Just get it - don't think too much, don't waste time comparing, just get it.Highly recommend.",0.9916,positive

Whether it's YT or Amazon Video or Netflix u can watch it in highest quality.3. Camera - Decent camera. Absolutely ok for normal regular selfies and videos.4. User interface - Awesome experience with the latest UI. Very light, almost like stock android. No unwanted ads or bloatwares. Fantastic.5. Android security updates - U get updates very fast. Probably after google and nokia phones Samsung is the third best in this area.Cons -1.Back made of plastic - Gives it a cheap feel.2. Ok Processor - The processor is not super powerful.

"  So you wanted to buy a budget Samsung phone and you bought this piece is junk! I wanted to warn you all, this phone will develop problems..I started having touch issues within 3 months. So you go to the service centre and hope they fix it. What you don't know is that the service centre will tell you parts are not available and you will be given full refund in the form of a gift certificate that can ONLY be used in offline Samsung stores! So you'll go and start looking for offline stores only to realise it's only the Samsung smart cafe's that accept the gift certificate. You'll also realise that none of the m-series will be sold offline! Then you are forced to shell out 2k or 3k more to but an A series. This whole thing is a huge scam. Avoid this model and Samsung. They are cheating people",-0.8452,negative
"  Phone has heating issues, battery charge takes 2hrs:45mins to get full charge Camera not upto the mark though we have many camera features. Slim and good design, colour is good but cheap quality plastic back mayerial. I didnt like.  Processor compamy promises a powerful chipset. But while playing games, its quality is poor. Lags in Between. Its worst. I'd suggest you to go for realme 5pro in this price range. Overall out of 5 I'd rate 2.2 - 2.5",-0.6721,negative

"  Package was well packed. It doesn't xome with protective film/tempered glass and back case so add +300rs.Phone is lightweight considering its dimensions and 6000mah battery.Finger print is quite fast, camera is very good better than note9pro, note8 pro but i can hardly say that camera is better than note7 pro( which has great sensor + gcam compatablity).Charging is the weak link of m21/m31. Its gets fully charged around 2hour 30mins. Battery life is quite good. You can put it in darkmode to get extra battery life(thanks to a beautiful amoled).Many would argue it is not fast. But 90% dont care about if its loads 2-4 apps 1 sec later than note9pro. OneUI is quite efficient, and taking about UI its way cleaner than RealmeOS, funtouchOS its one the level of OxygenOS (if not better). You'll not see pathetic, adult adds like from shareIT, UC, Mi browsers or realme browser.(Of course you can turn it off but many are just pathetic).And taking about chinese, samsung has closed or shifted many of its manufacturing units from china. And its biggest manufacturing unit is India, and samsung has started manufacturing its flagship smartphone here in Noida. Thus we can say that it's the best brand who is least relies on china.On that Note, ""software in a week , hardware im a year"" - Sonam wangchuk.",0.9843,positive

"  After one month of usage i found that in low light front cam is an absolute tragedy.We can see grains while zooming in a pic taken at low light.Night mode in rear cam is also comedy.But in daylight it's a real monster.Dolby feature is only available when headset is plugged in which i didn't feel any difference when turning on/off Dolby Atmos.One thing to mention about this device is its sAMOLED display.It's a real treat to eyes.If you are a series/film addict you should go for it.I can see a whole lot difference between normal lcd display and sAMOLED.No problem with network reception/speed like Qualcomm powered devices.Fast 2 day delivery and packed with powerful battery and processor,fast biometric recognition, i think it is the best budget phone in India now(If you are a photoholic pls avoid this, even i have regrets).Another defect i found is it heats up heavily when we use it under sunlight or use it in closed conditions like car etc.Don't know it's because of sAMOLED display.But sure not it's battery.Thanks seller. 1 star less for bad low light sensor/camera.",0.4102,positive

"  Hi... I am from Kerala, aleppy. I am reviewing this #wattamonster samsung galaxy M21 black after one week of my high usage. I am really impressed with the sAmoled screen which couldn't avoid any cost from my 1st level experience. Battery capacity is outstanding and really thankful to samsung for this model. I am financially an average man. So for me it is affordable and am extremely happy with this model. Moreover I am so happy and proud to use a samsung product than any chines product.

"  PRO'S1. Good weight distribution of the phone.2. Amazing screen.3. Best fingerprint reader for this budget, amazingly fast.4. Samsung's one UI is good.CON'S1. 6000 Mah battery stated by samsung but it doesn't feels like. I have previously used 5000 mah phone but this one feels like it has 4000mah approx.If i even used it for normal games like candy crush it does not even last 1 day.2. Worst camera. This is the worst part as many people when buying a mid ranger expects to have a decent camera performance so that they can atleast take good photos for the social media or any other work.BUT the camera performance is so poor that i was disappointed in it.The photos have no clarity when you even zoom in a little bit into the photos.This is very bad coming from Samsung.TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED WITH SAMSUNG.",-0.9788,negative
"  I am writing this review after using M21 for a week. And my review is based on truly improved Samsung M series with my best experience1.BUILD QUALITY.Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount.2.DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT.With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Fingerprint on back is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.3 SOUND QUALITY.After using for hours I found the Speaker this time Samsung made is much improved with Bass Stereo which was missing earlier. The in-ear delivers your ear the pure Dolby Atmos with clear precision and crystal clear bass effect.4.CAMERA.This time M series did a great job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 48 mwgapixel with Single Take feature. Samsung gives what it advertises. Which made me to stick to Samsung brand. My usage of Camera is high &  well lit captured shots5.BATTERYMain benefit of this midrange M series is it's maasive 6000mAh battery which gave me enough for nearly 3 days continuously.So I highly recommend everyone who need a budget phone with high specifications need to buy this ..Worth for Money paid..",0.9934,positive

"  A very good battery life. Almost 18% decrease after 4hours of continue usage. Charging time almost 2hr 30min. Earphone sound quality is very very good. Use a good earphone with this phone. And it's super amoled display is more than super. You will feel every video. I can't describe it with words.Camera quality is too good. You can not get this type of camera in any 15k phone. I don't know about gaming but the phone is too smooth to operate. Charging cord is not so long but I don't think this is a major problem. Till now I don't feel any kind of heat. Its microfone is moderate but not bad. It's ok. Almost 15gb Rom is used by system. And listen, kindly update your system as soon as you get this phone. Check it.  A system update is already available which is 450mb in size.At last, at 14k it is an amazing phone. You can go for it.Stay safe guys. Good Luck.",0.9864,positive
"  Excellent phone. Hardware configuration and working are really good. Signal reception, camera are good.One issue with software: Kid's (3-4yr) voices are not being captured by few apps - Live Transcribe, Google Meet, WhatsApp video. Irony is WhatsApp voice recorder is able to capture but not the video. Inbuilt voice recorder is also able to capture (hence my claim that hardware is good). Giving 4 star out of 5 for this reason.Had to return the product only because of this issue. Amazon's service was really good: They first accepted replacement, when the replaced piece had same issue, I placed request for return. Amazon kindly considered it and refunded the entire cost.

"  Great camera and battery life, and One UI really sweetens the whole experience, BUT...If you search for yellow/tint in comments you'll find many users have noticed the amoled display despite its clarity and contrast has a slight defect and has a red/yellow tint when looking directly at the screen (at 0¬∞), which shifts depending on the angle.For me it is reddish on the top halfDarkmode eases the experience, but once u notice it you can't unnotice it and its very hard to get over it. Most users would be blown away by an AMOLED clarity and contrast and might not notice it.It is a common defect found in cheaper Samsung panels.Unless ur OK with unnatural color tint on ur screen, I would recommend AGAINST buying this phoneGoing to send mine for a replacement... I'll update what hapoens",0.8392,positive

Battery charging speed is also good, took around 2.5 hrs to full charge. Dint felt the heat as seen in MI.Video & Audio quality is superb.

"  A good photos which decent performance in all segments like battery backup, camera, display etc.  i purchased this for my mother and she is quite happy with her phone.Samsung phones generally have a very low SAR value  and thus they are a very good options for you of you are planning for buying for your loved ones.Here are my top reasons to choose Samsung over others chinese products which are offering so much in this price range1) S.Amoled ( because this is the most used features atleast for my mother she have nothing to do with performance etc)2) Low SAR Value ( Samsung provide the lowest SAR value in mobile market)3) No Android Ads ( unlike Realmi/redmi where ads are a major problem and sometimes they are very inappropriate to scroll in public)And thats it, however if you are gamer or camera lovers thans this is not your cup of team better look for other options in this price segment.",0.9626,positive
"  Like - Samsung UI experience was very good, enjoyed using as it is my first Samsung phone. Enjoyed watching movies & youtube. Colours are vibrant.Dislike -Camera - very badIt does not have stabilization. Image processing is pathetic. 48mp (rear) & 21mp (front) is just a gimmick. You just cant have good a picture, as it completely changes the photo texture. (I had Motorola X Play with 21mp as rear camera and used it for 5 years, picture taken were very good. If we zoom it, it would provide with very good details). May be some would be interested in getting picture which are soft texture rather than more of natural image, those can give a shot at this phone.Video - Just forget of taking a good video! No stabilization and keeps blurring.Battery - Not good.Handset which I have got, I have observed that if I use phone with Wifi - it works around 1-2 days based on my use. But, when I use mobile network then I see that phone does not even last a 12 hours with general use such as browsing, streaming (I dont play games so I wont comment on battery life for games).Opinion - If you really want to buy this phone, first you check this phone personally with someone who is already using it and then buy it. I have seen many good reviews about this phone, so above points which I have written is based on my experience with this handset. If you want to buy Samsung, I would say go for A series such as A50s or A51 or A71 depending on your budget. If you dont have budget (like I had constraint) and want to go with Samsung then you will have to live with its cons.Note - There is no return option, you can get replacement but that will be a task for you.",0.865,positive
"  This phone is only best for battery and nothing else. The camera is not so good as compared to the other phones in this price segment. The audio output from the speaker is very low, even samsung has mentioned that it has Dolby Atmos which enhances the audio output but whenever I put the Dolby Atmos function ""on"", There is no audio enhancement, such a poor audio output quality from both speaker as well as the 3.5 mm earphone jack. Also, the body build quality is very bad and cheap. Samsung mentioned that it has L1 support for the HD video content but whenever watching hd quality video even on the youtube, it degrade video quality form high to low resolution. And at the end, with such bad impression while holding and operating this phone, feel that the price of this is much high. It should be around 8k to 9k only for the quality they are selling. Go for the Nokia phones, they are far better than all these kind of phones.",-0.9201,negative
"  I am writing this review after using this phone for more than a month.1) fingerprint sensor is not that good as of oppo / vivo / moto. Sometimes it may takes 2-3 attempts to open the phone with fingerprint sensor.2) camera quality is great of back side. But front camera is not as much good as it says of 20 mega pixel. In proper lights front camera works excellent.3) there's no as such hanging but sometimes it start lagging for a second or few.4) sound quality is decent.5) the back cover of phone is of plastic material so after using it for a month with backcover though, there are few scratches.6) there is inbuilt hidden space in the phone in which you an hide photos or videos . But there is no security lock facility. So you can create a hidden folder but indirectly it's of no use as anybody can just open it by going to gallery settings.7) battery life is excellent.  And yeah takes time in charging but it's 6000mh battery. I'm a non gamer person, so in my case once a battery gets fully charges the phone works for around 1.5 day efficiently.Final remark :- it's is a decent phone from Samsung in this price range. Although if you are okay to buy Chinese phones than there several other phones also which you can find good in this price range.",0.224,positive
"  After 3 days of using here is my review-1. Battery is Good even though I am heavy user it's holds fine.2. Camera isn't good it simply isn't and if you are thinking about downloading Gcam here is the bad news, Gcam doesn't support exynos.3. I don't know about gaming as I don't play games so you can check it on YouTube.4. Build quality is really good even though it's plastic.5. It's a nitpick but I wish it had gorrila glass 5 instead of 3.6. Screen is beautiful. My sister bought redmi note 8 and let me tell you the difference between them is real, Amoled is really different.So overall it's a phone for people who want a battery life, decent camera(I guess), and good performances with beautiful screen at only 12699.",0.9612,positive
"  Hi,I switched to samsung brand after using MI phones after current against china situation. Overall Product is good.below are my comments.1. Back panel body is of plastic which gives premium look but at the same time shows fingers marks.2. Camera quality is descent.3. Battery is 6000 MAH but need to recharge on daily basis without playing any games, only accessing emails and whatsapp chats4. Front screen touch feels feathersoft.5. Finger print sensor does its job very smoothly6. Problem with data, my other phone shows all 4 network bar (Full coverage) however after inserting same sim in this phone, I never seen it went more than 2 bars. Also phone's data connection gets OFF after receiving voice call even after I kept ""Use mobile data during calls"" option ""ON"" (major problem). I asked samsung customer care, but still problem is the same..Samsung needs to work on this.About replacement:I got phone replaced with in 2 days, But again the same issue with the phone, however using same SIM in REDMI phone it works perfectly for network bar and connectivity. Need refund for the same, Very disappointed with the product.",-0.7836,negative
"  I'm using 6GB/128GB Variant of this device from last three days, so my review will be on the basis of 3 days experience with the device and I will update it after I spend more time with the device.0. Design & Build - I prefer a good looking phone but this phone is simple in looks, simple look doesn't mean bad look but it is not very good looking also. Fingerprint is given at the back of phone and phone is built by using plastic material & I got two scratches on the backside so please order a back cover when you order phone as there is no backcover in the box. Display is protected by gorilla glass 3.1. Camera - I'm not a selfie lover but I use camera in daily life for clicking images of receipts, flowers and some random pics of different objects. Sometimes the camera will give you very good results if there is proper lighting but some shots are noisy if I talk about camera quality. Front camera clicks well also. Night shots are not great but considering budget it's okay as every phone struggles to click good pictures in night. If you want to install GCAM then it is not supported very well in this device, there are many mods but functions don't work properly.2. Display - You will get best display in this price range with this device, great for media consumption.3. Performance - I'm not a gaming person but I use a lot of apps in smartphone, I have installed around 30+ apps in my phone but didn't face a lag in opening & switching the apps till date. I don't know about gaming performance of the device.4. Software - It runs on Android Q(10) with heavy customizations from Samsung who calls it One UI 2.0. There are a lot of bloatware apps pre-installed in the device but the good news is you can either uninstall them or disable them. The UI is very intelligently designed and feels very smooth & engaging. It's colorful & feature-rich. You can use dual apps and always on-display is a good feature that I'm using now. Explore the phone settings and you will get to know more of the exciting features present on this phone. But honestly I loved the UI designed by samsung. I'm using a Samsung device for the first time in my life & I'm happy about the software. It's very easy to use.5. Battery - Battery takes approx. 3 hours to fully charge but after a charge you can easily expect a 1-2 day battery life with mixed usage. Battery life is really good on this smartphone.6. Fingerprint reader & face unlock are really very fast & accurate most of the times.So my suggestion is if you need a smartphone with great display, good software, good camera, very good battery life then go for it but If you prefer good build quality with good looks , very high gaming performance or a very great camera device you can check other options. I will update the review If I notice something really good or bad about the device later but for now I'm more than happy with this device.",0.9987,positive
"  Writing this review after using for more than one month. Pros- smart slim looks, awesome display, touch function very smooth, great camera quality, user friendly camera features, processor os etc of latest versions, fingerprint reader working fineCons- Battery is problematic in terms of Charging time & Overheating. After using for one month I find that it takes 3hours or more to be charged full(from 8% to 100% it took 3hrs 10mins) everytime. I dont understand what is the point of giving a Fast charger then! Battery survives one 24-30 hours with moderate to heavy use, which is fine. But the charging time is too much. Also, it gets heated quite often if you have kept your data on, after few mins of turning off data it cools down. It may be possible I unfortunately received one product with problems, but, yes, my dissapointment over this one battery issue outdid its all other good features.",0.8338,positive

I got this at 15.2K , 3K cheaper than the poco.I think for someone with similar budget can choose this phone over poco, xaomi or honor bcoz it has exynos 9611 that is a good processor , excellent picture quality (although some may say that i doest have 4 camera but i find picture quality of all the phones with 2 or more camera as same),128/6 memory and sAMOLED is the real deal maker.And whats more samsung phones have higher working life - they easily lasts for 18 to 24 months(my previous phone, samsung A50 running perfectly since April 2019 without even a minor issue) and resale value is good as well.Good luck !!!!",0.9835,positive
"  This is the best thing which has been done in MID RANGE mobile phone till date. You won‚Äôt believe; where other phones struggle to keep them alive till day end and you have to put charger on. It is left with so much of juice that it needs charging only the next day in the morning after 10 AM. I am an office goer who needs battery backup which lasts more than 24 hours, my M21 outperform there. With easily operative blue light filter mode this does not give any strain on my eyes even when I use continuously for more than 2 hours. It is the safest gadget to be used by my children to save their tender eyes.All Samsung M21 mobiles are manufactured in India only which gives me a pride.In a Nutshell:1. Has 6000 mAH monster battery for one and half daylong performance2. Super Smooth Android 10 with One UI3. Very Powerful exynos 9611 processor4.

Hope this does not create a bigger issue.2) The curved grip is slippery, if you don't hold the phone properly, you will drop it.3) The box that it came in looks very suspicious, the stickers can easily peel off or put back.

"  Bought this phone for my mother & we are really happy with it. The battery very easily lasts her 2+ days . She mostly uses it for whatsapp, general browsing & YouTube videos. The back camera is really good. It takes about 3 hours to a full charge & a lot of people complain about its slow charging speed but thats fine as a 6000mah battery at 50% is almost equivalent to any 3000mah phone. The built quality is very decent & the OS is smooth as butter. Love this one by samsung as I wanted to avoid redmi phones for their shady advertisements OS. Would recommend this whole heartedly!

  Not at all acceptable Camera output from Samsung when they charge higher prices than others.Trust me my Vivo V9 Pro with main camera 13+2mp & front 12mp camera produced far better images than this M21's 48mpI also have Realme5pro - 48mp camera phone - and I just cant imagine to compare its photos with M21's.I seen 100s of videos on YouTube which shows M21 vs M31 camera comparison - and most of they said M21 & M31 produce 95% same results. Thank God I didn't wasted more 2k on M31 if it was to give the same photos.( I decided to buy a NON CHINESE BRAND - so bought M21 - though I know this mobile's 90% parts would hvae been from China üòÇ)Strictly NO for M21 if you want nice camera results.on the top it takes 2+ hours to charge 100% from 15-20%. (thanks to 15W slow Fast charger in this price)Other good points -Battery is big so obviously it will last long ( and anyway you will not going to use camera much so it will save more battery üòú)LED display and touch is smooth - as you expect from Samsung.UI is clean and simple,0.9595,positive

"  A very good phone at this budget. You may get some fancy specs at same price from Mi or any other chinese manufacturer but the differentiating factors are screen, battery & camera.  Samsung AMOLED screens are the best in phones. You simply can't get a better screen from any other vendor. You only can compare with another samsung phone.  Battery of 6000 mah last sa min of 2 days even for a heavy user. Camera is very good. Face unlock works very well.  Only cons i experienced was that with all the gear like case and temper glass it looked a bit bulky. But larger screens have become a norm and that's manageable to me.",0.9139,positive

"  My previous device was Asus Zenfone Max Pro M1. By the time I bought this, Realme 7 was launched on flash, which in anyone's first look would be the best favourite in 15k range of smartphones. I never wanted to buy a Chinese made UI phone, the same reason why I bought Max Pro M1 more than 2yrs ago. Not because of this fake nationalism media furore, but because I genuinely care about my privacy. I always appreciate true Android OS experience, with the freedom to control my apps and settings. Why I'm writing about these things? Let's see.1. Samsung Galaxy M21 comes with its One UI 2.0, which has been recently updated to 2.1 with some camera improvements. It offers exactly same freedom to control app's permissions, check individual battery usage, use themes and feels better than the cheaper looking MiUI and RealmeUI.2. It comes with Samsung Max VPN function and I'm quite content with it. It saves me a lot of resources to not invest in a VPN subscription. However, it's slow and makes the browsing experience sluggish - story of every VPN ever existed. Still it's okay from privacy p.o.v.Now coming to the device's performance and features, I do not think I need to write much about it after 6 months of this device launch. I will simply post a 1-10 rating for each perspective.Performance: 7 (Occasional hiccups)Display: 9 (You already know about this)Ergonomics: 9 (Don't believe those saying its design looks outdated)Memory: 8 (in terms of multitasking)OS/Software: 9Rear camera: 7Front camera: 8Video capture: 8Battery: 10 (You might have already seen this coming, Gives me 10-12h screen usage)Miscellaneous - Face unlock & Fingerprint sensor: 9, Audio output from speaker: 7, Bluetooth connectivity: 7, WiFi reception: 9, Call through earpiece: 8, Body material: 6 (for using such a slippery plastic back), Heat dissipation: 4 out of 10The major issue I had handling this phone was due to this getting heated on the upper side of display, most probably due to a bad conductor of heat at its back. I haven't played a single game and I've stopped playing games on a phone long ago, so it's just the many shopping, social media apps and browsers that I multitask between. I ordered a flip cover along with the phone since AMOLEDs are thin glass, needs care while handling, but I couldn't use this phone with the flip more than a day! The upper part of display was heating up like a metal kept in sun. Such heating systems can permanently harm the motherboard and battery elements inside, along with your ears if you take calls at such times. I have also used my friend's Galaxy M20 and even that outdated device with 3GB RAM or so and a bad processor has better heat management.It gets mildly heated while keeping in the pocket, while charging, while multitasking a lot between social media and content downloading apps, every now and then even though I'm not a rough or heavy user. My screen usage a day stays within 6-9 hrs. I returned the flip and ordered a soft plastic back cover with a fabric design (You can get it at 149 from Amazon, it has holes on the back for air venting) but even that couldn't make it through more than 10 days of usage. Initially, it was handling heating fine but after a few days I again noticed similar heating issue. I returned it again and now I have ordered a plastic case, which simply holds it on edges and open on the buttons side and upper and bottom sides, hopefully for better ventilation. Doing fine since laat 2 days of use, but this doesn't provide any protection to display. It's just that I happen to be very cautious while handling my gadgets so I know it will survive for years in my hands. I never encountered such heating issues in my Asus Max Pro M1 with a metal back and rugged cover over it, even during heavy gaming and multitasking. It was there but on very rare occasions though. I have seen Samsung India responding to reviews here so, take a Note, Samsung.Verdict: I'm posting this on 2nd Oct, and I think still looking at the competition of the kind of products in this range, M21 is a good buy. If you can manage with the heating issue, which if you use with a partially-open back cover (the one in pic) or without any cover at all, won't be there. I wanted a phone I don't need to run for a charger every now & then, it checks that point quite well.Leave a Like to this review if you think this helped you choose a better option.

"  I bought it for my brother @12699 on 24 May 2020So, I will list the most practical things I like about this device.* I personally care more about the screen of a device, be it mobile, Laptop or computer monitor. As whatever you consume, it comes through that screen only. AMOLED screen make the visual experience so much rich, plus it consumes lesser battery from a already monstrous one. This is the main reason for me to go for this device. I would always recommend anyone to pickup an AMOLED screen over a LCD one* Bloatware free Android distribution, as good as Android one stock. No ads like you will find many in Chinese Handset. If I have to gift a mobile to my family member. I pick android one or a equivalent clean OS device, like this one.* Most intuitive UI in android, Samsung's One UI. (Yes, you must get hands-on with Samsung's one UI device toexperience it). The way they have made it possible for users to navigate to the items with single hand is what even Google couldn't do after so many years. That too, when phone screen sizes are 6.x inches nowadays. The UI is very responsive and day to day experience is glitch free* This devices comes with a big battery and with 6.4 inches screen and phone doesn't feel bulky. Also, battery compartment, you don't even need any review for that. Backup of 2.5 days under normal usage very much possible* Great camera for your day-to-day moments. Night mode really makes a difference. Can capture and see lightning at 240fps, the same thing I do on my much expensive Galaxy S9* Feature rich phone. Video editor, Photo editor, movie maker are out of the box from Samsung itself. Very useful app which people often download from unreliable third party vendors**********Some downsides************ Not for heavy gamers. However, PUBG is possible in HD settings, if you can play it in India ;)* Today, you might get a 90Hz display at this price. But again, if I have to pick between refresh rate and AMOLED, I personally will pick AMOLED* 15 W fast charging. Needed more W's for a 6000mah battery*********Who all can look for this device***********************Anyone who cares for rich visual experience, rich media consumption, casual gaming, forget to charge their device, need good camera and most important good value of their money.",0.9949,positive

"  Reviewing it after using for more than 10 days. Samsung galaxy M21 is very handy and classic looking mobile and light weight as well even though having huge mah battery.Features like 48 MP excellent camera, super amoled display, and 6000 mah huge battery in this price range is considerable. Processor is also great ( You can Play PUBG, COD smoothly) though Snapdragon processor is obviously better than Exynos for games. I loved the display most. Fingerprint reader is fast no issues at all. Other supplimentry features are also useful, no ads like Redmi mobiles show. Camera is far better than other mobiles in this price range and most attractive features is 'Night Mode'. Battery life is more than one and half day to 2 days depending on uses. Only thing I didn't not like that with 6000mah battery Samsung giving 15 Watt charger, very strange thing. No other issues I noticed like lagging, heating etc.So finally my conclusion is that if u are a normal user(not a gamer) and want a super amoled display, good camera, huge battery and good looking mobile then this is a perfect mobile for you in this price segment.",0.9934,positive
"  My first non-chinese smartphone.üòÄ( In fact Matter of pride for me).Good product but Samsung need to do some more QC about fit and finish(however improvement over M30s).Lack few features compare to counterparts(Gorilla Glass 5, metal/GG5(not my favorite) back cover) but has some exclusive great additions too (sAmoled, 6000 mAH). So it's a give and take. However one can not compete with those who are known tech. thieves.Comes with lot of uninstallable bloatware(Facebook/Netflix/MS cloud to name a few).A daily data counter (usages info.) in notification drawer and a icon to lock screen display is a necessary inclusion Samsung must think about.Processor is good contrary to general belief. Can handle some pretty heavy apps which SD 636 (RN5P) couldn't handle with same memory config.( PS:I am not a Gamer).Overall impressed. My next phone will also be a Samsung when my other phone(RN8P) completes its threshold.Will update my review once return period is over/ after a month's use)And Samsung please care to add a cheap plastic cover and screen protector. Will be life saver till one buys a good one.",0.9902,positive
"  Writing the review after usage of 40 daysPros1. Awesome battery life, lasts up to 48 hrs of decent usage.2. Super amoled display makes visuals more crispy in indoors.3. Camera hardware is good, camera software of Samsung requires update.. overall a good camera.Ultra wide angle is really wonderful. Front camera is decent.4. Processor is good, with 6 GB RAM hardly any lag in using multiple applications simultaneously.5. Samsung UI is lighter than miui and certainly holds all the features like coloros or miui.6. Preinstalled apps hold about 17 GB in phone and rest abt 103 GB available for usage.Cons1. Battery takes about 160 mins to charge fully with fast charger.2. Screen is prone to scratches , a screen guard is must.3. Back cover is needed as the back is all plastic and gets scratches even inside the cover due to small dust particles... Should have a glass back panel as well.4. Fingerprint sensor takes some time , and difficult to sense if your fingers are moist.OverallValue for money, a good option of you are looking for a non Chinese phone with decent configuration and don't have a budget for an iPhone.",0.9746,positive

"  It's been over a month since I have been using the phone.Camera : Camera performance is not that great. Don't expect any exceptional performance. I find camera of Poco F1 was great when compared. Overall gives a decent performance. Don't pick if you are buying phone just because of camera.Battery: Battery performance is excellent. Initially It struggled to last even one day but then I removed a lot of pre-installed apps and the performance increased. It would last for a day for a heavy user (not gamings all the time Ofcourse, but social apps).Ram/Performance:I do have plenty of apps, yet it works smooth.This phone comes up with a lot of preloaded apps, you may remove some but won't be able uninstall all apps (e.g. Netflix).Overall it's a decent deal at the price coming from Samsung.",0.5723,positive

"  Samsung Galaxy M21 is the best budget smartphone, the display is outstanding, performance is stable, OneUI is highly optimized, the battery is amazing (I read some negative comments, but honestly I didn't face any such issue. It lasted 2 days for me on moderate use.), Fast charging not too fast but better for longer battery life, too fast charging kills the battery faster.Overall it is the recommended smartphone to all the budget users. If you are planning to just heavy game on it then this is not for you.",0.9041,positive
"  Cons:1. Despite 6000 mAh battery it hardly gives 1 day backup when using for calls only. But taking 3hrs to full charge.2. I noticed twice SIM card not detected.3. Sometimes finger print scanner doesn't work.4. Image/Video quality is not good when using wide angle sensor and video stabilization.5. Sound quality is not up to the mark.7. Polycarbonate metal quality looks like cheap.Pros:1. Awesome display.2. UI is also good.I think I got defective mobile, overall I'm not satisfied with this mobile, return requested, will get replacement. I will post my reviews once I use replaced unit.",-0.0147,negative
"  Superb smartphone,i purchased Samsung smartphones only bcoz i dont wanna purchase any Chinese smartphon.boycott Chinese products.Nice smartphone with big battery & good camera.Samsung should introduce there smartphones some other powerful processor like Snapdragon 720G,730G.other all things are good like it comes with super amoled display and ,6000 mah power full battery although if samsung could provide atleast 20 watt charger instead of 15 watt than it will be good. By the way nice phone.i purchased 64gb internal,4gb ram Variant at 13500 rps  now its price has been increased l.now this is available at 14000 for 4gb ram,64 gb internal Variant.samsung should not increase the price.",0.9786,positive

Was using A 50 from last 2 years which has far better user performance.",0.5859,positive
"  Awesome monster by Samsung. I love this piece with all superb features. With all great features, the following are the pros and cons of the device as I found out.Pros:1. Samsung Hardware Quality! Always exceptional. I remember using my Samsung Galaxy S3 i9300. I still have it and I can match the quality of M21 with that of S3. The price is also reasonable given the features. Could be a bit low.2. Huge 6.4"" Super Amoled screen with >92% screen ratio and 1080x2340 pixels resolution is awesome. Colours and resolution is very good.3. 48 MP camera comes with awesome features like slow motion, super slow motion, time lapse, portrait, food photography, night,  panorama, and pro mode. It also includes qr code scanner and bixby vision. Video quality is also awesome. Front selfie camera is also excellent with self capture features by palm gesture. Front camera is also used for face recognition for unlocking the phone, which is again an excellent feature. Tripke camera have wide mode, depth mode and normal mode.4. Battery: 6000 mAH Lithium Polymer battery gives a monsterous backup. Even though, if you use all the features of the phone, the battery will stay for the whole day long. 15 Watt quick charging enables you to quick charge the phone and use it for the day long.5. Processor, Storage and Ram: I've bought the 6GB 128GB version,  which has sufficient storage memory and RAM to copeup with your rigourous use, let it be games, videos or applications. The monster never slows down. Samsung Exynos 9611 Octacore processor is superb. Mali G72 MP3 GPU lets you play your favourite games with more fun!6. Software: The Android 10 with One UI 2.0 is an excellent combination making the phone literally your virtual assistant. Samsung Galaxy apps are added advantages apart from the hardware quality!7. Phone is light weight and slim, though long due to its screen size, bit its neccessary for a better viewing experience.8. Loud speaker is good. Headphones support Dolby Atmos, and customizable sound profile to give you an amazing sound effect using headphones.9. Other features include USB Type C, A-GPS with Glonass and BDS, Fingerprint sensor, accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass, dual 4G LTE standby (Good for Jio users!), Screen cast inbuilt and dual sim support with seperate memory card ecpansion slot with 512 GB card support.10. Most important: Its Made in India! :)Now the Cons:1. Most needed these days is the NFC support for digital payments. Does not have NFC.2. No Earphones in the box (Samsung provides one of the best headphones). Though @Samsung says that headphones are user specific, but still I would say headphones must be included, as they are one of the best.In all, to summarize I would say that it is definitely a go for a great price of 15k for 6GB 128GB model. Great purchase with excellent features. I love my this monster.. 9.8/10.. Definitely go for it..",0.9975,positive
  My S10 screen went faulty after 9 months of purchase and it being the lockdown period all service centers were closed. I needed a good phone as I'm a trainer and my work depends on it. I've been a Samsung buyer for years now and so I chose the higher version M21 as a compromise. However to my surprise it did everything that my S10 could and had a better battery backup as compared to the S10. The only things it didn't have were fancy features like DEX and wireless charging. Functionally a better phone and much more useful than an S10. So I bought another lower end one for my elderly mother so that she could watch programs on OTT platforms and use WhatsApp without worrying about the battery draining out and also enjoy the decently big screen size which is enough to watch movies and play games. It's a good phone in the price range and everytime I feel like fixing my S10 screen I push off the thought 'cos I could get another M21 at the repair cost. It's a good purchase add against considering a Chinese phone at around the same price. Close your eyes and buy an M21 whether you're looking for a first or second or third phone.,0.9775,positive
"  10-09-2020I am one of the loyal customers of Amazon from last 6-7 years. Right from daily needs to washing machine I have purchased from Amazon. I am shocked this time to experience the fraud amazon have done. As mentioned in my review dated 03-09-2020, the samsung-21 phone I bought was having major issue of volume. Hence, I opted for replacement. To which I got notification that, replacement is possible only after 9-9-2020. As per the instructions today when I again wanted to opt for replacement the window says, ‚ÄúRETURN WINDOW CLOSED ON 9TH‚Äù. This is complete intentional fraud with customer.03-09-2020So I purchased Samsung because I wanted to buy Indian product. But very disheartening to inform that I have received faulty product. At full volume, I am unable to hear anything. I am trying to listen WhatsApp messages with headphones on which is hardly audible & also continuously getting notification sound from background which is not of my phone.I am at loss to understand how such major fault have been ignored by Quality Assurance Team.

"  If you are planning to buy midrange phone with 13k to 14k then go for this, Camera quality awesome 4 ratings out of 5. 5 out 5 for battery life. Everything is goof in this phone except taking long time to charged phone(2.5 hr for 0 to 100% charging). If you are soft use then mobile battery will discharge in 2 days. which is almost better quality than other mid-range phone. Processor also fine with respect to RAM and Internal memory so no lag while playing Heavy games or application.

"  First I want to say about the processor which is I think AI based giving sufficient performance to do your daily job but you're a gamer who's playing non stop gaming without giving rest the device not this is not for you sorry. The UI given here gives lot of freedom to edit yourself like a superuser. The hardware and the software perfectly optimise as every things hands on samsung. Battery life as it mentioned Monster. I here about network issue which I faced also in my jio sim but if you perfectly in network setting then you can see the network mode is by default set in LTE/3G/2G (auto connected) which is the problem if you don't change to LTE only, because jio has only 4G network support and it doesn't have any 3G and 2G network, when the device fell that the LTE signal is become weaker then it automatically changes the network to lower suitable one, so I suggest the user who have this type of issue and using 4G sim then change the setting to LTE only. You'll get a great superb camera.I did't like the built quality where the company did price cutting for giving a AMOLED display which gets easily scratch by your surrounding recommendation to use case and temper glass as immediately you buy the product. Charging speed is too slower as compare to huge battery which is ok. Only i missing here is network speed indicator which can be resolve by a third party app but every company giving this one but samsung..?? hope they will update that one in next update .Finally best in this budget but company should provide case with the mobile.",0.9957,positive
"  I had been using this for last one week and here are my feedback:PROS:1. Best thing is the UI. Almost like the standard Android UI2. No unnecessary apps. Even if there few pre-installed apps but it allows to uninstall them3. Battery life is good. With normal usage it is giving me backup of around 2 days(100% to 9%)4. Charging time: It takes around 2hours for 10% to 100%5. Camera: It is ok, but not something like 48mp6. No Heating problems7. Face recognitionis fine. It even recognizes in complete darkness8. Both the SIM slots are Volte enabledCONS:1. Headphone socket is at the bottom of the phone. This matters when you are using headphone but cannot place it anywhere as the headphone is connected from the bottom of the handset2. Charger Cable length is short as compared to other brands3. Settings: I struggled a lot to turn-off the vibration for notifications (final solution- we have to turn it off for each of the apps one by one)Based on these, the weightage of Pros is more than Cons. So, we can go for this product :)",0.8841,positive

"  hello , this was my first smartphone from amazon.. i have never used an android phone before, i ordered this  phone, samsung galaxy M21 on sale last month in august only, initially i clicked pics with the phone and the picture quality was pretty good but when i clicked the same pics with flash on, there was a blue tiny in the pics.. i thought may be its because of some lighting effect  but later i tried clicking pics in day light, at night.. indoor, outdoor. but still i faced the same issue, i had been to the service center they said camera is faulty. but they cannot exchange the phone. though they can repair it.. i'm skeptical will the camera work properly after repair or may for sometime it will work and who knows later the issue will be there again? also there is problem in speaker and microphone! voice is not clear while talking.Now who will take the responsibility, they must check the product before selling..overall this purchase was a waste of moneysamsung is a good brand but they should take the responsibility if customer is facing issue, the customer service at the service center is worst! i didnt see a single happy customer over there who have got a good resolution!",-0.7432,negative
"  Had read here in most of the other reviews that the phone has severe heating issues and sincerely hoped that this wouldn't be the case with my device. Here's my review:1. Looks and feels like a mid- to high-end device. A bit slippery, so you might have to get a back/flip cover2. Chose this for my mom due to its low SAR rating, a few people had pointed out that this resulted in low network strength. This has not been the case for my device. Network strength remains unchanged from the previous handset3. Battery life remains its biggest plus point. Lasts more than a day easily with moderate to heavy usage. For a day or two, the battery doesn't seem like it is 6000 mAH. However in about 4-5 days, it adapts itself and there is a considerable difference and one can see that it lasts longer.4. Low to Moderate heating issues. My mother prefers a flip cover anyways, so that is easily masked in this case.5. Camera quality is above average. Make sure to change the settings to highest quality images. The default setting is for low quality. This has caused a lot of people to comment that the image quality is poor.6. The resolution is perfect and bezels remain as low as possible. Its the closest you can get to highest resolution in this phone range.7. Chose the 4gb/64 gb variant due to negligible gaming needs. For now, that serves the purpose perfectly. There's no lag during browsing or app change as such.8. Samsung device, so no hassles with bloatware that comes pre added with the like sof Xiaomi or Oppo or Vivo.All in all, a very decent mid-range device that should last for 2-3 years, which is the normal life of a cell-phone these days.",0.954,positive
"  Phone is good!There is an issue when merging conference call. It will hang the calls on hold and you have to disconnect all the calls. Camera nothing great. Battery is very good. Fast charging and normal charging time almost the same. Finger print reader does not work if your finger is sweat. Lot of blotwares on software update. Latest software update was 1 GB and it consists of Payu money app and other blotware apps. Recomending to factory reset and uninstall all those blotwares. Some blotware apps are not allowed to uninstall so just have to disable it manually. Samsung keyboard simply refuses to show sometimes even if I am in typing mode, microphone gives echo effect to the receivers when I make calls, chrome app hangs, wifi both 2.4 ghz and 5ghz tends to disconnect internet automatically if your signal strength is low. Even if we have dual sim capability on this phone, recommended to use one sim because the performace of your phone in terms of network and hardware features will be very limited when you are using duel sim",0.2259,positive

"  I purchased Samsung M21 a month ago and I'm simply impressed with its performance.Battery:The battery capacity of 6000 mah is highly reliable and last for 1.5 days with a full charge and 100% data on. The phone reaches 100% charge from 1% in about 90 minutes and once fully charged, you are on for a marathon.Camera:I was personally impressed with the camera performance. In the budget of Rs. 14,000, I by far would rate Samsung M21 as one of the best phones available in the market. Apart from Triple camera, the phone comes up with multiple camera features that would certainly engage the user.Speed and Performance:The speed of the phone is really good and does not slow down even if you open 10 applications at the same time. With 64 GB inbuilt memory expandable upto 512 GB ensures your phone is always available to load more. The seamless experience with video calls, messages and Business applications like MS teams, Outlook, Office, etc make the phone fit the Business segment.Overall, just go for Samsung M21 if you are looking for performance, features and price worthy.",0.9732,positive

  Well I feel bad while writing this review but the phone is not up to the expectation. Battery drains out relatively quickly and takes a bit of time to get fully charged. The fingerprint reader is good and sensitive. The camera is of decent quality and you can click clear images with it. Samsung can seriously work on UI improvements. It feels that I am using outdated UI. To be honest I ordered it only because I did not want to order Chinese phone. Overall 3 star rating from my end.,0.8729,positive
"  It is a good option for normal users. But don't buy these mobile for gaming. Gaming is not bad But we are playing high graphical games like pubg, call of duty, it may be lags.

Battery is good but dont seems to be a 6000mah it drains like 5000 mah. Fast charging is not good it would take 2.45 hrs to charge 0% to100%. Design is not good it is plastic design which was dont look like premium.When you are a heavy gamer than you go for realme 6.when your preference is camera and design go for redmi note 9 pro.

"  Well this phone, the screen, the battery, the camera and every hardware aspect is way good at this price. I just love watching videos on this screen; on a single day use, I don't need to charge it, even for once and the camera is good. I'm using this for two months and there is this issue about VoLTE. The VoLTE sign often stops showing, sometimes the connection jumps from LTE to 2G and wouldn't show 4G, unless restarted or the flight mode is switched on and off. At first I thought it was my SIM operator's problem. I called them and they informed it was device's problem. So, I googled it and turns out, a lot many people using various SIM operators are facing the same issue. Although it seems to be software bug and I hope they rectify it with future updates. Also the fingerprint scanner gets smudgy and wouldn't work, often. I don't play games on phones, so I don't how the processor holds on gaming; the user interface is smooth though.",0.7884,positive
"  Review after using 15 days.This phone feels good in hand. Priced at reasonable rate. Screen is good, sound is clear. There are few cons.1) Camera quality is very bad. Back camera is claimed 48 MP but photos in low light are of very poor quality. Selfie camera quality is also very bad. I give only 2 stars for camera because of OS of camera. Better samsung should give less MP with good quality images.2) Video playback is not good. Videos shot on other mobile hangs a lot.Initially I got a problem of very slow charging speed during even fast charge mode. Then Amazon care guided me some trouble shoot and ask to drain full battery and then charging the mobile. This helped and speed of charging improved. But mobile tower signal is low compared to other brand with same network and same place. Also video Play back of stored video is poor.Overall good mobile compared to samsung M30s but not with competitor brands. Only samsung lovers can like this phone.I recommend to go with MI note 8 pro or note 9 pro at this budget.",0.8972,positive

The phone comes with a ton of preloaded apps many of which can be removed though. Both camera set ups, rear and front are nice though. Image comes a little bit warmer in tone. Speaker sound quality is loud and clear. Battery back up is marvelous. Media streaming experience is great. You get Dolby Atmos sound with headphones on. Network reception is great and emhced with WiFi calling.All in all phone is a little bit overpriced, but may be justified by sAMOLED display.",0.959,positive

At any point of time you would have 1.2/4 GB available with basic apps installed. The response from the phone on app launch/navigation is pretty decent, neither it's very fast nor is it very slow.Camera: The camera quality is very competitive in this segment. No complaints here.Sensors : Face Recognition is a bit slow but fingerprint recognition is fast.Screen: The screen is awesome.

"  Writing this review after using the phone for 45 days.This is my first samsung phone.Utterly disappointed by the performance. Did go through the reviews before buying the phone where I found some mixed answers.i guess I should not have overlooked people's concerns which they posted here.so here I go with what I have been facing ever since I bought it.1) battery takes 2.5 hours to completely charge.so don't go by the mentioned spec fast charging ..phones back in 2010 also did not take 2.5 hours to completely charge.2)phone's width makes it look ugly..after putting tampered glass and back cover,it will look extra thick.3)frequent lagging.4)by any chance if you are a pubg gamer ,this phone is definitely not for u.heats up in one match and lags like hell.pubg runs 10 times better in my old moto g5,Nokia 6.1 and realme c2.5)camera quality is average.you won't get 48 mp feeling for sure..6)the only good thing about the phone is it's finger print senser.Kindly consider these points before u think of buying this phone..",0.789,positive
"  It's almost 3 months since I got this monster at 12.5k. I'll mention the Pros. & Cons.:-PROS1. A good brand at a reasonable price.2. Amazing camera for daily users.3. Battery backup is more than good.4. Ergonomically designed, so easy to hold in  hands.5. Dolby Atmos Integrated.CONS.1. Battery backup not as expected from a  6000mAh battery.2. Phone speed drastically decreased by 20-  25% after 10-12 days of usage.3. A 14watt fast charger is provided which  takes around 3 hours to juice up from 0-  100% & it's too much. (I would rather prefer  a fast charging phone over big battery size)4. A poly carb. back cover looks cheap.Conclusion-- The only thing that makes me happy after buying this device is, this is not a chinese brand. The performance is average. If you are looking for a better performance, please go for Redmi.",0.9604,positive
  I am using this phone from last one week. This  is the best budget phone under 15k.It has huge battery. It last for one and half day with moderate usage. three times my old phoneI am normal user. Camera is good as well.  Only one problem is it takes time to full recharge 3 hours from 0 - 100% but that is something we can adjust atleast I am not going for chinese phone.,0.5994,positive
"  Processor  is not a good one. Hangs a lot. While shooting  video screen gets extremely  hot... camera  could be more better.In this phone only screen quality  and battery  life is good rest is not justifying  its price. I WOULD SAY THATIt could be priced10000 rupees.Don't  buy if you have a heavy  usage, even if you don't  play  game. I won't  work for a quality  game  play. It gets hanged and hot. Not able to play videos properly  after shoot....It's good for normal average  usage not good for the technical  people.",0.0813,positive
"  Hi I am now using this phone for last one month. So I feel like reviewing it.1st fingerprint scanner= it's good but I truly don't feel that wow feeling while using it even sometimes don't respond on 1st attempts but it also may be for dust sometimes so 4 star.2nd battery life= it easily give u 24 hours battery life from 95%-20% but it doesn't give u feel like 6000 mah battery feeling feel like around 4000 mah. That's why I'll give 3.53rd camera quality = don't going to pixel ppi factors in detail but simply when i click a photo in  bright condition it gives a rich photo looks good detailing also not bad but yes nothing extraordinary but and video is also decent yeah slightly lacks stability. So I'll give 44th heating issue= yes it has if u use it for streaming around  2 hrs constantly it heats up but frankly most of mid range smartphones heats up at least from my last 6 yrs experience I can say that but yes snapdragon would have performed little better in this case.I'm not a gamer so I cant share that experience.In short, I must say I'm quite a happy buyer because overall performance according to my necessity it performs well. above mentioned points are just device's pros and cons.",0.9935,positive
"  Awesome budget friendly smartphone from Samsung.1.Best display in this range AMOLED is far better than LCDs. A ""U"" cutout AMOLED is better than a punch hole LCD. The software takes full advantage of AMOLED in dark mode. Perfect display for binge watchers.2.Performance is good enough for a normal user (not a Gamer). The phone heats up on gaming far easier than its counterparts. So not a performance issue for most of the users.3.Coming to battery life this beast can last up to 2 days for a casual user. Giving upto 11hours of on screen time. Even with over 5 hours of zoom calls daily zoom calls plus the causal usage one cannot kill this phone in a day. So nice for students looking for a battery beast to last full day of online classes.4. This phone does not live upto to its competitors in the camera department. Sure it has a 48MP primary lens, but the photos come out over saturated and struggle in low light conditions. But give it enough natural light and it pics come out pretty good.5. Software: this field is unbeatable in case of Samsung's ONE UI 2.0 one of the best custom skins over the already good enough Android 10. Not a fan of Samsung's apps but sometimes of them like Samsung calender, clock , calculator are better than the Google alternatives. Also as the phone will get 2 major software updates till android 12 it is a future proof beast.That's all so overall I will give this smartphone a 9.8/10 for checking all the necessary boxes for a good smartphone at this price range.‚úåÔ∏è",0.9911,positive
"  I was using Redmi note 6 PRO for almost 1 year, and I Bought M21 in Exchange offer in Amazon,  The exchange Offer is Awesome, I dont think any Local Retailer would be able to give the Same Exchange amount as Amazon.After 1 week of Usage, I feel the Phone is Pretty good for the Day to day Basic functions.  I would like to compare it with my Redmi note 6 PRO.Performance Wise, I thought the Redmi note 6 was Slightly Better, but I dont see Significant difference between Redmi and M21.  Overall the performance of the Phone is decent for the price you pay.I am not Fan of Games, and I cant comment on Performance of the phone while you Play Games, But I think it cannot be used for Playing Games such as PUBG.The Redmi note 6 PRO has 4000maH battery,whilst M21 has 6000maH,  However I see that the battery life Both Phones were almost the same with Moderage Usage.  This was very Disappointing on M21 as 6000maH Battery was the highlight of the Phone, and One would expect more Battery life on M21. Sadly thats the not the case.I am not saying battery Life is bad, You would get the same life which you get on any Phone that has 4000MaH, However thats not what you expect from 6000maH Battery.One Important thing I would like to mention about M21 is that, all notitifications works pretty Weel on M21.  Its not only with M21, but with all Samsung Phones for that matter. I am talking about the Apps such Outlook, Skype for Business etc.  The Notifications for skype Never works on Redmi, for Outlook it works someties, and sometimes it doesnt.  But It has been working fine with all my official apps on M21.  It may not be relevant to everyone, but for a person who keeps checking their phone for their Outlook and skype messages, it matters a Lot.  I have also noted the same Issue with Other Apps on Redmi Phone. If you guys are familiar with Mygate, I never used to get E-intercomm Call on MyGate ( This was the same on Redmi and also my RealME ( MyWife's Phone).  I would say, when it comes to User interface and User experience Samsung defeats all other Chines Made Phones which are available in the market.Another Point I want to add is that, I have Samsung Galaxy Ear Buds which I was using it with Redmi Phone, and it never used to work. I used to face frequent voice cut with the earphone, but now with Galaxy it works like a Charm.  The Galaxy Ear Buds is designed for only Galaxy Phones.  In case anyone is planning to buy it, get it only if you have a Samsung, else it will be a waste of Money.",0.8636,positive

"  I got my M21 on 21M (21st May). Been using it since and it's been brilliant.Pros:Amazing displayGreat cameras for day light and ample artificial light photosGreat battery (even though it isn't optimized yet, it's giving great backup)Good RAM managementFeature packedCons:Bad low light photosAll in all, a great phone at the price. Couldn't have asked for more.Edit- after more than a month of using:The battery life is amazing - its providing me 12-13 hours of screen on time with more than 2 days of moderate use.Camera is amazing: Bokeh effect, ultra wide photography, pro modes etc are working perfectly fine - can even compare them to my old oneplus phone. The only problem is low light photos - they are bad.Display and screen quality is top notch.",0.956,positive
"  What I didn't like is-1) when I received the package, the box inside outer plastic package and bubble wrap was torn, its sticker which prevents the box from opening was also torn.I thought I would have to return the product (I have also took video of opening), but then thought about giving a benifit of doubt and switched on the phone, to my surprise the Android was starting up for the first time. So I kept the phone.If I keep this incidence aside, I would have given a five star rating.2) because of the big screen to body ratio, it is hard to hold the phone without activating any functions near the screen edges.Pros-1) first time after old Nokia feature phone days I am charging the phone only twice a week.2) Super AMOLED display is really crisp and efficient3) smooth running, smooth charging4) no heating up.5) good camera features.",0.8123,positive
"  This device is great for handling daily tasks smoothly and you can do gaming also. But you can't play high end games like pubg for long time. I mean, you can play pubg in this smartphone but only for shorter time like 30 minutes at full battery then it will start lagging very much. You can't  play competitively. At the end, if you want a gaming smartphone don't  buy it but if you want a good smartphone as a daily driver you can go for it without a second thought. It's battery, screen quality and software optimisation makes it a very good smartphone in this price range.",0.9573,positive
"  I wanted to try samsung make the very first time and bought this mobile phone, overall found the battery backup and display quality good. did not face any call related issues either voice or data. But speaker phone seems to be off a bit, faced issues conversing when on speaker. I can see clear panel gaps with screen not properly sticked to the below panel which I never faced in this price range of 13k when compared with Mi or Xiaomi. Did not want to replace it due to hassle process of replacement and all. overall an ok-ok phone.",0.6145,positive
"  Everybody would have provided review.Phone is great. I have received it today so will update more after use.The most important thing to note is - Preloaded apps which couldn't be uninstalled or deleted.  Unfortunately this is problem in lots of custom ui phones.I hope Samsung listen to buyers and atleast give features to uninstall these app.For instance I don't want Facebook app on my phone, I don't want so many irritating app from Samsung but I have to keep it in my phone.@Samsung please take this feedback. Otherwise you are great. That one star less on rating is because of preloaded apps.",0.8669,positive
"  I am writing this product review after using it for almost 12 days. First thing you will like about this device is its super AMOLED display, its the best quality display out there. The build quality is just fine it comes with gorilla glass 3 protection but its better to put on a case and a glass screen protector to avoid any scratches,  believe me you don't want to scratch that beautiful super amoled display. Samsung UI is better with no ads. The phone is very well optimized. It cleans the junk files and frees up  ram and storage by itself every day at midnight. The processor handles every day task quite easily, doesn't have any heating issues. It has a massive 6000mah battery which generally takes 2 to 2&half hrs for charging with the 15Watt fast charger bundled inside the box. The battery can easily give you 1& half day of usage (ie 9-10hrs of screen on time). Initially it calliberates the battery usage and charging speed so don't get worried. Ram management is done nicely, i was surprised to see a YouTube video start from where I left the night before. Little things to like about this device are Samsung keyboard,  Samsung switch, cleaner UI etc. Audio from the headphone is quite impressive, it has the Dolby Atmos Audio effects. Haven't spent much time on camera yet but during my brief exposure i find it working fine, shutter speed is fast, quickly saves the images and has different shooting modes (night, pro, food, super slo mo, hyperlapse AR emoji etc). Image quality is fine and well detailed. A lot of people have complained about its network reception  issues but I  can assure you the network reception is just fine. Actually if you switch from certain chinese phones you will notice a slight network drop but Samsung has optimized the phone to emit less radiation (have low SAR value) which are against the ethics of chinese manufacturers.  If you notice any network issues then contact your network operator to solve the issue, i was Initially facing some troubles in internet connectivity on my BSNL 3g network which was finally solved by the network operator. There is no issues with the phone. Final verdict- You cannot find any other made in India phone with such features in this price range There is either Samsung Galaxy M21/ M31. So just go for it. I am glad that I again switched to Samsung after a brief experience with my Realme device.",0.9975,positive
"  I bought this product in INR 13999 and I am writing this review after use of 1 month.Following are the best features of this phone I liked:-1. 6000mAh battery:I keep wifi turned ON whole day & watch videos on mobile. Still my phone battery never drained to 50% mark in 24hrs.On normal day, it drains to 70% mark in 24hrs. When I used it heavily, it drained max upto 56% mark in 24hrs.2. 15W type C chargingCharging is quite quick compared to older phone chargers.3. DisplaysAMOLED is quite cool. If you watch video at night in quite dark, you will feel like your watch in Cinema Hall.Experience is quite well compared to older IPS screens. It does not hurt your eyes in dark.4. SoundSound is rich. Call/Music sound quality is very good. Plus ""Dolby Atmos"" sound system is there for more effects.5. Camera QualityQuality is good and includes all the latest features like wide angle, super depth, night vision etc. Selfi quality is quite good.6. In-built Caller IDI detects spam calls quite accurately. You will not need to depend on TrueCaller kind of apps if you use them only to detect if incoming unknown number is Spam or not.7. AI used in One UI 2.0Time to time, you will experience that they have used AI to help you use some settings effectively.It has many other good features but I enlisted those which really make it Stand Out in a crowd of smartphones for me.I ensure you will not regret buying this one.",0.963,positive
"  I'm in love with this phone. I think its the best in its segment i.e. the below 15k mark. The sAmoled display is just superb and is worth the money. The super large battery is good but the charger is slow (a little). Tge camera quality is mind-blowing and captures crisp and clear photos. The front camera is super good too. The processor is just a little less powerful than of its competitors, good for low to moderate gaming. It does a fabulous job in day-to-day tasks and will not lag. Highly recommended. And one more thing you might get confused in between realme 6i and m21. I too got confused but if you are a gamer and don't care for your privacy go for realme 6i. But if you are a normal user who wants to surf net, get crisp quality photos, get a wonderful sAmoled display. Go for M21 without any hesitation. Best in its segment.",0.9775,positive

"  Great Camera, excellent screen and superb battery. Dont go for any chinese phone like Redmi note 9 or Realme 6i etc, please compare online this phone has better rating than any Chinese phone and is similarly priced plus Samsung dont do petty tactics of stocking out and flash sale concept to boost sales, a good product doesnt need such gimmicks anyways. Chinese phones show better config on paper but they use such low quality items that they dont last 1 year also. Camera may be 60 80 or may be 108mp but after 6 months they produce such low quality image that phone will become useless. These issues are not there in case of samsung, plus samsung phone hangs a lot is a old theory which chinese company brought to make a hold and are not true.

"  Order on 4th July 2020, and received on 11th July 2020. The product was in good original condition without any transportation issues. Here are some pros and cons I experienced.Pros:1. Good and sturdy feel. Though not required, still got tempered glass and of course a rubberized back case.2. The big RAM (6 GB) is really handy since most of the time the system consumes about 50-60% of the memory i.e. about 3 GB or more. So, the system doesn't show any lag.3. Large storage of 128 GB is also quite useful in the long run. After update from my earlier mobile, i have about 35% storage consumed. Only about 70 GB is remaining out of about 112 GB that is available for use. I have not yet transferred the photos/video from older phone which would be about 25 GB. So, this 128 GB is very useful.4. Camera: I find it to take extremely good pictures. May not be of professional or even semi-professional level. Still good enough to capture moments in life in good quality pictures. The video quality with zoom and google meet for video conferencing, meetings and for giving lectures is much better than all the cameras (mobiles, laptop etc.) that we have. Even in low light, the picture/video quality is very good.Cons:1. The screen sometimes flickers. This problem had been pointed out by earlier buyers also.2. Occasionally, the systems seems to be a bit slow to screen touches. I have not yet fully optimized as per my requirements in the sense that stopping unwanted apps from getting loaded or keep running in the background. Still looking at the specification i.e. processor, memory, graphical processing unit (GPU)  and storage such lags is not expected.3. Ultra slow motion video: This could have been better. I am not able to capture ultra slow motion videos for more than a second or so. Either I couldn't find the proper settings or the mobile doesn't have.4. Battery: I haven't done a thorough testing about the batteries. This are only views based on observations for last 3 weeks. One of the primary reason to buy this product was its battery which is rated at 5800 mAh (and not really 6000 mAh as they advertise). However, the battery backup I didn't find it to be much less may be around 5000 mAh. My Honor 8 (2016 model) with 4000 mAh gives similar backup.Overall, I find this product to be worth buying and has rated 4 out of 5.",0.9621,positive

"  Samsung makes excellent phones with AMOLED screen that people love to use. The processor and touch response is buttery smooth. Everyday tasks are a breeze. The phone has all the bells and whistles including compass, FM radio, Dolby Atmos, low SAR etc and with the Always On Display (AOD) has superseded the ‚Äúanalogue‚Äù notification light.This phone is a super replacement for non trustworthy Chinese phones. Finally, the fingerprint sensor is lightning fast and its humongous battery is an added advantage.

"  If you often use mobile internet on a laptop/desktop via mobile hotspot, do not even think of considering this mobile phone since it doesn't support 5ghz bandwidth, in fact, most of the Samsung phones, even in the higher range such as s9 do not have 5ghz hotspot either. If you're using this phone as a mobile hotspot, I can guarantee that you'll be frustrated in the 1st 10 minutes.  Nothing about this phone is exceptional except for maybe it's battery. The camera & performance are below average, see comparisons on youtube with other phones of the same price range i.e note 9 pro. Now, I'm not advocating for Chinese products, but the NOTE 9 PRO, performs way better than this heavy piece of sheer nonsense. I bought this phone as an act of patriotism since I did not want to buy the Xiomi note 9 pro, as it's chinese product but I am truly disappointed by my decision. P.S Samsung provides the same 5ghz mobile hotspot service in their devices being sold in China & Korea. You can google each and everything that I said in this review to check the authenticity of the information. I highly recommend not buying this phone.",0.2564,positive
"  My opinion on Samsung Galaxy M21 based on my previous 1 month of usage.I‚Äôm going to divide this review between pros and cons.PROS:-1. BATTERY: the battery life is unbelievable! On my usage it even went to day 3 without charging while I had always on display and mobile data turned on every time apart from general usage. I also used the hotspot to connect my mac. Still it went smoothly. Also, despite it‚Äôs huge 6000mAh battery phone doesn‚Äôt seem bulky.2. DISPLAY: the AMOLED panel is very bright, crisp and vibrant. The colour accuracy is also good. Samsung excels when it comes to display anyways.3. CAMERA: considering the price, the camera performance is above average. It takes some decent shots with good background blurring and colour accuracy. The selfie camera is also very good. It takes nice portraits.4. AUDIO: the output through audio jack is good. It has geed clarity and bass is balanced. Neither more nor less.5. HARDWARE: the Exynos 9611 processor handles day-to-day tasks smoothly without being heated up. Thanks to its 10nm processing. I‚Äôm not a gamer but I‚Äôve see seen reviews where it handles games smoothly too. It is accompanied by 4gb DDR4 ram which is good and also UFS2.1 storage which makes the experience even smoother even though the price is so low.6. ONE-UI2.0: the experience is enhanced even more because of the UI. It is smooth, light weight, good looking yet simple and user friendly. Also there are tons of customizable options that helps every phone looks unique.7. NETWORK: there is good cellular reception and I never experienced any network issue whatsoever.CONS:-1. BUILT: thought it has low price but still built quality is not satisfactory. The plastic body in the back panel gets scratched easily. Also, it still has Gorilla glass 3 which seems to be out-dated now.2. SENSORS: the phone lacks compass and ambient light sensors. Though it manages to adjust brightness via front camera which it calls ‚Äòadaptive brightness‚Äô but a dedicated hardware is always a welcome feature.3. SPEAKERS: they are good. But can be better.At a price of 13999/- this phone is sure the best buy. It has AMOLED display which also comes with always on display which make it look pricier than it actually is. Also, this phone is not for hardcore gaming but then, none other phone in this segment can outperform it day-to-day usage. In the end I can say is it has a balanced specs where performance is concerned and adding the huge battery with a good display and oneUI2.0, it becomes the best buy at this price.",0.9971,positive

  I am not a heavy  gamer and I am writing this review after a week .....1)Display : Awesome sAmoled  Display.....If you use this display then you will never buy LCD display phone in your whole life....2)Camera : Best camera in this price range...Check my photos...3)Battery : Big battery with outstanding performance....Even after the heavy usage of YouTube battery percentage was 25% at the end of the day(12pm).....Check my battery usage photo...4)Processor: Processor is decent...I have not faced any issue until now....5)Design : It is good and lightweight phone but you will not get glass back like other Chinese phones...Cons :1) Slow charging: 2.5 hrs for full charge2) No glassback3) Processor is not good for heavy games like Pubg..You can get better processor in this price range....I am super happy after buying this phone...Now it's your choice what do you want...I will update my review in future....,0.9717,positive
  Best mobile phone under this price range and battery life is too good almost 2 days with normal use and 1 day with any kind of rough or heavy use and only problem is it has 6000 mah battery but only supports 15w charging at least 30w would be good because for full charge from 0% to 100% it's taking 2:30hrs to 3:00hrs but it's not bothering me because my old phone was taking around same time with 3000mah so at the same time of charging i am getting double backup. And display is super amoled which is awesome and if you like too much edits in photos so this phone will give you so original and crisp and sharp photos but not as oppo vivo like over edited or cartoon like photos. And processor which is exynos 9611 is performing very good i have played pubg for atleast 2hrs but on HDR mode it was running very smooth and battery backup was awesome means for one game of atleast 30 minutes it was taking 7% of battery and don't play pubg like games for long time like more than 2hrs because it will heat little bit. One thing about battery i want to mention majorly that real power of 6000mah you will be able to see after 7 to 10days of use because new battery like this size requires 7 to 10days of charge discharge cycle to adjust itself. Honestly speaking i am writing this feedback at around 5:30pm and battery is on 72% and my mobile was fully charged at 8am in morning.And one of the best thing is that despite having 6000mah battery it's weight is only 188gm means by handling it you can't believe that 6000mah battery is inside.Please buy back cover and put a screen guard to protect it from scratches.,0.9965,positive

Today they set a appointment with a technician which is 2 days away.Decent battery life. Average camera. Very good finger print reader.

"  I bought the Raven Black, 4GB-64GB variant of the Samsung and I must say I'm impressed with the phone's overall usability. I decided to go for Samsung by considering the brand value and overall specs of the phone. The main requirements for me were - Good display for media consumption, good battery life and a clean and easy to use UI without any unnecessary ads. Since the Galaxy M21 ticks all the right boxes I decided to go for this phone.-The display of the phone is brilliant and is at par with some of the high end phones.-The battery life is also very good and it easily gives 1.5 days backup even under heavy usage. The only complain I have is the length of the charging cable which is very short.- The performance is good too for day to day usage. - The Exynos 9511 is fairly capable and I haven't seen any stutter or lag in UI. If you are ahardcore gamer than I would recommend to look for alternative since it would not perform as good as its competition in regards to gaming. For casual gamers it will do the job well.-The cameras on this phone are brilliant with very good image processing done by Samsung. It takes pictures with natural colours.- The speaker output is average. Its loud enough but the sound produced is nothing impressive since it lacks bass and that clarity in the sound output.- The audio output via the 3.5mm Jack is very good as it supports Dolby Atmos.- The fingerprint sensor is very fast but the face unlock feature is not that consistent as it sometimes fails to read your face.Hence, overall it is a great value package from Samsung and I would highly recommend this phone to everyone looking for a good phone at this price point unless he/she is a heavy gamer. Thanks for reading.The packaging could have been better, there was no bubble wrapping or air pockets around the box for protection against bumps or drops during transit and the packaging was only the Amazon's plastic cover(with a layer of bubble wrapping) which I believe isn't recommend for transportation a smartphone.",0.9912,positive
"  they should have used another proccessor because even though they give 6000mah battery . it also depends on the processor how efficiently the power utilizes as it is an outdated proccessor it dosen't optimize 6000mah compared to other snapdragon proccessor so, i suggest don't fool out with 6000mah because if you compare poco f1 with snapdragon 845 vs this phone both shows same performace in power wise because in poco f1 it optimizes power well compared to this phone. so, 6000mah is for namsake without a good proccessor. so, if anyone wants to take any phone first see its proccessor and then specifications always proccessor must be the first priority",0.7948,positive

"  Before writing the review I want to tell you that I am not a promoter of samsung phones and to be honest I didn't liked the J series at all. But when it comes to this model, samsung has changed each and every bit of it and made this phone a completely different one. I used to watch the reviews of this model and they told that even though the overall performance is good, it is not up to the mark when it comes to gaming. But believe me this one works really well for pubg and there are no problems yet (4GB 64GB). The user interface is absolutely gorgeous. And the SAMOLED screen gives you a tremendous picture quality. The only thing that I am not satisfied about is the 6000 mah battery. I think it is a made up figure. It actually does the same that a 5000 mah can provide. But in overall after using it for last 3 months I can assure you that it is worth for the money. I got it for 12699 which gives me extra satisfaction.",0.9742,positive

"  The phone is a complete package in the price range, I bought the 4gb variant for 12699, since I feel it's better to buy31 rather than going for m21 6gb variant. It's just, 4gb one is better budget oriented.Anyway, will talk about some good points and bad points, since I have used this phone for almost 5 days.So let's get started:-one of the best thing about this phone which might attract the regular Chinese phone buyers towards its is the display. And yeah I can say it's worth it.-camera is nice for the price range I would say, i.e under 13000, but I don't feel under 15000 it's that good. Since u can get other phone with better camera quality.-now coming to the processor...it's bad! But not that bad...it will provide good overall experience, but gaming, it's not made for it.So overall it's a nice phone, and plus I haven't seen any charging issue as well..It gets fully charged around 160mins as claimed by the co.So my final verdict would be if u want a Samsung phone under budget and are not inclined towards gaming that much((don't get me wrong, u can play games, but there are better phones out for that, for maybe even cheaper)), go for it..But again I would recommend u to go for the 4gb variant or if u want 6gb then go for m31...m21 6gb one is not just worth IMO",0.9841,positive

"  One of the main reason for buying this phone was the higher capacity battery and fast charging, but it failed to deliver on the expectation. The so called fast charging takes almost  3.5 hrs to charge from 5 to 100 percent and top of that with normal usage battery doesnt last for 2 days. The auto adjustment of screen brightness is poor, and found it too bright often and have to reduce manually. Camera quality is good. Sound quality of speaker is poor for both ringer as well songs etc. As a samsung product expected it to be better then what was delivered. They have put a lot of hardware but should work on building a system software which utilizes the hardware efficiently. The RAM consumption until now was always excess of 4 gb always, going upto 5 gb with almost minimum apps running in the background. Thanks to system upgrade installed in July end it is now below 4gb for the first time, hopefully they work further on it to enhance the obvious issues and tune up the system overall soon.",0.9517,positive

"  I like this phone very much.It has huge battery that last whole day easily under heavy usage. But note that charging fully takes easily around 3.5 hours which is not problem overnight.Phone is quick in reaction and I'm really sensitive about reaction speeds... So I'm happy. Rarely during browsing it lags but I think it is due to browser error and conectivity. On paper some competitors have faster cpu, but in practice I doubt there is much difference... Unless you do games...Speaker sound is ok, though not great.Microphone sound is ok according to callee.Camera is ok, although I'm not a photographer...Usb port works as otg (I can connect my usb flash drive through cable reduction and it works fine).OLED dispaly is super nice, I much prefer over LCD.What is really plus is this phone has antenna bands suitable for both india and europe. Chinease competitors like redmi does not have both bands in one phone.What is minus is there is no NFC.Also rounded dispaly is terrible for fitting any screen protector. If you are super good you have just small reduction on sides after installing screen protector :( You can used to it, but I'm pissed that samsung does such shitty impractical display design...Also for using there is one potential unpleasant thing - samsung has no protection to activate phone in your pocket. There is proximity sensor but it is ignored. If you have phone in your pocket and by mistake touch fingerprints sensor it can be unlocled and anything could be pressed in your pocket...Anyway over all best value phone.

"  Writing it after using this phone for a week. Considering the price i did not have much hope, but still it was able to disappoint me. This was my second Samsung phone after 7 years,My experience:-1. 6000 mah battery is for the name sake. With normal internet usage and watching couple of clips it goes to 50%.2. The Camera is an utter disappointment. Its not that i was hoping it to be like a high end phone. But its really bad. They hv put lots of features in it and all are below average. Also, it is slow. It takes a considerable number of clicks to flip from front to back camera and vice versa.3. The RAM is of 4 GB which should be good for a new phone running apps one by one, but it flickers and sometimes crashes.My suggestion?:- Please skip it if you can. If you want to buy it for older family members who are just into calling, go for cheaper one than this. At least you would save some money.",0.6196,positive
"  I use a single phone, with high usage of data transmission and data storage, and I also travel a fair deal. So my review may be more relevant for similar users.1. The phone battery goes on and on. Nearly never empties, except when I did not charge for 2 days. Normally, at night it is around 50% and I charge it back to 100%. This is really useful for travel in future, even if currently travel is restricted due to covid.2.  The camera does very competent job of still and videos. I am not a photo expert, so cannot comment on technical complexities there.3. I chose 128GB storage and 6GB RAM. While 64GB / 4GB would have been enough, regular upgrades of Android over next 2-3 years of this phones expected life may need more memory and having more storage also helps in keeping multiple email accounts and also music, pictures, ebooks etc,, without having to worry about phone slowing down due to lack of free space.4. THe display is very sharp and i have not found any difficulty in using it during day or night.5. Response time: The phone is very responsive, far more than the M30 which I used earlier. It has never kept me waiting.6. Connectivity seems very good - have not faced difficulty in wifi, bluetooth connects and also using as hotspot.7. I have two  - 4G SIM cards from different operators - and both work in 4G mode. Older phones allowed only one of the SIMs to work in 4G mode.Suggestion:1.

Packaging was good.Just open up the box, have few recommendation before getting in phone, where Samsung has to improve.1. Expected a Mobile case inbuilt which was missing.2. Warranty card, sorry paper is available. Hope we can claim using invoice with samsung.3. Charger cable was too short, mere 60 cm - shocker to me with such small cable.4. Big bulky charger with 15w fast charging.5. Too many bloatwares by Samsung, moment connected wifi configured downloading many apps. Need to uninstall one by one.6. Plastic back panel, makes mobile alike cheaper product, ahead of good configuration.7. Display is good and 4k wallpapers are so crystal clear along few videos in youtube.8. Approx 24~ gb occupied by default configuration. 102gb user able to use.9. 4k videos playing from youtube are great and treat to watch.10. Neat and elegant design in width, compact in hand with 7.5cm width, which was alligned like 1+ 7t11. No option to resize icons by default system configuration. Very average icon style, rather poor I can say.12. No earphones with kit. Not even basic.13. Smart switch helped to transfer apps and media/files. Missed to transfer system settings.We have to wait and watch to justify if the mobile meets expectations.",0.9727,positive
"  Hello everyoneYou can fully trust on this reviewIts my experience have been using this phone for 2 monthsI hav bought this phone 2 months agoAnd i think now i should review thisI'm not technical personBut i will say my experience with this phoneCamera quality, battery, look everything is good average not excellent but ok..I dnt have complaint of themBut worst thing is soundVery very slowYou cant heard voice during callYou have yo press phone yo your ears yo here voiceSame thing is with media sound.Very slowI hate this thing abt this phoneI'm not satisfied with this purchaseI  suggest everyone to not buy this phone",-0.9455,negative
  It is value for money product for me. The best part is it's screen which is too good. The camera and performance is also good. Maybe the Chinese phones have a better processor or ram at this price but I don't mind paying a slight more for a non-chinese phone.Would always prefer to buy Samsung phones for their quality. Hope Samsung bring such budget phones with competitive specifications and pricing.,0.9072,positive

"  Neil Armstrong, ""That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.""i don't take much time, directly review about my Raven Black M21(6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)...Pros:1) the 6000 mah battery totally scam. At first day of receive,it charge upto 83% only in 6 hours and not exceeding(which gave me hard shock). And now after using a week it charge 100% in 2 hours(yes,please read again).Thanks to C type charge. You have to give time to your phone set with charger at initial stage, after that it will surprise you. Even in night phone consumes only 1% and from 100% to 5% it takes 3.5 days to degrade.2) other reviewers(on this or other site) say that M21 is only for non gamer, but i say use it as I install NFS no limit, WGT golf etc. big game and it work completely fine. All thanks to its upgraded android system, best processor and chipset.3) Best quality triple camera with limited best option like Panorama, pro,food,night,slomo, hyperlapse etc.,which i personally like as it will not lag my system configuration.4) Best in era, in todays corona budgetary world with money saving.5) i surely say samsung strong step towards AI tech in medium range phones will help people to upgrade themselves.Cons:1) i concerned about long last life of plastic back cover given, as ""samsung family"" of my house all members uses samsung phones which lasted at least 6 years and still in working condition.2) cons or not, but this time samsung does not give Earphones. Which i like the most compare to other brands. And also omit sample cover for phone.About first line,in my words,""That's one small step for samsung, one giant leap of mankind to AI.""",0.9943,positive
"  am writing my review after using it for 6 days.I have bought sumsung phone after 7 years hoping it could be good phone but samsung again disappointed me a lot.They claim it has 6000mAH battery but drain like 3000mAH and it take almost 2.30hrs to charge from 10% to 90% so its fast charging is not a fast charging. Its just a market gimic to clail it monester like features i.e.battery 6000mAH ,15W fast charge ete but reality is far far away from claims.Others features are as per price range but if you thinking for a battery packed phone with fast charge,then I would sugget plz search for others phone in same range.",0.6858,positive

What kind of os tunning is that, that too after I have heard a lot about One OS...!!! Oh SAMSUNG! Furthermore, brightness is an issue in direct sunlight, and also in dark room... speaker sound is also an issue.. AND LAST BUT NOT THE LEAST, Network has a grave issue...!!! This phone is like a room with AC, Fridge, large LED Tv, but has a leakage in the roof...!!! Aghust.... Now on 12.07.2020- Amazon is showing its main 48mp camera as a f1.8 camera. But that is wrong. Its main camera is f2.0 aperture. Anyone can check it on Samsung website or anywhere else wherever they can. I don't know why Amazon are misleading.... The question goes to Amazon too... why???",0.7168,positive
  This is a ausome phone under 15k but i will not revomend this device for gaming as it heqts in just 5 to 20 min .. and also the battery is not good at all .. rather it is 6000 mah but but exhausts from 100% to 30% in just  5 hours during online class which is not a heavey usage ... so it is ausome but if u are in good battery  i will suggeat to buy redmj note 9 pro and if u are in gaming then i woild suggest to buy realme 6 or Samsung a50s .. also i face some statures and lahs also sometime .. The screen is not so flient but the vamera is very nice ...,0.4991,positive
"  I bought this phone with great expectation and I must say it does stand up to its claim, the display is good, speakers are fine, camera is cool and the phone isn't that heavy though it has a 6000maH battery. HOWEVER I am a bit skeptical of the battery. It offers a monster battery and despite not being a a heavy nor even a moderate gamer, my battery life doesn't look promising. with the medium power saver mode on, I'm just managing to make it function for around 24 hours. Which would include maximum 3 hours of Netflix/Prime. I don't know if it's the best the phone offers, but since the highlight factor of the phone was the battery, i must say it isn't upto my expectation, despite not playing any PubG or other games.",0.8634,positive
"  Too much heating issue, It overheats when you use it, It also overheats anytime randomly even if it is in your pocket.I had to visit Samsung service center, 1 hour after receiving the device. Service center refused to help because I purchased the mobile from Amazon. Amazon refused to return product, Instead they sent replacement after inspection. This is the first time I am feeling sorry to shop from Amazon. 6000mAh battery doesn't last for single day with no gaming, no video streaming and very modest use.The battery drains because of heating. Once used navigation in my Car and had to switch it off after 30 minutes due to over heating....its a safety risk.Tomorrow, I will get replacement mobile and sell it to a shop on Rs2000 less. Will buy other mobile from that shop.I wouldn't recommend this product. I wanted to buy a non China phone but looks like Samsung trying to ride on anti China sentiments and make profits, compromising on quality and safety.Worst thing....Amazon now does not protect interests of its customers. Will never buy Mobiles, tablets or laptops from Amazon08/10/2020: Amazon agreed to return and refund",0.7143,positive
  STPL has been sending defective phones this is my 3rd phone from same vendor. Amazon is doing nothing and now that I've crossed 10 days i can't return. Phone calls are not going through and some times gets disconnected. I've done all factory reset and tried new sim. Damn I feel ashamed of purchased this from amazon that too from same vendor. I didn't have option to choose another vendor. Amazon has deserted me lifted up its hands,-0.6808,negative
"  Before I go into details, let me admit that I was a staunch ""hater"" of Samsung Android phones, specially in the low mid range. The first and last Samsung phone I used was a Galaxy Core, back in 2012. I absolutely hated it, and promised to never buy a Samsung phone ever. But then there was an ad and I purchased this M21.. Samsung again, after 8 years. And during these 8 years, I have used Sony Xperia, Moto G, Redmi 4, Redmi Note 7 Pro. So my review is actually a comparison of those phones with this beast.The major advantage of this phone, compared to my Moto G, is the brilliant sAmoled display with Full HD resolution (not 720p, thank God).Processor is so optimised for this phone that it works like a breeze and stays cool like, unlike my both Redmi's. I dont bother the fact that its not a Snapdragon. Performance and usability is so much optimised that you shall never complain.Battery backup is a perfect two day affair, for more than normal usage. Screen on time is excellent. I can easily go through 2 days even after streaming web series and talking a lot on phone calls.The only thing that bothered me is the finger print sensor. Its not a feather touch one, definitely. But it still works pretty good, once you put your finger on inlt properly.For me, its a very good deal under 15k. Would recommend this to anyone, even when blind folded!",0.9947,positive
"  Was a Nokia fan, Post their debacle moved on as Motorola fan, for last 5 years. Did take s chance to buy a Galaxy M10s last year, for my family.

"  Atleast you should have given basic screen guard and transparent phone cover. Now Samsung has even stopped giving earphones along with their phones. Adapter is so slow that it takes  atleast 6 hours to get charged, plus battery back up is not as per expectation. And charging your phone in 8 hrs really sucks. And the only thing they took money for is 6gb ram, 128 gb internal. Please don't buy this product. It is a complete burden",-0.5709,negative

"  Battery: Takes more than 2 Hr to charge fully due to huge battery capacity. Once fully charged, lasts for more than 24 Hr even after 6 hr of extensive use.Camera: Day light pics are awesome but pixels get distorted when image is zoomed even if it's set to 48 megapixel. Image size is huge if 48 megapixel setting is used. In dark room image and selfie are sufficently good with flash. Different aspect ratios available in setting to cover desired witdh and range.Display: Butturly smooth touch. Clarity of content is awesome. Blue light filter option with option to manage opacity is available in quick drop down menu.Sound: DecentUSB wire lenght: 0.5 MTR only. Too small.Pre-installed apps.: Amazon, Netflix, Microsoft  office, different apps of Samsung including samsung store etc. And some Chines apps. It's better to uninstall useless apps on very first day.SIM: Both sim slot support simultaneous LTE facility.Ear phone slot provided at bottom beside charging port.Weight: Light as compared to size.Dual Masaanger facility allow us to active two what's app account simultaneously.No earphone provided.Conclusion: In such a price, lots of good feature provided by this Made in India phone. For regular use, this phone can be choosen.",0.9845,positive
"  I have been a long term Xperia, HTC and Moto user. Consider that this review is from a non Samsung guy who doesn't want to buy a non branded smartphone.Pros :1. Excellent display - The best I have used in the last few years.2. Good battery - Non gaming person will end his day easily with 20% charge still left.3. UI - Could have been more cleaner but bloatware can either be uninstalled or disabled.4. System - Has call recording and various customization features by default which my earlier phones lacked.5. Camera - Could rate it 3.5 out of 5. Takes good photos but lacks 60fps video recording.  So camera rating is not a pro not a con.Cons :1. Design - Plastic body, non premium look, slippery design, fingerprint magnet.2. Charging - Takes 3 hours to charge from 0 to 100%.3. Fingerprint - I feel the positioning of fingerprint sensor is not at the correct place.4. Sensor - It uses front camera as light sensor for auto brightness, hence drains lot of battery until adaptive brightness is turned off.",0.9436,positive

Slowmo flickers when taken indoor.Overall phone is the best you can get at this price or even under 20k range.

"  Not Happy with Amazon for this purchase.Faulty product delivered.Just after one month, Screen is on but not responding at all. Samsung service centre has told it is showing water damage!There were no water damage chances at my place for last one month, and I am pretty sure this damage is more older.Actually the water damage is even before the ordering thru Amazon, this handset already had water in it.I know that company will not take responsibility now and that is the reason I am surely going to report this fraud to everyone.Samsung is still a Fraud !Hope that Amazon helps here!",-0.2244,negative
"  After three months of extensive usage, I am quite satisfied with the overall performance of this phone. Both the front and back cameras click crystal-clear pictures. The AMOLED display is good, and the battery backup is quite efficient.But the only negative point that needs to be brought to notice of the company is a minor heating issue. Whenever I open the camera, the upper portion of the phone heats up quickly, making it seem quite dangerous.To sum it up, this is a good phone in this budget that anyone can choose to buy.",0.6361,positive
"  Glad that samsung launched the best phone under 15k segment. Contains no annoying, and vulgar ads as present in chinese company phones.

"  REVIEW AFTER USAGE OF 2 MONTHS.Varient: 128gbCamera: The back camera clicks great photos even in low light. The colour and depth of photos perfect. The front camera is also better than average.Battery: The time taken to charge is about 2 and half hours( because its a large battery 6000 mah). With average usage (i.e without gaming), it lasts almost 1 day 20 hours. I used the phone for watching videos and accessing tutorial.Fingerprint: Its quick and accurate. Before this i used a MI handset. The fingerprint sensor is better than previous one.Heating problem: Its gets heated with heavy usage. Pretty normal with average budget phones,i guess.Processor: The phone is fast and works smoothly. Switches like a butter between multiple applications.Look and feel: It fits great on the hand. Looks decent. It has a good grip, doesn't slip from hand.Its the best choice under 15k. I'm really happy with my handset. Samsung doesn't disappoint.",0.9884,positive
"  Writing this after one month of use. Overall handset is claiming to have all the features for a budget phone. But I'm not so satisfied with its performance. Camera images quality is not so ""wow"". Worst problem I'm facing with network connectivity, regular network and mobile data. Issues like no network, voice breaking, call drops, delay in connecting call. I'm not getting signals at any places inside my house which was not so problematic with my previous phone redmi note 5 pro. Battery is good, since it is new phone.",-0.4585,negative
"  Box contents-Device, user manuals, sim card ejector needle, adapter and charging cable.The cable is bit small. Could have been longer.First impression-Felt it slightly heavier than its siblings probably because of huge battery. It's worth it, considering the battery performance.Display-New shiny blue body toy with huge full screen display and water drop notch. Looks fabulous. Amazing crisp clear display with punchy colors(although the colors are bit too punchy sometimes, especially primary colors) and built in dark mode and blue light filter (to be swited on manually)Display is pretty snappy, refresh rate is pretty fast in this segment.Camera-Triple cam with 48mp, wide angle works better than Samsung M30. Camera module is main attraction of the phone. Looks neat.Finger print reader is quite fast, and opens up in milliseconds.Overall it's amazing package for the budget definately recommended.Samsung is giving tough competition to chinese brands.",0.9837,positive

I exchanged a old Redmi 5A and final offer price I got was 13k which is a great deal.The phone is from a South Korean based company and it gives amazing battery life with that 6000mah capacity. Excellent full HD superAMOLED screen panel. Triple sim slot. Option for choosing 2g, 3g, 4g network separately. Decent camera performance and smooth Samsung OneUI. The processor is not that amazing but the same Exynos 9611 is used from phones ranging 13k to 25k models by Samsung so its a good choice for M21.

It's made of plastic but looks good with skin. And finally the exynos 9611 is now pretty old and not good.

"  I bought the midnight blue, 4GB-64GB variant of the Samsung Galaxy M21 for myself. I'm impressed with the phone's overall usability. Since i am not a heavy user unlike others, I decided to go for Samsung by considering the brand value and overall specs of the phone. The main requirements for me- Good display for media consumption, good battery life and a clean and easy to use UI without any unnecessary ads. Since the Galaxy M21 ticks all the right boxes I decided to go for this phone. Moreover i was using a Samsung Mobile prior to this and hence i was accustomed with the functionality of the UI.-The display of the phone is brilliant and at par with the Amoled display of my Redmi K20 Pro.-The battery life is also very good and it easily gives 1.5 days backup even under heavy usage. The only complain I have is the length of the charging cable which is very short.- The performance is good too for day to day usage. The Exynos 9611 is fairly capable and I haven't seen any stutter or lag in UI. If you are ahardcore gamer than I would recommend to look for alternative since it would not perform as good as its competition in regards to gaming. For casual gamers it will do the job well.-The cameras on this phone are brilliant with very good image processing done by Samsung. It takes pictures with natural colours.- The speaker output is average. Its loud enough but the sound produced is nothing impressive since it lacks bass and that clarity in the sound output.- The audio output via the 3.5mm Jack is very good as it supports Dolby Atmos.- The fingerprint sensor is very fast but the face unlock feature is not that consistent as it sometimes fails to read your face.Hence, overall it is a great value package from Samsung and I would highly recommend this phone to everyone looking for a good phone at this price point unless he/she is a heavy gamer.

"  Bought this product after comparing the specs. To be Frank after receiving the phone ita a let down.1. The wifi connectivity has problem, reported to Amazon replacement is on the way.2. Bluetooth connection it takes exactly 132 seconds for the phone to detect and connect to an already paired bluetooth device which happens in other handsets in a matter of seconds.3. It boasts of 6 GB ram checked the memory first and it shows 3 gb of 6 gb available with 550 reserved for existing apps. Mind it this is on the first inspection even before installing any apps from play store.4. Phone gets stuck and has lags which is not expected from a brand new phone.5. Battery after two days use it's normal and drains quickly mind it I could install much dueto  the wifi issue it give can hour or two more than 4000 Mah battery and nothing more.6. My choice came to Samsung phone coz of the drive not to buy a Chinese brand Xiomi but in comparison to their note 8 pro the M21 fades away in terms of speed,quality and the overall performance.7.

"  I was bit hesitant to buy Samsung Galaxy M-21. The reason being I was more interested in compact designs and small size phones. I used to have MI phones for the same reasons. But first time, I switched to Samsung and believe me I am more than satisfied.First and foremost thing, the big battery. Once charged, it is lasting for three whole days!  (on a medium use).  I check social networks, emails, messages regularly though don't call much. I am not a gamer too. But still 3 long days battery is worthy. Further, no battery heating issues on charging unlike with MI phones.Secondly, the AMOLED display. It is vivid, bright and sharp.Next comes the Camera. I read previews that the camera quality was so so. But look at the shots taken by me using Live Focus feature. The pics will speak for themselves.About performance, no issues... smooth and slick.I feel it brilliantly falls in  Value for Money category with Made in India tag.",0.906,positive

Asus not available online, Nokia has very limited battery and reviews not great.I generally like Samsung build quality, and now it is made in India, so decided to go with this.Its decent enough, good phone.  May not be value for money though considering the spec with other chinese brands.But good build quality, and comes with Android 10 / On UI.  So far getting patch updates regularly.Battery may not be as impressive as it claims.

"  I have decided to put my review after 1.5 months of usage, I opted samsung only for a single reason that it's a non chinese brand..Now, talking about the performance of the phone, so far this comes out to be a good phone on all the parameters and there are no lags in the phone.. Camera quality is satisfactory and good with fair details, both front and back cameras will give close to natural colored pics, one should not expect DSLR in 14000 bucks..Battery back up is decent, you will get one full day i.e.24 hrs back up if you are heavy user, with moderate use u will get little over 30-32 hrs of back upFingerprint sensor is not very fast and prompt but it serves the purpose very wellProcessor who cares about whether its snapdragon or exynos, all hyped created by online reviewers, if you are a normal user and dont play heavy games you will not be able to figure out the difference between the two processors and this processor works fine and gives good performance in daily usage with no lagsScreen is super Amoled which is the USP of this phone at 14000 bucks, picture quality is good and colour contrast is also quite punchy..I dont think any other company provides the S Amoled display at this price range, I have compared the picture resolution of M21 with one plus 7 and there is a difference of 19-20  only  and do consider the pricing as well while comparing this phone with a phone having  price of more than 36000 more than double the price of this phone , so that ways this is bang on..Audio quality is good with ear phonesCall reception, network connectivity works fine with no lagsAreas of improvement-No LED  indicators which is quite disappointing at this priceLooks and build quality is not that good, quite simple with no glass back Charging takes 2.5 hours to fully charge the phoneGo for non chinese product with very little compromise over looksGo for this non chinese brand over chinese phone and you will not regret ur choiceI did a lot of research before purchasing this one.. so samsung M21 overall offers a good package with outstanding picture quality and color contrastIn case you find this helpful in your decision making, do like this review.",0.9907,positive

"  Writing this review after around 15 days of extensive use.1) Battery: Battery life is the best in this budget. Once charged, backup is atleast 1.75 complete days. It takes around 2.5 hours to charge this gigantic battery with the in-box 15 watt charger.2) Camera: Well comparing with other phones in this price range, this is simply the best. Also, Samsung Galaxy M31 is also a good option, but didn't find any difference between this two when I compared the images.3) Processor: Both the GPU and CPU are decent enough. Not a PubG fan, but to test it once, I ran a few rounds of PugG and Fifa Mobile. Didn't lag even once.4) Overall Texture Quality: Body is made of plastic. This could've been better if it was single metallic body. The rear look is not so great, but anyways you can always cover it with Back covers of your choice.Overall Rating : 4.5/5Cons:1) They should've given 20 Watts charger, as it takes 2.5 hours with the current charger to fully charge it from 0 - 100%.",0.5504,positive
"  This is the best Smartphone under 15K . Don't even think twice... just go for it.Pros:1. Best Display:  FHD+ super amoled display is far better than IPS display. If you start using it , you will never like any IPS lcd phone. Colours are very attractive in super amoled. Nowadays I feel IPS lcd displays dull.2. 6000mah battery lasts more than one day even after heavy usage .3. Camera is best in daytime. Even night mode is better than any phone under 15k. So, you won't be disappointed on camera.4. Samsung One UI is clean and ad free. There you won't be disturbed by ads . Nowadays Chinese phones show full of ads. Samsung is great by this way.5. THIS IS NON-CHINESE! This makes m21 more safe and secure.6. Exynos 9611 is not a bad processor as YouTube reviewers says. It can handle high graphics game in high settings .7. The camera has some great features like colour pic...Main object remains colourful while background becames black&white(watch the image). This looks great!... so onCons:1. There is no earphone or backcase. Company should give atleast backcover.2. Length of cable is short.3. Exynos processors are not very good for playing  long time. Still you can play PUBg  4-5 hrs but Mobile heats up a little .Final verdict: If you have a budget less than 15k, you should buy this. This is better than Chinese phones. Don't listen to YouTube reviewers,  Chinese companies pays them for promotion.  M21 is better than any phone at this price!",0.9905,positive
"  Overall a good phone - 6k MAH battery with 6GB, 128GB in 15k + 500 for accessories is not that bad.Battery lasts 24+ hours with wifi ON continuously.Looks good, sleek and stylish. But with cover, every phone looks ugly and bulky, same goes here as well.Camera configuration appears very high but it failed to impress me so far. Didnt find it very great.Speakers - it sounds little cacophonous.  It feels like it has only 2 volume settings, same low for first 50% and same loud for remaining 50%, nothing in between.  And it doesnt appear to give any sound effects, sounds something odd compared to my previous  phone.After the OS upgrade, realised that whatsapp or messenger calls do not show up on the screen, it only rings. So I have to first open WhatsApp and then tap the top of screen to get options to pick up. Not sure whether it's an issue with phone OS or WhatsApp, Messenger. Since, with earlier phone as well, I had issues with these two services where it wouldn't even ring at my side unless I have opened them. But the caller would hear the phone buzzing. Here, at least it rings.All in all, depending on your usage, feature that matters to you, make your purchase decision.And yes, the box says its ""Made In India"" so you may want to forego some of the drawbacks I mentioned above.

"  Overall, the phone is quite a decent one. It has amazing battery life and a wonderful AMOLED screen. But these are the only things that can be considered above average.What really dissappointed me is the camera quality. The photos taken in good lighting are really great, but those in moderate light suffer. Low light photographs suffer the most as they are abysmal. You can use open camera with noise reduction to get somewhat better quality. Which tells you that it's Samsung itself that are limiting the output of a certainly good camera hardware setup.Moving on to the fingerprint sensor. It's fine. It's fast when it works, but you need to cover it completely with your fingertips, which annoys me. Other phones, and older ones too, in this price range have a much better fingerprint sensor.The processor is powerful enough for daily tasks. That's it. Samsung seems to have just one processor. It's so stupid that they put Exynos 9611 in every phone these days. You cannot play games that well. I tried Asphalt at default settings and there was lag and frame drops. I do not game much, so it's fine for me.The speaker is not sufficiently loud.I like Samsungs OneUI. It is clean and well optimised. I say this coming from MIUI11. What I do miss is the network speed option in the status bar and the three finger screenshot gesture, which were available in MIUI.The 6000mAh battery is the highlight of this phone. The downside is the charging speed. But that's OK for me. The phone lasts 1.5 to 2 days based on your usage.Finally the screen. It is something I have no complaints about. Bright, punchy and great for media consumption. The screen was a major factor for me to buy this phone.",0.9863,positive

"  Hello guys . This is Anubhab . I am basically a tech friendly guy. So I want here an there to find a perfect phone for me. And also I made tech videos in bengali. Anubhab' Tech.At first I describe the feeling when I got it into the hand. The mobile gives you a reliable feeling at first. It is because of Samsung brand. When you boot your phone the UI gives you a clean and clear look with no blotwares or ads. Which you gets in other Chinese smartphone. It is basically runs on One UI and andriod 10.After that it comes to camera Samsung's camera is too good. Various types of mode is available here on video recording, like slow mo ,super slow mo, steady mode etc. 48 mp camera tooks a very detailed pictures. And front is also good . But you get 4:3 frame in 48 mp as usually like other mobiles too.Then comes the battery . It is a 6000 mah monster battery. It canes with 15 watt charger which complete your charging at least 2 hours to 2.30 hours. I recommend you to turn on airplane mode while charging. This thing will fast your charging speed. Display is quite impressive . Super amoled dispay drains battery lesser. Biometrics. The fingerprint sensor is fast but face unlock is slightly less fast. But it doesn't matter.Gameplay: I play pubg in Hdr and ultra frame rate . The game play is slightly laggy. But if you play it with HD and Ulta frame rate it will perform smooth .

Only thing is the best in this mobile is that the camera and screen quality.volume buttons are bit higher to reach. one most important features is missing from this mobile is capturing the screen shot, no shortcut key in quick panel, as samsung should think about this, traditional screen shot system is there, press and hold the volume down and power key simultaneously.",-0.6219,negative

"  A nice phone regarding the price, brand and usage objecives. Certainly not a phone for Heavy Camera users or Heavy Gamers as the camera unit starts to heat the top side of front screen as soon as you start the camera and the rise is rapid and as for gaming processor issues. But if your uses are like me i.e. watsapp, facebook, google, WPS Office etc then this phone is awesome.The fingerprint reader is fast when it reads, but the slightest of dust or sweaty fingers and the reader just goes bye bye, but overall reliable. The battery surely is humongous and the backup shows. 2 days is no issue. As for camera quality the images are fine no issues as such just that there is heating issue. As soon as you start the camera the top side of front screen starts to heat, and keeps heating gradually and after the camera is turned of the temperature comes down gradually.I bought the phone because I wanted a no frills calling, browsing and social media device with lots of space and big battery. Plus the issue of privacy also was important for me. Samsung just felt relaiable then the chinese brands.",0.8074,positive
  M21 is an average phone with nothing special about it. Everything about it is average.

The Battery is Much efficient, Each % gives about 10 mins of Screen Time.2. Processor : Except for Gaming, It won't Lag in your Daily Usage. Excellent Response time.3. Display: The Only Reason of me Buying this Device was SAMOLED Display. If you haven't used Amoled yet, Go Experience it now.4. UI : One UI is is like butter + Samsung gives you soo much control over device including Native VPN, APPLOCK etc.Charging: People are whining for 15W charging, Believe me its more than Enought. This phone will give you 2 days battery on a Moderate Usage, So you charging this once in two days for 2 Hours is Equal to a Your Friend Charging his Twice in 2 days for 1+1 Hour.Cons: Since I am Not a Gamer, Haven't Found any Cons in Phone. But yeh Plastic Back is a Fingerprint  Magnet and is prone to Damage so I suggest you go for Ringke Cover for (Rs. 899). You don't wan't to give 9K for Amoled Display so invest in BackCover.*Gamers, Stay Away, Not for you.*For-Photography LoversBig Battery LoversUI loversand SpeciallyEntertainment (Movies/Videos/Music) Lovers.Update: Camera App Lags when you try to close it. It clicks Blank/Black Pictures Many times.  Battery is Superb.",0.702,positive
  Worst phone with this high price. I am patriot so did not purchase Chinese phone but this samsung phone can not be replacement of even MI low budget phones. Camera quality is not as good as 48mp should be and can not talk with anyone on speaker mode ( too much low volume). Will never recommend anyone to buy this phone with hard earned money.,-0.922,negative
  Not recommendedThis phone is full of specs + best non Chinese phone under 15000But it's software is not that goodPROS1) CameraCamera is awesome. No need to wait for camera to focus on the object.Lots of camera mode available in the camera app.2) DisplayThe sAMOLED screen is awesome. The blue light filter is awesome. FHD+ resolution is good. The screen feels smooth but ruined after using the screen guard. You get an option for increasing sensitivity.3) UIOne UI 2.0 is full of pros and cons.It packed with Antivirus software.(McAfee)But some features are reduced from original one UI 2.0,0.8126,positive
"  Battery : Battery is good and gives an adequate performance.Processor :  I didn't found any lag in my day to day usage. I am not gamer but it fulfills all my daily tasks without any lag.Display : It is just beautiful and looks extra ordinarycharging : charging takes around 3 hours to get fully charged but that is ok for 6000 maH battery and in the current budget. one can keep adding the budget if he is keen to increase the features.Samsung UI : Samsung comes with some bloatwares which can either be uninstalled or disabled but the UI is good and contains lot of additional features.Sound : Atmos is supported through headphones which gives pleasant experience and speakers are loud enough. Can be slow for the Chinese phone users.Final Verdict : For a normal user who wants a beautiful display , powerful battery and a non Chinese phones to avoid the spyware on your activities then this phone is great phone in budget.",0.9924,positive
  A great smart phone...Nothing to say about its display...fingerprint scanner is fast but i must say that the face unlocking is a little bit slow...battery is really 'Watta Monster'...15 watt first charging with USB type C is not bad...it takes about 2 and half hour to get completely charged (0 to 100%)...and drainage of battery depends on usage...but light usage of the phone  can run it for almost 2 days...camera quality is great and the selfies are quite good and sharp...video quality is also good and the noise cancelling mic is also doing a good job...sound is obviously loud but not as good as expected ...but in terms of gaming like pubg mobile or Call of Duty mobile I found it lagging sometimes but not much.This smartphone is not for gaming but it is for students who needs to do online classes as it has a monster battery...and also for its sAmoles display...I also chose it as a student...If you are a student then go for it...,0.9493,positive
"  Liked It for some reasons‚Ä¶.1.The Galaxy M21 is a smartphone that offers a massive 6,000mAh battery.2.It‚Äôs got a great AMOLED display with HD streaming support .3.This smartphone is extremely lightweight.Thanks to the glossy nature of the plastic, the phone is very susceptible to fingerprints.4.The 48-megapixel main sensor on the Galaxy M21 is excellent. With sufficient lighting, the pixel-binned photos came out great.",0.9545,positive
"  Samsung M21, 6 GB, 128 GB RAM. EXYNOS 10 NM Processor, Samsung 48 MP main back camera. Most importantly Amoled display with AOD. No back cover in case. Good price. The brand is better for people who want to use it for long period. It will stay with you at least for 3 years. Don't fall for the 5G processors, 5G won't be there in India at affordable rates till 2025. It is better deal than Redmi, Vivo, Realme or Oppo. Fingerprint reader is superfast. If you like to watch videos, view pictures or read a book, it is better device than above brands upto price range of Rs.35k.",0.9299,positive
"  Samsung should build some more cell phones like these and variants under 10K as well. This is truly a good cellphone with crisp & clear vivid OLED Display for 14K.SUPER DISPLAY! 5/5Camera performs very well in both daylight and night. You need to be patient and keep in mind you're not holding a 45K plus phone or dslr in your hand for faster shutter speed.Glitches are there ,expecting to be resolved in future updates. The clarity is good even with the selfie camera. Less modes are there , but yeah I use Camera MX so no issues.  4/5Battery life is also upto the mark only disadvantage is the charging time. No fast charging or high watt charger bundled. Not a BiG Problem at all. 4/5Fingerprint is also accurate and works very well. 5/5The UI is typical Samsung UI some bloatware is there , you can uninstall some except the Samsung apps. 4/5Sound is a bit low compared to the MI and REALME , basically ""CHINESE"" devices. However , again not a problem can workout with high volume ringtones for phonecalls. ü§òüèª 3.5/5Body build quality is also good with kind of plastic and metal combination. Colour blue looks premium. Bought tempered glass and back cover together. They arrived early though ü§™. 4/5Headphone jack is also available and the volume rockerz plus power button are on the same side of the phone.Tip- screenshot capture is a bit delay , you need to tap the volume down + power just once and leave , after 2 secs you will be able to see the screenshot capture is processed. There's a visible delay in this. ‚òùÔ∏è Overall for the body options - 4/5Final verdict - In this price range , Samsung is coming back to gain the market and should avail the opportunity (current china ties reservations) to do so by providing more options and more features from 5K till 15K range.Samsung Galaxy M21 - 4.5 / 5.Display is SUPER ! ‚ú®Got it with some discount using Amazon Pay ICICI card and Exchanging Old device. ü§òüèª",0.9801,positive

"  More than after a week of usage, iam extremely disappointed with Samsung M21 phones performance, it is getting hanged, biometric unlocking is not functioning properly... Face recognition is not working since day 1... Apps gets started on their own even with out touching screen at times.... Pathetic phone... Don't go for it... I had purchased the phone on Samsung trust... But it was my mistake.",-0.6701,negative
