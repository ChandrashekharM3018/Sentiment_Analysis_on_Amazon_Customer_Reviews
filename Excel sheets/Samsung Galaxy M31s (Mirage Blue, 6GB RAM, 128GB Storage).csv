"  Honest review for a Honest Samsung phone. I am writing this review after using M31s for more than half month. And my verdict based on truly improved Samsung M series with my experience & tested after usage only.BUILD QUALITY. Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. My hand is small but still I found 6.5 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT.With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M31s feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.BATTERY.Main benefit of this midrange M series is it's maasive 6000mAh battery which gave me enough juice for nearly 3 days continuously. Tested.CAMERA.This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 mwgapixel with Single Take feature. Samsung gives what it advertises. Which made me to stick to Samsung brand. My usage of Camera is high & I found no complaints at all in focusing a shoot. Good color saturated. Well bright night shots. Macro shots r OSM. The depth & clarity of 64 megapixel is more developed in this M31s model. So no complaints.PROCESSOR.After using for more than half month I must say, Exynos 9611 works wonderful liquid speed when it is combined with LPDDR4X RAM technology. I have not faced any lag in PUBG or ASPHALT-9 hight end games, in medium setting which is good for battery saving. So 2.3Ghz speed accomplished. No complaints for the budget spent.SOUND QUALITY.After using for hours I found the Speaker this time Samsung made is much improved with Bass Stereo which was missing earlier. The in-ear delivers your ear the pure Dolby Atmos with clear precision and crystal clear bass effect.Bang for the bucks go for it. Thanks Amazon for Safe delivery.",0.9988,positive
"  Ordered on Prime day, 6th August 12 AM. Received the phone on 8th August.All aspects of the phone is on par or above the next segment.Display is gorgeous.Lookwise it doesn't feel like an M series phone.FP sensor works well although it can store only 3 fingerprints.Camera is overall good. Can't say it's a camera centric phone obviously. However it has some good outputs6000mah battery with 25W fast charging is awesome. (you get reverse charging as well).The only con i felt till now is the exclusion of a phone cover in the box. This might sound silly but I'm one of those guy's who use phone with a cover only to be on the safer side. Just because there is no cover I'm unable to use the phone as my daily driver right now.Come on Samsung. How much will a tpu cover cost for you?? 50Rs??M31s is actually A51 without on screen fp. It has better specs than A51 which retails around 8-9k than M31s which makes this phone one of a kind.The dimensions are also the same as A51. So you can use the same tempered glass but cant use A51 back cover for M31s since it should have the cutout for side mounted fp scanner.Overall a great phone. Value for money I should say. If you are not a heavy gamer this is the best choice around.Will update the review after using the phone for 2 weeks.Till then book your phone and wait for the delivery as it is back-ordered at this moment.",0.9802,positive

  Initial impression after using for one day.1. The display is Gorgeous. Feels like a high end device2. Specs say 6000 MaH battery. Power management is not up to the mark. Without using any power intensive app battery drain is quite pronounced and noticeable.  Hopefully Samsung will release a patch to fix this3.Camera: Impressive.  Good lighting conditions result in beautiful and detailed shots. Struggles a bit during the low light conditions. Overall quite ok for the price.4. Processor: Not the fastest out there  but does the job. Nothing to complain about5. Fingerprint scanner is decent.6. No back case in the box. Will take time to get new case delivered.  Case is necessary as the back panel is quite slippery7. I believe the cost should have around 17K instead of 19.5k...! But if you want a non Chinese phone then this is a good option to consider,0.9325,positive

"  Hi all,From Samsung M31s.Bought it on Amazon Prime day sale. Placed the order by 00:04 of 6th August (Day-1 of the sale) and got it very next day Noon 2pm itself. Kudos Amazon India.Grabbed it for 15,999 with a 2k coupon code and HDFC's 10% discount.But, ordered a Matte Back cover and Matte Temper glass (As it didn't come with the box and also wasn't available near me in Chennai). Delivery date is 18th to 25th Aug which is pathetic. I have to take care my SaM31s like a baby.Small review as per my knowledge -On-hand, its so good. (Earlier was using OnePlus 6) Size wise bit bigger that 1+6 (6.5"")Comparing to Nord, we have Memory card slot - no dependency.While updating the phone on first start, i felt bit heat. But later, it was fine.Charged a 100% and had an extensive usage (not a gamer). Battery lasts more than 36hrs (with Bluetooth earphone at times).Charging happened in 70-75 mins with intermediate usage in between.Earphone Jack available comparing to Nord, better than Bluetooth earphone which consumes charge and needs charge for earphones too.Settings - an ocean of settings, wonderful touch sensor and additional features for lock facilities.But, doesn't have indicator on the front face (which shows if notifications are received)No option to find app usage statistics.Audio - Its so good with clear audio in all needs.Photo - Video : Excellent quality of photos and Videos even in a 3x Zoom. Front camera is bit down.Macro Mode is giving a great pic of Close shots.Has Slowmo, Super slowmo, Hyperlapse, Panaroma.AR zone is pure magical. Different features for Front cam and Back cam.Reverse charging facility is amazing. But the box doesn't have USB - charge cable.Overall - M31s is a price worthy with sooo many options.EDIT : Corning Gorilla Glass 3 is fine,just on 10th day of my purchase, my phone fallen down with less than 1m height (slipped from hand) and display borken 💔Handle with care.",0.9955,positive

"  This is my personal view n review.  I upgraded from ayear old Redmi note 7 pro to M31 s because i wanted a non Chinese phone & m31s promo claimed good camera  battery etc. After usage of a week, I am sure that this was a bad decision. This phone is overhyped n priced. 15k would have been the right price for it. Its camera is good but doesn't give you out of the world experience.  Battery is 6K but doesnt run even for 1.5 day under normal use. Plastic used on backcover is cheap, the Samsung chipset sucks, this phone should have come with snapdragon and in range of 15K. I am not liking to write this review but Samsung has disappointed again. Redmi or one plus phones are clear winners. I will return this phone.",-0.1121,negative
  Upper portion of the phone is getting heated after using it for very short period.....and even when making a call for 2-3 minutes same thing is being experienced.....but lower portion of the phnoe seems fine...also called Amazon technical support to check about this....they checked my phone through servify app...told me all are ok....if anyone facing same thing....please let me know....is it a common issue?,0.296,positive
"  Pros :1. Display -- Amazing Super Amoled2. Battery -- Huge 6000mAh3. Camera -- Great especially the Single Take feature4. Reverse Charging -- Excellent, you can use this phone as a power bank as the cable in box is type c to type c5. Charger -- 25W fast charging6. UI -- Very good and easy to operate7. Fingerprint scanner on side is very Fast8. Gradient look is nice...Cons :1. Chipset still Exynos 9611 (10nm). This could have  been better at this price range....Over all ...Great product....👍4.5 on 5",0.9851,positive

"  I am writing this review after 3 days of moderate to heavy usage.Design: The design of the phone is stunning even though its made of glasstic. The back is a dust and fingerprint magnet. So suggest to use a case. 5/5.Battery: Monstrous. Lasted for a day after watching 2 movies, occasional checking of mails, light gaming and browsing social media. I still had 10% left. The highlight is of course reverse charging and the super fast charging support. Took around 100 to 120 mins to charge the phone completely from 0 to 100. 5/5.Camera: One of the best if not the best camera in this range. The Sony sensor does a great job in the imaging department with some intelli cam features. 4.5/5.Processor and UI: For the last 3 days, that I've been using this phone, UI was pretty smooth and with some bloatware. I am a stock android lover, so thankfully I was able to delete a few pre-installed apps and block the ads/app recommendations while setting up the phone. There are some cool features like smart pop up view which are really awesome. The processor was lag free and its performance was smooth. I don't want to comment on gaming as I am not a heavy gamer. Overall an great choice for day to day usage. 4.5/5.Display: No comments. Just 5/5.The only disappointment I had was there was no case provided in the box. Overall I would give 5/5 for this phone. Regarding the pricing, when I've compared it with the competitors for 6/128 gb variants there was a difference of 1k to 1500 which I felt was fine considering the Samsung brand and features offered.I would recommend this one if anyone is looking for a decent phone under 20k.",0.9895,positive

"  Though not a big samsung fan I purchased Samsung M31S immediately after India launch yesterday for 18K after HDFC discount for 6/128GB after waiting for nearly 2 months for Redmi note 9 pro max 6/128 which was at 17K then went to 18.5K due to tax and production issues coz of lockdown. It was impossible to buy in their weekly flash sales coz Redmi didn’t have enough stock.Out of frustration thought of buying Samsung M31 6/128 which was available at 16K then but the Exynos processor, old dewdrop front cam, rear fingerprint scanner and 15watt charger for 6K battery holded me back…My Lenovo P2 which I had purchased on launch day in Jan 2017 had speaker issues after 3.5 years of usage.. Service centre has closed down in my city and nowhere else speaker was available…but after Redmi stock issues and M31 shortcomings made me purchase speaker for P2 from amazon and still using the phone. Repaired a phone for the first time in my life. Lenovo P2 is most underrated phone. Best battery life ever. Even after 3.5 years I still get 9 to 10 hrs of screen time. Excellent.I have used samsung only once earlier….Note 3 Neo….gud phone intially but later started hanging and pathetic battery life…. So my main expectation after using Lenovo P2s huge 5100mah battery from 3.5 yrs was battery life as I am a heavy user though I never play games.Though M31s processor may not be great for gaming etc it’s gud for normal usage. All my other concerns of M31 were overcome by M31s like punch hole camera, side fingerprint, 25 w charger, attractive design with side frame etc. Also Sony IMX 682 sensor and new camera features were add on.Also in Amazon sale got it for just 500 more than M31 and 500 less than Redmi note 9 pro max during normal sale when I intended to buy 2 monthsago… (6/128 model)I had also considered Poco X2 coz of its camera but was put off by its 4500 mah battery. Many users had issues of battery drain also. But if I had purchased Redmi note 9 pro max, Poco X2 or even Motorola one fusion plus or Realme 6 I would have deeply missed my Lenovo P2s super amoled display…..All these chinese brand phones though have gud Snapdragon processors but have very poor IPS display which r no match to super amoled display. I have seen and compared few IPS display phones with family and friends with my Lenovo P2 super amoled display…..there is day and night difference….So if I had gone with Redmi note 9 pro max I would have missed super amoled display and sony sensor…in samsung m31s I will miss Snapdragon processor…btw my 3.5 yrs old Lenovo P2 is having Snapdragon 625….Its super power efficient and smooth for day today tasks and heavy multi tasking..never played any games though....hope Exynos processor will atleast match S625 if not more.I ordered it on 6th Aug around 12.15 am…. was delivered on 8th Aug…..first impression is very gud especially the camera… excellent super amoled display….even a lot better than my Lenovo P2 super amoled display….built quality is the best in M series with new stylish dual colours and also has a side frame….but can’t b compared to glass backs which r just awesome but very fragile in reality….. anyways how many of us use mobile without case…..so this shall not make any impact for potential buyers of M31S…......case is must for M31s coz back though looks like glass is plastic and will easily get scratches.Battery is also excellent....being a Lenovo P2 user for 3.5 yrs I think finally I got a gud successor for it. Can't really tell the battery screen on time coz I am installing my 100 plus apps and logging in. Today charged from 21% to 100% in 1.36 hrs....so from 0 to 100 it might take 1.55 hrs to max 2 hrs...huge important over M31 which had same battery but would take 2.45 hrs to fully charge.Fingerprint is gud….it's fast but u need to touch it correctly….but I am getting used to side mounted fingerprint…it will take some time as I had front (below the display) fingerprint in my Lenovo P2.Rear camera is excellent. I am still checking out its features. Intelli cam with single take is quite interesting and helpful during important private moments.Indoor selfies r excellent provided there is enough artificial light…. without much light it’s avg like any other mid range phone….if we use front flash (white screen) when lighting is less then photo come very sharp and gud but with little boosted colours like wat normally redmi and realme back cameras do….I am not a gamer…..for normal apps and multi tasking there is no delay at all….hope in long run it remains the same…I am still little doubtful abt Exynos processor after few months….but this processor is tried and tested by samsung in many phones so hoping for the best…",0.9989,positive

"  Liked almost everything about the phone. Except video / movies in dark light where images become pixelated. One more thing is lag in apps such as Smule for instance...Edit 1: after 5 days usage- Without a proper back cover, it is very slippery- Due to the massive battery size, the phone is on the heavier side- Some Apps are not having the proper aspect ratio due to the new dimension of the phone- The screenshot option is very inconvenient as compared to my previous phone, Xiaomi Note 4, that one was so easy to use!- I shifted to this non-Chinese phone (of course when the chance came) & expected it to be better but Chinese phones are surely VFM!- The processor is a huge let down! Seems that the RAM is unable to cope up with the lack of processing speed in this phone- The Camera is good yet using the same will take some more time for a Samsung non-userSome more updates in Edit 2!!!",0.9171,positive
  Very nice phone. I am normal mobile user.. No games.. Just msgs and calls.Used it for couple of days.Below are the points.Pros1. Best display.2. Side finger scanner is fast.3. Good battery life.4. Very good camera for day and Night.5. Feels lightweight and grip is good in hand.CONS1. PLASTIC BODY.2. Quality of Charging cable is ordinary.3. Samsung should have included screen guard and body cover at this price.4. Not sure but internet gets disconnected frequently. Seems some sort of issue.,0.7623,positive
  good product under budget. Got it for 18K in Amazon sale.Phone is not heavy weight though it has big battery.Excellent display with L1 support.Super fast charger.Good camerasSide finger print sensor is very good.Stylish gradient design.Few things I personally didn't like:Build quality - seems very fragile.Too much of pre installed software by Samsung.No back cover included in the box.Phone looks very long (depends on personal choice).I am not a gamer.All in all best budget SUPER AMOLED mobile in this price range.,0.9251,positive
"  Cons:Button position (power& volume) too highThough the battery capacity is high, battery drains fast.A lot of bloatware. Removed loads of stuff, tons still left.Width is less, height is more.The width is less than my MotoG5s+ and hence it disturbs viewing experience e.g. when viewing a YouTube video in a vertical manner.Pros:The fingerprint reader integrated to the power button is nice (touch to open, press down to lock)Does not feel too heavyNice display.The camera is decent.25W charger better than 15W of the M31",0.4215,positive
"  Two issues detected :1. There is a considerable voice fluctuation in the RECEIVER of the device. While talking on call, the voice of person on another end fluctuates (decrease & increase frequently).2. The Single Take camera feature is not working properly. When I capture from Single Take, it only gives 3 videos but not the 7 photos along with that (which, it is not meant for).One could ignore the non working of camera feature once, but RECEIVER related issue can not be overlooked.When any new model is launched in the market, it is recommended to wait atleast 1-1.5 months from buying it, so that the detected bugs would be fixed by the company in the devices manufactured afterwards.I made a mistake, hope it helps others.",0.6705,positive

"  I m not sure to call this a budget phone or a mid range phone. But worth the cost. Got it delivered as promised and seems to have good battery life. It's the 2nd day, I still have got 50% after watching few movies. If you have craze for the features and don't have money to buy a high end phone, then 31s is a better choice. The product is a little bulky than my MiA1. The display is just at it's best. Amoled. Phone doesn't seem to heat. But charging isn't in 97 mins as said. I find it to be around 110-120 mins just like normal phones. But the battery discharge is quite good. Found stock android to be a little flexible comparatively. But not to complaint.

"  Honestly I rarely review on products. I expected a lot from Samsung Galaxy m series particularly from m31s. I purchased one m21 for my father, m31 for sister and m31s for my self on exchange of Oppo f9. I was very happy when I received m31s. But disappointed about the poor packaging. Still I manage my anxiety to taste the set. The handset is having absolute premium looks. Again the picture quality of captured photos disappointed me. Battery is unable to give feelings of 6000mah. Its like less than 4000mah. Network is comparatively weak. Followed the procedure for replacement. The technician asked to install Blancco app to run diagnostic. Then he asked me to go for battery calibration test which is a one day process. Again followed the process of replacement. The technician checked all things and at last told me that the replacement may not be possible for this m31s rather adviced me to go for refund process. The foolish technician rarely knew the process of exchange purchase. On my second attempt of replacement process I came to know that, the first technician registered my complain as the problem is in m21. How foolish. I have compared my m31s with another m31s purchased by my neighbor where I found my set as weaker one. IF REPLACEMENT DONE IN NEAR FUTURE BY AMAZON I WILL BE SATISFIED AND RATE IT AS 5STAR OTHERWISE I WILL WITHDRAW MY PRIME MEMBERSHIP AND CLOSE ALL RELATIONSHIPS WITH AMAZON.",-0.9473,negative

  Firstly I am giving 1star because of its processor I think samsung must upgrade Exynos processor.... And after 2 days use the phone heat too much and battery drained very fastPros..1. Best camera and camera features specially singal take2. Best battery 6000 mah with reverse charging and 25 watt fast charging3. SAmoled Display one of the best display you can say ...Cons...1. Processor It's not so bad but you can say old one..2. I feel some network connectivity issu in my airtel3. Build quality- It is not bad but if the use glass body then it could be much better4. Overpriced 1.5k or 2k5. Heating issue6. Battery draining issue7. It take 3 hours to full charge,0.9179,positive
"  This is just an amazing phone. The camera is really good, Samsung's OneUI is feature rich, but the display and battery are the real MVPs here. For such a huge battery, the phone doesn't feel that heavy, lighter than phones within this price range.But that's because they use glass, and Samsung uses a material which is basically plastic, and to be honest, I would pick plastic over glass anyday. Glass is glass and glass breaks. Besides there is no point in having a glass back if it doesn't have wireless charging as well right?Speaking about the camera, it is very similar to any mid-ranger, but the highlight I would say is Single Take. It is not only just fun to use, but is very helpful as well. I didn't expect to like it this much. It is amazing.Now the display, it's huge. And it's vibrant. It's just a pleasure to look at. Sure it may be 60Hz, but the sAMOLED panel is a cut above the rest.And the 6000mAh battery is coupled with a 25W fast charger, which charged the phone reasonably fast, about 80 minutes from 10% to 98%. This is definitely a two-day phone as I am a mid-weight user, primarily media consumption.The one glaring issue: THE PROCESSOR, and in extension the GPU. It is noticeably inferior to Snapdragon 720g, 730g and the 730 which you can find in phones of similar price range. The difference is not that apparent in daily usage, but I'm sure it will impact a lot if you scroll through media a lot, or if you game a lot. So if you're a gamer, I would suggest a Chinese OEM, they have better hardware for the price.In conclusion, if you are a media consumer who also uses the camera a lot, buy this phone without a doubt. If you are anything more - a gamer, a person who wants to future-proof their phone etc.. I would look elsewhere.I love this phone as this fits my usage perfectly.",0.9936,positive
"  In one word the phone is awesome. U can go for it. I am writing this review after 3 months of usage.Pros:1. Battery life is awesome. It normally last more than a day in vast usage. I had got a maximum backup of 3 day with single charge at normal usage.2. 64 mp camera is just fantastic. Pictures are crisp and detailed. Even it will not haze with sufficient zoom. Night mode is much better then other phones.3. Look is also good with a punch hole camera. Samsung has maintained a premium look even after housing a 6000 mah battery. Phone looks slim.4. Display is much better even then premium Chinese smartphone. Super amoled as it is.5. Finger print sensor is much faster. Face lock is also very good.6. Speakers are loud and crisp. U will get clear, loud and detailed sound while calling and music/ videos playing.7. Gastric look also provide a premium look. (Even Glass back is desired as it becomes a standard now a days).8. Phone weight less with 6000 mah battery. It takes 1.5 hrs to completely charge. Thanks to 25 watts super fast charging from samsung.",0.9884,positive
"  My issue:I purchased this mobile to play PubG or other games but play games on this mobile is now a dream because it's stucking during play and Amazon is not providing any return and replacement option while my return window is still open.Regarding Amazon service:This time amzon changed their policy, so only replacement option available, but you won't be able to replace it because if you are facing any issue then it's technical staff will not approve or accept it.Regarding Samsung:I tried samsun mobile device this time but this company haven't changed so far. They are showing super fast processor or ram but you won't be able to play any game like PubG or any other game, all games are stucking. I will not recommend samsung mobile, you can buy note 9 pro insted of these samsung mobiles.Conclusion before buying any product on Amazon please check they are providing return and replacement option, if they are providing only replacement option then Don't buy those products from Amazon because it's a trap.Don't waste your money on Amazon because they have proven that we should not buy any product online. Because after purchasing if you are facing any issue afterwords their support team will not help you to return it.Thia is just my review and chalanges that I'm facing with AmazonGod bless you guys.",0.9867,positive

And portrait mode is in not in one click, its also not perfect. Macro also not good.2. Battery: The 6000 battery feels like 4500mah battery. One day we can use.3.

There is no second space option, No IR remote and gallery doest have discover,album options like iphone and honor phone.5. No screen recording option and no network speed showing option.Pros:1.

"  Samsung galaxy m31s is most anticipated mobile ever because of its unique mixture of A and M series mobile features. It's the 1st mobile in M series to provide many flagship features like single take, 25w fast charging, infinity O display and even  it is secured by knox.Pros:1.Big battery and it's quite good with 1 and half day use. A light user definately gets 2 complete.days.2. Camera is also pretty good with more flagship features bundled in it.3. Display is an advantage in any samsung mobile. It does pretty well and looking very much premium.4. Loud speaker. Samsung doesn't teased about it but sound quality is really satisfying.5. Knox security is available but may be with limited functions. I haven't seen secured folder or nfc which are still differentiating it with A series mobile.6. Experience is good. I'm not a gamer, so overall i haven't noticed any issues with UI, software or processor.7. Looks are really premium. Metallic finishing gave stunning look to the mobile but note that it comes with plastic body only.Cons:1. Although the charger is of 25W charger, it's taking 2hours to charge completely.. may be because of monster 6000mah battery.2. Side mounted fingerprint scanner. It's a con since i haven't used it before and it's bit difficult to use.3. Phone is slightly heavy but that's because of battery but weight balance is good.Finally, if you are a heavy user but not with heavy games and looking for a clean android experience other than MIUI , colour os etc which will have adware in the apps, this mobile is a perfect purchase for you.",0.9565,positive
  I appreciate the camera quality of M31s.. the selfie camera has a quality as your rear camera and the night shots or shots in dark are much better. The rear camera has a nice focus though not able to take clear long distance shots (100mts) which are very far but shots within 20-30 meters are perfect.I was impressed by the performance and charging as well. I have a 6GB Ram as i'm not a gamer hence could not comment but else good battery life.,0.9446,positive
"  Here's an honest review after a week's usage. Please take the time to read the pros and cons of this device. I'll start with the pros first.Pros:• The Samsung display never disappoints, very good colors.• The device is pretty smooth to use, there's no lag whilst browsing and using multiple apps in the background.• Sound output is decent for this price range.Cons :• The battery life, its supposed to last atleast a day and a half with this 6k mah battery, but i get only 10 hours of battery life with a normal usage such as WhatsApp, YouTube, music and browsing.• Finger print scanner is not upto the mark, since it's narrow and thin button, it doesn't recognise the print sometimes. I have thick fingers and maybe its because of that.• Face unlock is pathetic, I sometimes think that it's scanning someone else's face at times. Most of the time it never recognises my face eventhough I've registered my face in a bright environment. During low light, forget about it.• Notifications bug, when I play a WhatsApp audio or voice note, it constantly notifies me which is annoying. And whilst riding and listening to music, if there's a notification in the BG, after every song it notifies me which is annoying eventhough I turned off notification reminder.• Camera quality is decent but not great like how they've advertised. Some low light shots are grainy and only in bright environments it can capture some good pics.• No screen recording and no notification lights, although this can downloaded from the play store, there's an app for it. But the whole point is this is an android phone and its the basic feature, my previous cheap Chinese Huawei phone had more features.Anyway, overall I wouldn't recommend this if you're just looking for the battery life because it'll disappoint you. I'm quite disappointed with this phone and I doubt if I'd go for Samsung again. Thanks for reading, good day.",-0.9424,negative

"  Another excellent M series mobile from Samsung.  Look of the mobile is elegant. The Amoled screen is very much vibrant and better than the previously launched M30s . Also i felt that the screen size is slightly 2 mm larger than M30s. The front camera is placed slightly 2mm lower than the top edge, henceforth may hinder video viewing in the enlarged screen mode. The battery is a monster with 6000 mAh , so need not worry about charging for atleast 2 days with respect to the way I use. Also thanks to reverse charging facility that samsung introduced in this model. Any gadget that has c-port can be charged directly with the charging cable provided as the both ends of the charging cable are of c- port. I think this feature is only introduced by Samsung in the budget range of less than 20k . However for connecting to the laptop I may have to use the M30s charge cable.  Also there is no heating problem during charging. Also the charging time is approx one and half hour from zero to full charge, which i believe is decent for a battery with capacity of about 6000 mAh.The sound quality is great. The camera quality - primary 64MP and front - 32 MP are awesome. There is a flash available for front cam as well similar to retina flash on iPhone 7 plus. Depth ( similar to portrait mode in iPhone) and Macro modes ( useful for capturing smaller size objects) are decent though not excellent. I am yet to check wide angle mode of camera. Also I am yet to check the night mode shots. Also there are other special features like single click are easy to use . It will capture a bunch of photos and video from which the best and required ones can be chosen and rest can be deleted. There are other features like single video recording on front and back cam , smart selfie option which I am yet to explore and review the quality as I just received the mobile . Also I liked the concept of introduction of finger print on the power  button on the right side. The specification of processor, RAM and storage space are decent for the price paid. Also i believe that samsung is offering the mobiles at the decent spec at lesser price when compared to other premium brands like one plus, MI etc.,. Also thanks to Amazon for delivering the mobile within 5 days, i.e., a week earlier than the promised date as I see that the mobile is not available at the time of order placement, because of the demand. Earlier I bought 2 qty of M30s and I had a very good experience of using them as i never experienced any performance issues with them. Also the M series mobiles are quite sturdy. Now I believe that I will have a much better experience with M31s. Thanks to samsung for the continual launch of better quality mobiles at a very competitive price. Also the samsung galaxy eco system of apps and cloud are pretty decent . Also I have a good experience with the services of samsung incase of any damage to the mobile. Overall I am happy with the product and also with the services of samsung and Amazon.",0.9975,positive

"  My first ever Samsung phone...Feels like a premium phone when you hold it in your hand.Display is awesome. It is very bright even in outdoors.Weight of the phone is little bit more. But it didn't feel heavy, because Samsung has done its weight balance in pretty good manner.Processor is good, didn't feel any lag till now.Fingerprint scanner is a little bit slow. Sometimes it needs to press hard to scan.Camera quality is also good especially in daylight. But typical Super slow motion video(which I like most) is of limited duration.Battery last for 24-30 hrs for normal use (battery optimization could be better). The battery life can be improved by changing power mode in the setting.The 25W charger is also very good. And it is ""Made in India"".Samsung UI is also good.Samsung should have provided at least a case with this 20k phone. It is hard to find case in the market for a newly launched phone.Overall worth for the money. 4.5/5 star.Better than the Chinese phones.Do buy the Samsung phones instead of the cheap Chinese phones.",0.9937,positive

"  So here you'll get my honest opinion about samsung M31s👇I just got this phone.I ordered this phone on first launch day from amazon.Question 1:- What do i think about this phone in this range?Answer:- This phone in this range is quite good but if you're a samsung lover or you boycott chinese product and don't want to buy a chinese phone like mi,realme.You can go for it.Question2:- What do you think about specifications in this range?Answer:- Specification what i like most is Display quality,good battery backup,fast charging,good camera and process is still being tested so keep in touch on telegram @guptajitalks .Question 3 :- Should i purchase this phone in this range?Answer:- Umm i'll suggest you to go for it if you're a samsung lover and your priority is batter backup,fast charging,video watching,camera then please go for it but if in the past you've used realme,or mi phone then don't purchase it because you'll miss some of their feature which is not available in this phone you need to install extra applications for them from play store or other source.Question 4:- Should i purchase Samsung M31 or M31s??Answer:- If your main priority is fast charging and you want to use a new updated fingure print sensor you can go for it otherwise everything is similar in this phone.Choose according to your budget.Question5 :- Does fingure print work fine?Answer:- Fingure print senson is working awesome.I was also getting hesitate but now i am feeling relax because it's working fine and smooth.Question 6 :- Anything else if you want to ask then text me on telegram @guptajitalksAnswer:- Will be updated soon😊I want to mention something:-👇👇👇Note:- 1.Camera,charging,display,cable,Video watching experience is awesome.Processor is still being tested.2.You'll miss some feature if you previously used mi or realme phone.You need to install extra app for it.",0.9895,positive
"  After using 10 days:1. It's not look like 6000mah battery. Other brands phone in below 5000mah, can give more backup than this.2. Very bad wifi receiver. Not able to capture wifi signal properly.

If both sim card are on, in 2nd sim you are getting call, after disconnecting call sometimes network is fluctuating. It's taking some time to stable.4. If you are dropping your phone to bed, some sound is coming. It seems sim tray is casing this noise.5.

"  Lets talk about the positives first:Design & Build - Compelling for this Price range. Fingerprint Magnet - AlertDisplay - Damn, This is the best.Software Experience - This is not a clean UI but I like this feature that Samsung almost took customization to the next level.Camera - Decent, Sony sensors does its job and Samsung's camera features is like a cherry on top.Multimedia Experience - This is what the phone is good at. Believe me it wont disappoint you either.Battery - Humongous. and Fast Charger is in the box. No need to worry about the battery backup.Cons:-Not major but noticeable.Weight :- You ll definitely feel it when used for a long period of time.Performance - This is not so good as the competition provides for this price range. You can notice it heavily while scrolling Twitter.  But everything is usable. Just a little bit of boost to the performance would have taken this phone to the next level.Phone gets little bit warm which is also noticeable. ( I don't know if only I have that issue)Overall - (Gamer boy, Performance Addict) - Just Ignore thisPeople like me those who could sacrifice that little performance for a good multimedia experience should definitely give it a try. And that display, you ll definitely fall in love with it.",0.9819,positive

  Phone which I received is getting warmer around the ear piece area even for short duration calls (less than 2 min) when I made a compliant to Amazon and Samsung they say it's completely normal.My question is how can a earpiece gets warmer even for a short duration calls then how could I take calls comfortably.Better to stay away from this device until we have the complete review or fix for this product.,0.6249,positive

"  Purchased it on sale day, received in 2 days. 5* for Amazon delivery & service. Samsung M31s 8GB 128GB is the best to buy product in around 20k with 6000mah battery & amoled display. Camera is far better than M31 as it used Sony sensor. Works like charm with no lag, beautiful display, good camera, easy too handle, not much of bloatware & many can be disabled/uninstalled of not needed. Overall a good to buy product. 1* less rated due to dual core back cover design, which is not of ok & not much impressive. Otherwise all good. Go for it.",0.9578,positive

"  This is best phone under 20k range and also easily beats many phones under 30k as well.Pros:1. Samsung  brand value2. sAmoled screen, best display, amazin color reproduction, supports Always on Display3. Best in class camera with sony imx 682 sensor, better than many other high range phones as well.4. Single take camera feature works superb5.

Thats great as compared to pill shaped 2 camera or U camera.11. Sapphire camera glass. Checked this in one of the m31s durability test. It does not get scratched even with level 7 scratches.12. Thanks to samsung for not skipping 3.5mm camera jack13. Dolby audio in headphonesand bluetooth speaker14. Loud loudspeakerCons:Nothing as suchOnly better processor would have been cherry on cake.

"  I liked the camera on M31s and I think it's the best camera on a phone under 20k. Apart from that samsung is making Chinese manufacturers sweat by slowly focusing on mid range mobile category so yeah we can expect great phones under low budget as well.  Only thing which I don't liked about this device is Exynos 9611 as it is an old processor & shows its age while gaming. Apart from that everything is ""monster"" 😁.",0.9396,positive

"  Is this the best smartphone under 20,000/-Let's find outBattery:-This is the only reason why I bought this phone. So, I thought I will share my experience regarding the battery life of this phone first.I really use my phone.  I receive over a hundred phone calls per day and hundreds of WhatsApp message if not thousands. When I reach my phone I have an average of 50% juice left in the battery. So to say, I am pretty happy with the battery life on this phone.Camera:-This is another one of the main selling point on this phone.  This phone has quad camera setup at the back and an single punch hole display in the frontList of cameras at the back:-1. Primary camera - 64MP - Sony IMX6822. Ultra wide lens - 12MP - 123° field of view3. Macro lens - 5MP4. Live focus lens - 5MPPrimary camera takes beautiful crisp shots with excellent dynamic range provided ample amount of light. If doesn't disappoint me in night also! The ultra wide camera provides the same amount of color balance and dynamic range. The live focus provides good edge detection. So this is the most improved phone in the 'M' lineup of Samsung phones.Display:-This has a beautiful display with a dot nucth which doesn't interfere much. Therefore this has a good display tooFingerprint sensor:-This phone has a side mounted fingerprint sensor. The placement of the fingerprint sensor is excellent and I quite like it compares with my previous phones which has fingerprint sensor at the back, but one thing which disappoint me is that it won't work when you r hands have even the slightest amount of water or oil or any other thing.Conclusion:-This is not a perfect phone under 20,000/- but it is definitely one of the better phones for 20,000/-.",0.974,positive
"  A perfect phone made by Samsung in mid range. Camera perfect, Body style perfect, Battery perfect  & much more. But a thing I don't understand that why Samsung made charger cable C to C, it would better if it comes with USB to C which helps us to connect it easily with many devices like powe bank,  Desktop and etc.And one more thing I like to suggest to Samsung that, it will be more better if Samsung gives a back cover with every smartphone because in market back covers are available after 3-4 weeks of phone launch & all of us know that it is how risky to use a smartphone without cover.",0.9813,positive

"  The mobile was delivered on Aug 12, much before it was showing earlier. I was using MiMax2, a Chinese product and was happy to use that and had decided to patronise Mi in future. But with current concept of avoiding Chinese products altogether, I ordered Samsung M31s. Initially, it looked to be smaller that Mi max2, though both having 6.5 display. But later on realised that M31s is a bit longer that Mi max2 thus both the phones have the same square cm area!The mobile is fantastic in everything. The finger sensor at the power key on the side is comfortable, so is the face recognition; I am enjoying it. I have set all three, pattern, finger sensor and face recognition for opening it. I could easily install dual WhatsApp. Two sims with external memory card is appreciable, with Volte in both sims always on. Camera should be good; I do not use it much.I could not find a system of locking/unlocking individual app through finger sensor, as I was having in mi max2, nor a shortcut for using torch when in haste. Yet happy for discarding a Chinese mobile and substituting with a good one, Samsung M31s. Go for it.",0.9839,positive
"  Well this is my Jump from Galaxy J7 prime(2016) to this one.  It makes a big difference overall.But don't expect everything to be Premium, honestly speaking1. Camera is not like how it was hyped.

Battery I would like to say it took me exactly 1 hours 44 mins to charge from 0 to 100%. On the other hand it went from 100 to 96% In 23 mins while playing You tube music on Speaker it was connected through Wi-fi, no SIM connection and No any apps in background.5. Processor is fast.

No idea what phone these youtubers  were using but it fits well in my hand and is not heavy!

Very badNo Samsung pay even after paying nearly 20K.Though OneUI is sleek it feels too heavy. Lot of junk ware some of which can be removed but why we need in first place. Why does galaxy store even exists. It started installing some idiotic apps as soon as I opened. Had to remove all the permission to galaxy store to stop it.

"  I was looking for a new phone in the Samsung brand I must say galaxy M31s is the best choice, that too at such a reasonable price.I have been using this phone for over a week now and following are my  views on the phone.1. Delivery by Amazon just the next day of my purchase. Thanks Amazon!2. The size of the phone is quite appropriate,it stays in my pocket easily and can be used single handed. It has a metal like finish3. As far as the display is concerned, crisp and clear with infinity- O display, absolutely soothing to the eyes.4. Sound quality - It has a premium quality Dolby sound and I just love to hear music on this phone.5. The 1st best feature if this phone is it's battery with 6000 mAh. Even if I don't charge my battery lasts for at least 2 days. Also the charger is very fast.6. The 2nd best feature is the camera. It has 4 cameras having best depth and clarity of 64mp with ultra wide lens and macro camera. The clarity of the front camera is outstanding for selfies!I would strongly recommend this phone, you can't get anything better in this range..",0.9931,positive

"  For the first time when I turned the device on out of the box, the device was named as Kamal's Galaxy M31s. Now I dont know who that kamal is!!  Can any one tell me why it is named as Kamals and who that kamal is?  Themes also show as "" Themes recommended for kamal"".  This makes me feel like the device has been used by somebody else before and then remanufactured it and sent it to me.Device manufacturing is of very poor quality (not the mobile phone).  Looking at the box and its packaging, it does not look premium quality.  In fact, the package feels very cheap.  There was no back cover and screen guard provided at all in the box.  This definitely feels like it is manufactured by some local people not by the company like Samsung.  M series being specifically manufactured for India.  This shows how cheap the company sees at the Indians to give this kind of worst packaging and quality.  You can even check the printing on the sticker attached at the back of the mobile with imei numbers.  How cheap quality printing it was. (Check out the images. I even attached photos of my redmi box and u will make out the difference).Mobile phone definitely hangs sometimes.  I faced hanging issue while closing telegram app.  I also faced abrupt closure of apps in the middle on its own while installing all the necessary apps in the mobile.Camera wise, rear camera is good, but front camera is not up to the mark.  In low light conditions there is definitely a lot of noise in the photos taken with front camera.Display wise, it is Excellent being a superamoled display. However, they should have given 90Hz refresh rate for the price of mobile.I am not a gaming person so I dont know about gaming performance in this phone.I had high expectations  on this phone and purchased it with a huge excitement and enthusiasm, but this mobile does not meet the expectations and it disappointed me a little bit.I am somewhat a lover of samsung products especially display related products like mobiles and TV.  But, this time I am little disappointed with cheap manufacturing of the product.  Then again, display quality is very good. Other than that, rest of the things really disappointed me in this phone.",0.9813,positive
  Display is best in this segment. Its bright punchier colorsand great outdoor visibility. Deep blacks is perfect for movies. Sometimes i Miss high refresh rate screens but its ok to have such beautiful Amoled display.Camera is better now. Single take mode is fun to use. Night mode is now better than M31 and the best part is pro mode is back with shutter speed control. 4k front video is useful for bloggers like us. Selfie is good. The only thing i missed is telephoto camera. Syper steady is amazing.The exynos 7611 handles the phone quite well. But samsung should upgrade this to snapdragon or better processor made by samsung. UI is best much better than other phones. Its lag free and smooth. Everyday use is best on thisBattery is best best and best lasts more than 2 days with normal use and one day with heavy use. Screen on time is around 9 hours. And the best part is it has the same charger with Samsung provide with s20 series. So i can use my s20ultra with the same charger.Overall i can say its best in this segment if you dont need high refresh rate display but you want best battery life and beautiful vibrant display with better color accuracy then go for it,0.9991,positive
"  Overall this is a phone for non gamers, camera lovers and for media consumption. It has been a mixed reaction with 15 days usage. More details below. Thank you for reading.Pros;Display: 10/10 nothing more to say.Camera:Back cameras are really good with all four of them being useful in different conditions. Apart from the 64MP primary sony sensor the 12MP wide angle and 5MP macro sensor give good quality pics and not there as a gimmick.Front camera is a mixed bag. Under slightly low lighting conditions it doesnt produce great pics and is bit grainy. Samsung please fix this with an update. But if you put the screen flash details are good.Colors are saturated which some will like and others may hate.Network Reception and data:So far so good. However, it is not the fastest w.r.t data download speeds under this price category. It depends on the modem that has been used.Battery: At first the 6000mah battery seemed like a 4000mah w.r.t performance showing battery drain issues. You need to check the device health statistics to determine the culprits. If you have turned on adaptive brightness (auto brightness) then battery consumption will be high. Since smasung uses the front camera for auto brightness. I would suggest you to turn it off. Secondly add apps which you don't use frequently to sleep and deep sleep under battery optimization. Also switch on the adaptive battery optimization. After all this now it finally lasts longer in the range of 40 - 44 hours in a single charge. Again it can vary based on your usage. But these steps will definitely increase your battery life per charge.Cons:Processor: Samsung please use a nice processor in such a good mid range smartphone. This is a downer. Almost everything else is good. Gamers please stay away from this phone. Day to day task are fluid but still you may notice occasional lags while opening some apps and animationsGlasstic Back: If you use a cover on your phone this may not be a concern. However, people who like the phone as is...may not be able to use it without worrying about a scratch.Weight of phone: Along with a good cover this phone can build your biceps. You can feel the weight.Overall people who use a phone for connecting, productivity, social media, vlogging and media consumption then this is a good one. Gamers will hate this for sure.",0.9966,positive
"  I ordered the phone as soon as it went on sale, i.e on the midnight of August 6. I was unaware that it would only be available to prime users so I had to first subscribe to Amazon prime, and during this process the blue variant of the phone that I wanted to buy went out of stock. Nonetheless, I managed to order the mirage black 6gb variant which was the only one available at around 12:25 am.But yeah I would say that I'm not at all unsatisfied with the black one as it looks so stunning. The phone was delivered to me on the morning of August 9, that is pretty fast.It has been 2 days since I'm using the phone and I would say that there is a lot about the phone to boast. I'm so happy to have been able to buy this.Everything about this phone is so awesome but the two outstanding features of this phone are its premium looks and the rear camera. The rear camera captures stunning images in all light conditions and the quality of videos is also amazing. I really loved the single shot feature, its fun to use. One thing that I'm a little bit disappointed with is the performance of the front camera in low light. The sAmoled display is so cool, you won't face any problem operating your phone in the sunlight.The 25W charger is quite useful as it charges the phone at a blazing speed. The 6000 mAh battery lasts longs but I haven't tried extreme gaming yet.So guys just go for it! Nothing can be better than the Samsung Galaxy M31s at this price range.",0.9899,positive
"  The processor is pathetic, your phone would start lagging as soon as you start to use it. I had hoped that samsung one UI won't have many bugs but it has crucial bugs linked with speaker and mic that won't resolve after updates. Sound quality is okay for movies and stuff but pathetic for music. On top of that, Amazon won't accept returns and replacement is too much hassle. I'm used to buying literally everything online but that stops now. The only good thing with this phone are nice display and fingerprint and an average camera with bad camera app. If you can shell out a little more go for little higher end phones with better processor and never buy an Exynos",-0.4857,negative
"  Good Phone for the price being a Samsung phonePros -A fantastic display, extremely colour acurate, vibrant, with great sunlight visibilityGood build quality, thought its plastc but looks gorgeousOne of the best camera performer around this price range here I am very specific because I am a photographer by professionInspite being a 6000 mah battery does not feel that hafty & well balenced to holdHeadphone sound output is best in class also the speakers, Media consumption on this phone is a fantastic experience.One UI is better then ever on a Samsung phone now, extremely stable & smooth nowCons -The processor is not that powerful at all, despite being the 8gb varient that I bought shows lag & stutter around the UI every now & then on heavy multitasking usage, high end gaming is also not a smooth experienceThe 6000mah battery sounds much but it doesn't last more then 1 day battery drains so quickly on this phone ( hopefully will be fixed by futer updates )The wifi hotspot only supports 5ghz band its not a duel band one on this phone so if u have a laptop or PC with 2.4 ghz wifi adapter, you won't be able to access the hotspot from this phone, I had to purchase a 5ghz wifi adaptor for my PCOne UI core version on this phone lacks so many features that we found on A series phone so thats a compromise on this phone specially I miss the lack of led notification on this phoneThe Camera to API on this phone does not support Google CameraOn the Camera department , it does not support 50/60 fps1080p, its only limited to 30fps thats a downside for me specificallyPhone does not support some graphic intense apps like .. Adobe Premiere rush, & few moreGorrila glass 3 is not that grat in terms of display protection, so installing a screen guard is a must, also the back is very proan to scratchesThe figer print sensor is good but not that fast like Xiaomi phones, also the face unlock misses so many times but thats also subjected to be fixed by updates.Overall its a good ""Samsung Phone"" if you dont run much graphic intence games or apps",0.979,positive
"  Poor configuration mobile from Samsung ( Review after a month of use )Following are the reasons:1) They processor performs poorly causing the phone to hang all the time2) The screen touch sensitivity is poor and screen blanks out while making a  call. Need to double tap it every time to get the screen alive ( eg for a IVR call )3) Battery performance sub par.4) Too bulky and fat to use.5) Very poor sensitivity fingerprinter reader. For a left handed person makes  its use complicated due to positioning of the sensor.6) Camera is great quality but for Rs19,500 ie cost of phone I would rather buy a  DSLR camera to enjoy even better quality pics than get stuck with a phone  whose only ability is to click good photos. Remember a smartphones first and  primary use is to make phone calls and its smart use. Both which are sub par.My verdict ..... Please dont go purely on the star rating and reviews published on Amazon.Do your own research and decide.",0.9633,positive

Also sound quality is awesome, & with headphones amazing experience as it provides Dolby Atmos feature while using headphones gets activated & you can enjoy the theatre like experience.

The touch response is butter smooth. I think it is at par with an iPhone.3. No lag, no heating issues, no screen problems so far.4. Battery life is very good.Cons:1. There is a huge amount of bloatware. I uninstalled most of them, but some cannot be uninstalled. I disabled or forced stopped them. I deleted 1 star because of bloatware.2. The side mounted finger print sensor is not very convenient. They should have given a normal real mounted FP, which is easier to use. I deducted another star because of side mounted FP.3. The face recognition feature does not work all the time, but that is a common issue across many other phones.",0.5091,positive

Which is still not availble in market as well.When you got the box... i observed box quality is quite low as comoare to other brands however no problem..this is ignorable..every companies looking for cost cutting.Phone is good if you are normal user watching media and social networking sites and small gamers.Gamers definitely need to go with realme, mi, other brands having high antunu scores",0.8405,positive

"  Bought the device on the first day of its release. Have been using the same for more than a week now and below is the review of its real life performance:Pros:1. It has an amazing display. Samsung is an undeniable champion of amoled displays and this phone is not different in terms of its standards.2. The camera, both front and back, are an amazing tool to play with. The photos come out real sharp and detailed. The single take feature is very handy feature and will be a boon for any beginner who will be able to capture amazing moments with a single click.3. The performance is very snappy for daily use. It is not made for heavy gaming, however it will not disappoint for light gaming.4. The UI experience with the One UI is amazing and smooth.Cons:1. The placement of the fingerprint sensor on the power button and that can be tricky for some of the users to get used to with. 2. It is not supplied with cover and that is strange considering all the smartphones in the segment are supplied with one.Hope the review was helpful.Willl update the review if something noteworthy discovered while using the device.",0.9696,positive

"  Reviewing this after 48 hours of arrival..So far So good..Haven't experienced any lags..This Samsung One UI is so easy to use than redmi UI (IMO).Build Quality:It is glasstic material in back and our hands are Imprinted ..So better to buy a Back case as soon as possible..On the sides I think its made of metal ..Could have gone with a different material but front looks stunning with a broad screen and a bit curved (4/5)Camera:Gives its best in high lightning areas and indoor shots are good too ....Night Mode is absolutely beauty and the single take feature is woww (4.5/5)Battery:First of all charged it for 7 hours and it took approximately 1.15 hour to charge from 30 to 100%.After a moderate usage for about 36 hours it has a charge of 50%. (4.5/5).Sensor:The side ways fingerprint is new and it is quick enough..Face Unlock is quite a bit slow..(4/5).Overall:Since I am not a gamer i prefer this phone is worth buying and tried adobe Lr Mobile..It is easier to use and in the range of 20,000 with a good UI with a moderate processor ..This is preferred.. It also comes with Knox Security",0.988,positive
"  CONS1. Battery life not worth the hype. Drains very quickly. Paying 20k for 6000 mah battery and watching the battery percentage go down in front of your eyes so quickly feels very bad. Am normal user, use only and only WhatsApp for office work and calling yet battery drains faster than my 3 year-old Lenovo K8 Plus.2. Unboxing experience not good either. Very disappointing that back cover was not included in box.3. Dated processor shows its mark occasionally for example when searching for something in the native Settings app or launcher.4. Camera performance in absence of abundant light is deplorableNOTE: Am facing weird call drop issue in WhatsApp calls but not sure if it's phone's faultPROS1. Fingerprint and face unlock are both very fast2. Single Take feature is amazing3. Screen, form factor, design looks and feels greatTL;DROverall, if you don't expect TOO much from the battery, you're gonna love this phone. Best non-Chinese phone under 20k atm",0.6786,positive
  Awesome phone better than realme and mi phones,0.7906,positive
  1. Fingerprint reader is very fast.2. Face unlock is a little slow though it can capture your face in a mid range dark room too.Disadvantage of the face unlock was once it cannot recognise your face it does not try again you'll have to use the fingerprint or password.3. Camera quality is amazing in the light but in the dark there's a little disturbance.4. The battery life is not that good as expected though they have advertised a lot about the battery being 6000mah. It's charges pretty fast.5. Reverse charging also works amazing though you cannot charge it to any phone which uses a B cable. Only C to C phones will work for this.6. A phone cover should have been provided with the amount taken. Plus its a little slippery so a phone cover is a must.Overall it's a good phone but these are a few pros and cons when buying the phone.,0.8999,positive
"  If u r not interested in heavy gaming then can't get a better deal for a phone under 20k.Pros-1) Screen - there is no doubt Samsung does provide the best screen. U will notice that instantly,  and Super Amoled is really something if u r coming from ips led screen.2) Battery - Seriously what they advertise is real it really is a monster. Last from1.5 - 2 days depending on ur usage.3) Camera - This is the first time Samsung is using Sony sensor in there below 20k phone and boy can u tell the difference.  Sony sensor with Samsung image processing is just lit, hands down can't get better camera in this budget.4) Software- Being a past redmi and realme user i can tell how much software is important and oneui is very smooth with no blotwares or ads and works really well. I guess after oxygen os and stock Android,  one ui is right behind them.5) Design - This phone looks far better then it looks in images and overall weight balance is great , doesn't feel heavy at all even though having such a massive battery.Cons-1) No Knox security- Don't be confused by all the reviews u find online, there is no knox security included, idk why it shows secured by knox in boot menu but still there is no such thing. It is such a great and convenient thing I just wished they included it here atleast considering the price budget.2) Processor- It has the same exynos 9611 processor thats in their phone that cost around 11-12k . Come on Samsung why are u stuck on the same processor upgrade it there are several better option available.2) Build- It is a plastic body and is very slippery, so requires a cover ,which is not included in box.3) Screen around the front camera gets automatically and returns back to normal after sometimes, since it is a software bug I hope they fix it future updates , sometimes it stuck out and gets a little annoying.",0.8562,positive
"  So, it has been few days since I got my hands on Samsung Galaxy M31s, and I've got to say if you like media consumption on phone this is the best. Let me divide this into pros and cons.A. Pros  1. AWESOME DISPLAYI mean it when I say this has got an awesome display. The infinity-O sAmolled display is perfect for media consumption. Sure it has not got that high refresh rate that some Chinese phone makers and high end phones are providing, but the qualtiy of the display, is top notch. (Also like some infinity o displays out there this doesn't have any beading or halo effect around the camera cutout) 2. SINGLE TAKE IS SUPERBYou have to use this feature to get to know how good it is to have it on a phone. There are time when we want to capture a moment both in videos and photos (maybe with some filters) This feature let's you have that. It automatically captures the best photos and videos with just one shot. It's not as good as that in Samsung's flagship phones (just because they can capture using various lens and m31s uses its primary 64MP lens) 3. MONSTER BATTERY LIFEWell that's to be expected right? 6000mah should last you a full day with heavy load (like heavy gaming and media consumption) I had 15-20% remaining battery with heavy use. But mostly with semi-heavy gaming and usage the phone lasted me almost 2 days without charge. 4. WELL OPTIMISED PHONEM31s has android 10 with One UI 2.0 out of the box and it's a well optimised for apps and games. I have not faced any stutter or lag while using apps or playing games like pubg and codm. 5. 25W Super fast chargeSamsung provides with the flagship typec-type c Samsung 25W super charger inside the box. Thus it takes relatively less time to charge the huge 6000 mah battery. 6. Non-Chinese phoneSince boycott Chinese products is going on and most of the smartphone are made in China, this is a phone which is made in India so a good alternative.B. Cons 1. Plastic buildSince it's a plastic back it easily picks up scratches. So I recommend to use a case or a skin on this phone. (Case does not come with phone so you will have to purchase it)Well I don't have any more cons that I can think of. Yes it would have been good if Samsung upgraded the processor, but one UI 2 is well optimised for this particular processor so maybe that's why they didn't upgrade the processor.Basically M31s has a good screen, battery life, awesome camera, good fingerprint reader and is a excellent Samsung phone.",0.9985,positive
  Big thumbs up for this mobile. Looks great. Only draw back is battery not performing like 6000 mah. Hardly one full day with full battery. Everything else is perfect 5 star.Finger print sensor is lightening quick.UI experience is niceCamera is top notchI feel UI needs few more customizations within ONE UI itself. Case and screen guard should have included in the box. Battery size 6000 mah is eaten up by Exynos processor makes this phone battery offset. No advantage of having 6000 mah battery.I think this is going to be the last phone with these many features in sub 20k range. M51 is going to be sub 30k range for sure.Got this phone with exchange and it's a good deal,0.8641,positive
"  though price great higher than m31 and most specs are similar to the its predecessor, I will prefer M31s to buy as it may sound more future proof. First the things i don't like and i know i am writing cons part first as besides it con part it is actually best phone with everything top notch in its real time usage.* Its processor, in day to day usage didn't find major lags or hang thanks to the great software optimisation with one UI through heavy usage and fast multi tasking might get difficult and i also notice it take more than usual time to power on.* i don't consider it as a con but it is heavy though weight balance is so good that you don't feel it is 200g+ phone* and last one , its about buying a 20k phone ans still not getting a phone case, screen protection and earphones is disappointing to be honest. for initial protection you need these things.* overall couldn't find more negative. i mean there are few small thing but i consider it as personal preference so no complain.some pros-* Its design and its build quality is top notch in the price range of 20k thanks to the added frame and back design.* Its camera department , display is the best* fingerprint scanner is fast though it is parallel to the frame you may need time to use to it.* it is waste actually waste of time to write positives and everything asides cons are great .to be honest i am completly satisfy with this phoneand last thing i prefer 6gb and 128gb varient as it is more value for money . OVERALL A BIG THUMPS UP.",0.9922,positive
"  Its been a month. The M31s is working perfectly. Totally in love with it.The best Non-Chinese smartphone you can get in the market right now.I was fed up of Xiaomi phones.Pros:Looks daam premium.Display is the best one you ever see.Sound quality is also top notch.No ads in the UI.6000mah Battery works for 2 days.Camera quality improved than M31 and new features added.Cons:Only thing is, as the back panel has plastic glass, it gets finger prints attracted very fast. You will need to buy a back case to avoid this.",0.9738,positive
"  The best phone Samsung has ever made in this price segment.1.Display makes this phone to compete with the high end flagships.2.Sony sensor is really an add back to this phone since it takes excellent pictures in daylight especially.3.Most reviewers had commented on the processor part that it is not a gaming one but my experience with this phone was different, tried PubG with ultra setting which worked very smooth and lag free.4. Battery perfomance is other thing which stands out and it last me 1.5 days with single charge.5. Fingerprint and Face unlock are insanely fast.The only drawback was samsung could have added a back cover and Screenguard with the box but what I did was ordered the cover along with the mobile.Overall I will rate 4.5/5 for this phone because this really adds a premium feel and experience.Hope this helps!",0.6953,positive
"  Look wise an excellent product,looks better than m30s and m31, infinity o design looks premium and doesn't feel heavy.Rear camera is actually 16mp main shooter, give you 64 MP image by pixel binning technology excellent one,ultra wide is average, macro excellent.Front camera is actually 8mp gives you 32mp image, average in quality.Display is sAmoled excellent, very well visible in day light.Processor exynos 9611 good for routine tasks not great for gaming.Multitasking and ram management is good.Battery backup is excellent. Inspire of fast charger it takes enough time to charge to 100% due to its large size 6000mAh.Side mounted fingerprint sensor is good.Some software related issues are there which can be solved via an OTA update.Operating system Samsung one UI2.0 is good but missing many features like screen recording etc.Overall a very good deal during this independence Day sale.Of course I get a good exchange value for my one old mobile.If you are not a gamer definitely it's worth to buy.Major problem is its wireless Bluetooth connectivity, auto connect and disconnect frequently, Samsung fix this.",0.9731,positive

"  List of things that I noticed after using for 7days-1. Battery :- As per the mentioned specs the phone got a  massive 6000mah battery 🔋 but as per my usage it lasts hardly for a day ( I didn't try any game and mostly used  for stuff like taking online class ,watching YouTube videos and listening music) but the charger compensates it. It took 2 to 2: 20 hrs to fully charge( depends on condition )2. Camera:-The thing that disappointed me the most is the camera quality of the phone especially the front camera. The front camera is 32mp but the quality of camera is not as good as the no says . It cannot compete with with Chinese co. like Oppo and Vivo in terms of camera. During night even at decent lighting condition the photo it clicks appears to be blurry.White balancing of the photos is not accurate.Live focus is unable to clearly detect the edges of the photos.I previously had Vivo v15 having 32mp 1.5 yrs older whose camera quality is far better from this device which arrived later than that.3. Dark mode is awesome that at night we even cannot distinct the edges of phone and the screen.I loved it4.Design:- Design of this device is 👍 👌5. Sound quality is decent6 Processor: Samsung should have provided better chipset than this.7.While I was taking class on Unacademy within 20mins it got heat up.8.Screen:- Screen is awesome,the s-amoled screen produces awesome colors and the viewing experience is great on this deviceHope samsung fixes the list of problems  I mentioned especially the camera capture during night through the next update",0.9876,positive
"  Camera : too good. Pics cameout fantastic on all cameras(haven't checked night time performance but low light performance indoors was good) without any over-saturation or discontinuity/fading issue like similar priced oppo /vivo mobiles.Battery: slightly better than m30 and there's 25w fast charging. Almost 5 hrs of SOT on medium brightness n mixed use of media, browsing/shopping wifi.Screen: Its samsung. I don't need to say anymore.No lag of any kind seen since. The only cons i felt r the phone is on heavier side, exynos processor( u'll consider only if u Need to play pubg like graphic intense games on topmost settings)  and may be the fingerprintScanner position, fr some. I got used to it in a day but took my mom 3 days now she's ok with it.",0.979,positive
"  It's an absolutely fluid machine. Awesome sensors at the right place. Just wondering if Samsung would make profit by selling this phone at this price. I am sure they are limited quantity and would be taken off soon. The fingerprint sensor is very sensitive and responds with diligence. The great feature is its power-packed camera which not only has extremely powerful lenses, but blended with lossless software to encode it. Battery survives for 2 days, with extensive use for calling and listening to music. I am a lisztomaniac, so you may imagine. Thanks. Very contended.",0.9058,positive

Almost every function is available on notification tray.5. Super Amloed Screen gives you a glance experience.6. Customize your phone according to you.",0.9248,positive
"  I'm updating my review after 20 days of use. Super display i love it. Great UI. Very good interface (smart switch app) from Samsung to transfer data from old to new phone, effortless. Camera is good, i hope it will improve with updates.I hate bloatware. I purchased 8Gb RAM version, but out of 8 gb, only half is available, it is irritating some times. I observed a bit of lag while playing mine craft. So, I must say that processor can be improved.Overall, good phone, considering non-chinese brand.",0.8787,positive
"  Overall good  experience, my rating would be 3.5.Pros:1. Size : Good for movie & gaming.2. Camera : Very good, works exceptionally good in night mode.3. Look and feel : Vivid, typical samsung type.4. Pre- installed softwares: Limited and only required ones. good from security aspect.5. Weight : Feels heavy and when in pocket will definitely make u a feel that u are carrying something worth not losing.Cons:1. Phone heats up if used continuously for 30 mins for phone calls.2. Even video calls and you tube playbacks heats the phone near camera area. Pretty unexpected from an highend phone from Samsung3. Battery: Not a good performance as per 6000 mah. LAsts for a day with normal usage, i.e. phone calls, whatsapp, 1 hour youtube video, and some browsing. To be honest, i am disappointed on battery performance looking at its size especially when Samsung made it a big USP.4. Crux: You have better options in this price range, would recommend to try those instead of blowing 21,500 on this phone.5. Processor: Samsung has not done any big changes in its old Exynios Genre.Must go ahead..But Samsung has been a miser..did not provide  rear silicon cover.Charging cable length is just OK IN length.",0.9809,positive
"  This is amazing value for money mobile, earlier i was using asus but changing mobile worth it.Battery: no worries charge within 1:40 hr, whuch is great compare to other mobiles.Camera:awsome, it captures what you needed.Screen :it's samsung USP it could never go wrong.Processor 9611: i also have some concerns before buying but it's not bad. many review available in internet saying processor is not good, but believe me i play lots of game (Pubg, COD, Asphalt, Mortal combat etc most game size 2.5 gb) , do not find any problem, only difference isduring first time game loading takes few seconds extra as compared to new processors.  So while playing no issue.Screen refresh rate: it's a myth 90 hrtz is better compared to 60, hidden fact is your eyes are only detecting 30 frames/hrtz, so your eyes are not even usung 60 hrtz frequency.Weight: yes it's slightly heavy bit do not hurt while typing or gaming, weight is well balanced.Protection: No comments, I always cover my mobile with screen gauard and back cover,  looks and sturdyness are also fine for me. But for this point you could count on other internet reviews, as i am playing safe with my mobile.",0.9871,positive
"  I have recieved this mobile on 13th Aug, delivery well in advance. Mobile looks and features all looks superb. Suddenly on 21st august the mobile started giving advanced touch error and then screen gone off. Now the mobile display is off. Return window is closed on 20th Aug. Service centres are working only on limited days. I had to purchase a mobile immediately for my daily job. Samsung customer care also giving false information related to service centre. I go to office and find time only on saturday and sunday. Service centre is open only on monday, wed and friday that too with limited manpower. I purchased samsung mobile for the first time and now feeling bad about my decision. A latest mobile with limited application downloaded has suddenly crashed. Waste of my money.",0.4588,positive

  Received the phone today.  Inserted SIM.  Started phone.  Wi-Fi  problem couldn’t authenticate connection.  Reset whole Router with new SSID and Key.  Reconnected all other devices with new SSID and key including my old Redmi Phone.  All devices got connected except this brand new Samsung.Called Amazon Customer care.  They advised for a hard factory reset.  Did factory reset twice.  Still the same problem.  First impression is the last impression – May be Samsung hasn’t heard of it.  As of now they have allotted a technician to look into it.,0.2263,positive
"  After using it for a week,in this price range definitely a good gadget.Touch,camera,processor speed,finger print sensor up to the mark.A lot has been said for the battery,it charges fast only if you off the net,location,keep phone on power saver than it charges in 90mins otherwise it takes 130 mins to charge,battery drains too quickly than M31.All other aspects are good,one can buy if don't want to go for Chinese one.",0.291,positive
"  To begin with the phone is a complete package. Display gives an amazing experience, no doubt it's a battery monster coupled with 25 watt fast charging, reverse charging offers a great advantage, rear cameras give the best shots in the price segment, they add great variety also, front camera is good, the auto wide angle selfie feature is really handy, but sharpness can be improved. Single take is fun to use. Side mounted fingerprint sensor is really quick. It has Knox security but it's limited as it doesn't have secure folders and other A series features. Though made of plastic it still has a premium look and feel unlike the previous M series phones. Single mono bottom firing speaker is adequately loud but sounds a bit tinny at times. Dolby Atmos is present only for headsets and the music output is excellent. Processor is not made for gaming, hardcore gamers stay away. It's smooth and breezy for day today tasks. Multi tasking is no issue. OneUI 2.1 has excellent improvements over the previous versions. Call quality, network reception is absolutely fine. Internet download and upload speeds are quite satisfactory. Overall it's a great experience. Loved it",0.9927,positive
"  Samsung has been giving the best amoled displays for quite some time now. This phone keeps up with the tradition. There is No 90 or 120 Hz refresh rate so yes that can be an argument as competition offers that.But then Samsung display is Samsung display. You just can't get wrong with it when it comes to watching videos.M Series is known for its battery, and the M31s delivers a punch here. Also, despite a beefy battery, phones ergonomics are pretty well handled and overall grip is comfortable (but sligthly heavy) thanks to back end curves.Phone looks and feels beautiful and the polycarbonate material build quality feels good but I don't intend to test it. Back is a finger print magnet.The Exynos 9611 SOC is good enough for less power hungry games but there is frame lag in certain games which demand graphics. Overall with 6000 mAh battery, a better optimization by 9611 SOC might have led to more than 2 day life, but no one is complaining.Call quality and reception is pretty good.Okay, the best part is Camera! Somehow Samsung has managed to fit a very very decent camera in to this one. Yes colors can be over saturated (5/10 times) but it's the same with most phones these days as perhaps the general public likes punchy colors.Video recording is pretty fine tooBut the winner here is the Night mode. Don't know what got into Samsung's head and they have accidently incorporated a very improved night mode for a M-series phone (less noise and better field of exposure). Its easily the best night mode in under 20,000/- category of phones.Even the 12 MP ultra-wide takes better pictures than other ultra-wides in daylight.Overall a good solid phone. Samsung is always guilty of over pricing (may be their screen costs more or whatever), but still would attract many. A price of 18000/- may just have killed the competition, but may be not this time.Disclaimer:I'm a very casual gamer, mostly see movies on Netflix and Amazon Prime video and so display and battery are my priority and the M31s doesn't disappoint here.Clear advantage is the camera, specially it's Night Mode.The 9611 SoC handles my daily routine well and 6GB RAM eases multi-tasking problems for the SoC. So didn't notice any lag in my experience so far.Min storage is 128 GB, and I really never needed more. You can always use a micro SD card to futher add storage.The review is based on my usage and i feel most of the crowd uses phone for social networking, web browsing and occassional gaming, so any basic SoC can handle it fine.",0.9981,positive
  Samsung m31s this is a super phone which never I have seen my life extraordinary battery life and extraordinary camera features and superb fingerprint reader fast and accurate than other phones in this phone Face Unlock is also so fast .In the box they didn't provide any case for the phone and no earphones for the phone but in a series they will provide a case and earphones and in the M series wild didn't provide case and earphones I don't know this is I was disappointed in Samsung M series so but the phone is superb and naturally grade in camera quality so perfect and I appreciate the Samsung offices to make a Sony sensor of 64 megapixel super phone in the 2020 year thank you for Samsung officers taking this phone to market,0.9791,positive
"  Another well desinged model from Samsung M seriece with high capacity battery. Android 10 + Dark Mode best combination for Samsung display to viewPros-Design & Display The design of the mobile is awesome with 6.5 Inch Super Amoled Full HD display. Big screen to watch movies. The pixels resolution and smoothness of the screen is damn good. Nobody can beat Samsung in terms of dispaly. Glassy finishing at back side is too good. Edges and screen ratio is fine. Classy look. UI is awesome- Storage 6GB/8GB RAM is definitely huge, helpful for gamers, mutli purpose users. I didnt see any lagging or hanging till now while using. 128GB storage is lot to store-Battery Battery life is good. Lasting 24hours after more use, still 30% or 35% power will be remained.-Charger The charger cable is coming with Type C at both sides. Very fast charging 25W.  Reverse charge is provided in this model which is good option to lend some charging to others (Can use M31S as a powerbank :P)-Camera Came with new feature Single Take which helps you to capture realtime photos and video at the same time (Slow motion video, Fast Forward video, edited photos). Camera clearity is good and decent, Macro, Live Focus options will bring the creative photographer in you, but when I compared with Mi Cam I feel Mi cam sharpness is better-Processor Coming with Exynos 9611 processor. Works really fast and good without lagging.Cons- Since the size is big little bit difficulut to operate with single hand, but now a days it's not a big issue- Fingerprint scanner is not very accuarate, sometimes you may feel disgusting to unlock, even face lock also slow in response sometimes. Can be improved- Sound Quality is good but volume is not much- No indicator for notifications- Unncessary preinstalled Samsung apps- Ads on the screenPrice could have been set 18k as there is no much difference between M31 and M31S in terms of battery, processor, camera (Except Single Take). Must buy for Samsung Lovers",0.9909,positive
"  SAMSUNG GALAXY M31S is really a very good phone with very advanced features it have all the features what the company claims .

CAMERA - 10/10 The camera is superb64 + 12 + 5 + 5 MP Quad Primary CamerasLED Flash32 MP Front Camera, No Front FlashThe camera is up to the mark it will make photos so beautiful 😍2. BATTERY - 9/10 The company says it has mega battery of 6000mAh with super fast charger . I would say the charger is really fast . It takes almost one and a half hour to fully charge it and then the battery last for maximum 2 days3.

"  Using it since last 3 days and nothing significant  o complain other than fingerprint sensor. I guess this is little pricey compared to China phones  especially  comparing to MI Redmi note series which are are almost 40% cheaper and slightly better. Nevertheless I purchased Samsung believing they have stringent quality  checks compared to Chinese.Cons:1) Fingerprint sensor located on the side is annoying since it is tricky to unlock when used with a TPU back case. I would have appreciated if the sensor was on rear instead which would have been very convenient  compared to side to use. Don't use any case if you want the fingerprint  sensor to be less annoying  or choose the ones having sensor only in the rear or indisplay..2) setting  up this phone Initially is very annoying  and consumes lit of time. God knows what updates it is updating in the background which seem i could not find3) Little pricey compared to MI redmi note series phones,  I was using redmi note7s  prior to this phone. The hardware is more or less comparable to MI redmi series phones which are available at much cheaper prices...I purchased Samsung and just avoided the temptation of Chinese  phones in respect to boycott..otherwise they are pocket friendly. Hope samsung reads this review and refund me and bring down the prices a little bit as wellPros:1) Samsung brand, assume completely made in india...not sure how many chinee components  are used though2) display and battery3) decent camera4) does not over heat during normal use",0.8491,positive

"  So after using the M31s for more than 3 weeks, I have a mixed feeling about the device.Things I love about the phone:1. Display2. Clean UI3. Looks good compared to other M seriesThinks which are just Ok:1. The camera is identical to the older M31 and thus is underperforming.2. The battery isn't that monstrous as they claim. Felt like 4000 mAh. But still takes 3 hours and 40 minutes to get fully charged.3. External speakers are better than other M series but aren't good as most mid-rangers.4. Dolby Atmos audio failed to meet expectations as it is only good for enhancing the treble (Great help if you are old).Thinks I hate:1. Bulky and heavy. Feels like some walkie-talkies that I used to have during my childhood!2. Poor performance for this price! Can't even play games like Asphalt 9 without lags and frame drops.3. No option for random wallpapers with the One UI 2.4. Face unlock is pretty slow and thus is an obsolete feature!5. A slippery and plasticky body which acts as dirt and fingerprint magnet. Back of the phone is now full of scratch.6. The phone rebooted by itself 15 times in 22 days which is something scary for me!7. Unable to feel that Samsung signature, I can't explain why but feels like those Chinese brands on hand.",0.9649,positive

"  This is my 3rd Samsung Mobile. I was a big fan of Xaomi Redmi Mobiles, had 4 of them; I still am a fan, except for some performance issues, quality and other worrying issues with security, as its Chinese. Don't know when the updates stop as Xaomi stopped updates of its UI year after year for some 2-3 year old models too.Lately after purchasing Samsung Tab.. I am once again wooed and wowed by Samsung Quality & performance.Its SECURITY & PERFORMANCE that landed me here with M31S. I have no complains except for screenshot feature which is easy in Redmi & little cumbersome in Samsung, yet a 5* for everything from Samsung.  I admit and say that this M31S has a bundle of features to explore. The camera is very very impressive and pro mode is simply exquisite.",0.9516,positive

  Happy to switch to samsung phones from all other chinese phones i owned previously.Samsung has inbuilt device care app which manages the ram and saves battery and puts apps to sleep when not required. You also get samsung max premium VPN service for free although you will have to select the premium service from samsung max app bcz by default basic service is selected for everyone. Kindly note bcz the VPN is free its slow. Comes with Dolby atmos feature but ya dolby atmos can only be used with headphones and works with Bluetooth headphones too. What I liked about samsung is the dolby atmos feature provided is not there for show it really works amazing when you listen to real dolby atmos content using headphones on the phone . For me I am satisfied with this phone,0.9715,positive
"  Pros: -In hand feeling is great with unique gradient look.-The cameras of this one is just amazing. Photography might become ur hobby with the ultimate quad camera setup in this device.- Fingerprint sensor is modern and works really well.- Super amoled display and the speakers with punchy sound gives a completely different experience with the multimedia.-25 watts charger is the cherry on the cake.Cons:-A back cover could have been provided because the back is a fingerprint magnet.- A bit advanced processor could have made this phone an asset worth possessing (Only for hard core gamers).Conclusion- Being a moderate user, I am really happy with this Samsung device. It's a big competition to any other smartphones in this range in the market at this point of time.",0.9802,positive
"  Aesthetics :First of all the phone is very good to look at. The glossy finish on the back of the phone where the colours merge looks good. The one down side is back side of the phone is a finger print magnet and be ready to invest in a good back cover for the phone. It would be good if samsung provides a good cover in the package for the phone as they are providing for some models in the m series.Camera:The phone has good camera on paper and lives up to its expectations in the real world. in well lit scenario it provides very good results. The low light scenario is really challenging even for the top of the line phones. This phone is also no exception in low light scenario I see a bit of noise and loss of detail.Battery Backup:The big thing about the phone is the battery and it is able to hold the battery for two and half days of normal usage.Software Updates:One thing I remain skeptical is how long samsung will provide software updates, I think it is for 2 years but I would be happy if get for 3 to 4 years.Conclusion:So, if you are looking for a good phone under Rs.20000 this is a phone that will and should be in the first three places in your list of phones.",0.9583,positive
"  It's not about giving review, it's about sharing my experiences with someone who need to buy this from hard earned money.

Side finger print sensor is working than what you think, meanwhile faceunlock also working soo good.4. Battery stands upto 14hrs rough use, but I'm not try it more than twice.5. Edge to Edge perfection in screen looks and handy to use.6. Don't worry about price because Samsung 25W get know you it's perfect.7. UI 2.1 gives you different experience.8. PUBG is really working equal to other competitors.So why you should not buy this1. If you want a 5G network don't think about this mobile.2. Signal strength is not improved like other M series mobile, I feel its have to look by samsung.3. Battery save mode ( Medium power saving) not perfect as I seen before.4.

"  Feels good to hold. It is a plastic body but still seems quite premium.The camera is good. Not a flagship so  ant expect much. But a lot better than my  previous samsung s8. The single take feature is a load of c**p. Or maybe I haven't used it efficiently yet.Battery backup is simply awesome. Don't.  Have to keep plugging in. But again the 25w fast charging is a load of c**p. My previous moto g6 had 18w turbo charger and that worked a lot better. Though that battery capacity was low as well. But gave me equivalent backup.Screen is the best part. It's beautiful, huge and crisp with minimal pinhole obstruction. Good colour saturation and brightness. Face unlock is just a tad bit slow.

"  Simply brilliant! I definitely think this is the best phone to buy if one has the budget of about 20K. The battery is long lasting, the cameras are better than any other phone in its category and the screen is magnificent.The only little glitch is the fingerprint scanner on the left of the phone. It can be really uncomfortable for people with small fingers. And it isn't as responsive as it should be. I had to press at least  twice to unlock the phone. Maybe I am a bit too casual with my touch, but its definitely an issue.However, besides the above minor issue, I think this is a brillphone by Samsung for people who want to have a good viewing experience,  a great set of cameras and a long lasting battery.",0.9661,positive
"  Excellent photos with Sony IMX682, But low light captures are very poor. Battery is good, can manage two days with normal usage. A bit laggy while playing multiple games Simultaneously with 6 GB RAM. Anyways the screen is super amoled which is pretty much common in samsung devices, watch movies with super quality when compare with Chinese mobiles in this range.",0.9528,positive
"  All good. Comes preloaded with some 3rd party softwares, that was a bit irritating but all can be uninstalled. Great value for money though. Battery lasts full 24 hrs with heavy bluetooth usage with my earbuds and wireless ON all the time. Takes around 1.5 hrs to charge completely. It has Knox security but remember, it's not water proof so be cautious in rain and near pools, tanks, bathroom, etc. Feeling on screen is good. Great with multiple apps open at the same time. Do not forget to put TPU cover or armor guard with some screen guard. My friend dropped his 2 days old M31s from half a meter height and screen is shattered and gone black completely.  I think original screen replacement from the authorised service center is 8.5k. Better safe than sorry. Worth every penny for this price. I bought in prime day sale so got 1500/- additional discount.",0.9899,positive
  This is perfect for day to day usage with fantastic camera quality. There is no full version of Knox security. Processor is not for high gaming. Battery is descent but you can get 5830mah like battery life because of this processor.Display is awesome.And there is a hidden app lock system with samsung max app for data saving and privacy protection.Fingerprint sensor is very fast but face unlock is secure.There is a unique single take feature.And it is a non Chinese  phone.Build quality is awesome.Big screen bright writing  is very helpful for students.,0.9431,positive
"  Pros - This phone has monsterous 6000 mah battery, reverse charging and Samoled display. Coming about single take camera make this phone more interesting and look wise make this phone best under 20k.Cons - only con is processer. Exynos 9611 since 2 yrs samsung is using this processor in mid rangeOverall pubg is running smoothly because of optimization",0.9168,positive
"  Lets talk about the cons first.. the front camera struggles in low light, due to the charging cable being type c to type c.. one cannot use it as a data cable which is a little annoying. There is no TPU case or screen guard applied with the phone which makes the phone little more vulnerable and so we have to spend some extra bucks to get to that security.Pros are more than cons. The rear camera is really impressive, night mode too adds to its advantages, the front camera works like magic in good lighting condition. If we turn off the skin smoothness and beauty mode, it produces some good details. Battery life and the charging time is decent. Display is extraordinary. Sound is rich and loud. Don't worry about the processor, if you are not a gamer who streams and plays for hours, it is a perfect phone for you. It works lovely . Moreover it comes with Knox security.",0.9776,positive
"  This is just an ok product. I ""will not recommend"" it at this price. Only reason I bought this phone was because I did not want to buy a Chinese Phone.The performance of this phone is worse than a Chinese Phone.Only good thing is it's screen size and display.The phone isn't very fast to respond. It hangs frequently. Everytime I unlock this phone the application which is already open does not work.I have to close the app and open it again.The fingerprint sensor on the side button also requires getting used to. It locks often as we hold the phone in our hand as it starts recognising anything on the sensor as our fingerprints which fail to match.If you don't save all the WhatsApp images to your gallery by default, there is no option to save it manually. Such a pain.Google Chrome also won't update no matter what.",-0.2971,negative
"  The overall experience with the Galaxy M31s is great. I like the overall features of the phone specially the feather touch on the screen. For those who are looking for a battery life its a huge disappointment.Two major disappointments:1. Since the phone is new in the market, Samsung should have provided a better experience with One UI 2.5 or 3.0. But there seems to be no plans for the UI upgrade.2. I am a heavy user and the only reason for buying the phone was the massive 6000mah battery. But it seems to be a pretty much disappointment from Samsung. I have been using the phone for a week now and the battery does not perform as expected. I don't play games on the phone but daily uses like Paytm, google pay, Teams, Outlook, Gmail, WhatsApp. The battery does not long even for 8-9 hours. I am sure that it is a paid promotion from the vloggers that they mention about the 2-day battery life. I was expecting the phone to be charged every 2 days, but I have to charge the phone every day. If I want to have a 2-day battery then I have to use very cautiously like not using wifi, WhatsApp, or any sort of heavy use.",0.8366,positive
"  A Very Big Samsung Mobile Fan.First of all, loved the new Glastic design and the side-mounted fingerprint sensor which is very fast.A Very massive battery and the Amoled Display puts a cherry on the cake.The 64 MP intelli-cam is just Lit🔥🔥.The new infinity O display in M series was a great idea.The sim slot is also very unique.Currently using the Samsung M30s, M21, M31s. All of them are great considering their price point.Attached some of the Camera samples.Loved the Knox security in M-series.Reverse charging is a very useful feature.The 25W charger is also awesome.The image processing is awesome and very fast.",0.9657,positive
"  It is a very nice phone. Loved the always-on display. It's a very large and good display. I am playing casual games. The sound is loud. The battery life is good and fast charging helps to fill it quickly. There was no breakage for me on the Bluetooth front, I am pairing my Sony XM3 with this and I am not an audiophile but Dolby Atmos makes a nice hearing experience for me (XM3 is not Atmos-certified). The camera is also good enough for me (it has Sony cameras). I am not a pro photographer and ultimately all my photos are uploaded to google, so good enough camera for me. So it is a very nice purchase for me. And I hope every person buying this phone (instead of buying Chinese brands) have the same experience. Also do always buy insurance for your phone for at least the first year. I have seen many cases when it comes handy coz you never know when an accident (only to your phone) happens.",0.978,positive
"  I personally don't like cameras where it smudges your facial texture in the selfies/photos, this phone cam has a bit of same issue like other new phones where it shows as if u have a clear skin without any dark spots. Other than that landscape pics are very clear, still need to explore the Cam.Disappointingly, headphones not included in the package. No other offers in it like free scratch guard & back cover.Configuration is a bit tricky, opening a Samsung account, syncing, copying & all.Overall phone is good, look wise & applications in it. Love the colour combo, metallic Greyish-Silver & Blue.Will update after a few months, just got it yesterday.",0.9589,positive
"  Picked up the phone for my mom. Went for samsung as I didn't want to buy a phone manufactured by a Chinese company, if not would have definitely gone for xiaomi.Great phone. Loved every thing about the phone except the plasticky feeling of the back cover. Felt like I wasnt holding a  phone that costs around 20,000 ₹. Have redmi 8a dual and must say that the over all build quality of redmi 8a dual, which cost me around 7000/-₹ when it was launched, is better, at least the phone feels sturdy.Otherwise m31s is great phone. Camera and the picture quality great. The phones responsive. The finger print scanner at the side is a refreshing change.Would have rated it 5 if not for cheap plasticky feeling of the phone.",0.9639,positive
"  Its A real monster from Samsung M Series that I can't say in few words. Its really user friendly and Comfortable. Overall its too good in All Aspects.Pros* A Cool Design with beautifully arranged side keys* A Stunning AmoLED 6.5"" full HD Screen* A Beutiful 64+12+5+5 MP Rear and 32MP Selfie Camera* A Powerful 6000 mAh Battery* A Descent Samsung Exynos 9611 Processor* A Smart 6GB RAM With 128 GB Memory* A Comforatable Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection.Cons* Price is Liltle more when compared with Other Chinese mobile Phones.* Doesn't come with a back cover. So I bought a back cover. (Amazon Solimo brand).I was thinking about Cons and wasted so many time. Because it's a Kind Of Smart Device When beuty mets the Quality. Samsung Made it Possible.

"  Very bad expirience with Samsung as a company, I am a doctor who is dependant upon mobile so my patients can contact me at any hour. I had xiomi note Pro 7 working fine, due to china border problem ( being patriot) I decided to spend 20000 rs on samsung M31s and I did. On 26 th night sometimes my phone went blank,I came to know when my emergency covid patients relative  came knocking on my door at 4 am accusing me of putting off my phone which I did not do, Samsung m31s did. After working tirelessly for 25 yrs and even in pandemic I was accused of being careless thanks to Samsung. I have lost my patient reports, was not reachable, went to service station exposing myself to 20 people as Samsung has no social responsibility of maintaining social distancing in 80 Square foot space.I am throwing all my samsung things and will not ever buy anything from Samsung anymore and I advise everyone the same.Thanking youDr Sameer",-0.9371,negative
"  Wifi signal reception is too week as compare to Mi mobiles. Battery gets discharged bit faster than Mi mobiles.HOTSPOT signal strength is weaker than Mi Note 5 Pro.I would say Samsung must use better hardware if selling these mobile more costlier than redmi and other Chinese brands who are giving better hardware in less cost.I would not suggest to buy this phone regriously.Within a month of use, it has started HANGING even on basic apps opening, processor is not capable to handle basic process and apps.. DISAPPOINTED from SAMSUNG again.",0.3576,positive
"  Samsung Galaxy M31s is the latest offering from Samsung India in the M series of smartphones. Samsung Galaxy M31s is an excellent smartphone and will highly appeal to all Samsung fans in India. With an excellent camera setup which has many intelligent features, the camera enthusiasts will simply love this phone. The only thing that should have been upgraded by Samsung in this phone is the processor which should have been more powerful. The 6GB RAM 128GB storage variant costs ₹19,499 and the 8GB RAM with 128GB storage variant will cost ₹21,499. All in all, this phone is still highly recommended.

"  First and foremost this is a non-Chinese brand phone.Display:With Super amoled display u can ditch ur tv and enjoy the tv like experience in Samsung M31s. The blue filter option can protect ur eyes while viewing in low light.Camera:The best till now. U can stop carrying ur DSLR henceforth if u have Samsung M31s.Single take is a good option in camera where you can capture the best moments and it gives best photos, videos and boomerang.Macro lens option is another plus point to capture the tiny things.In daylight the picture u get out of 64 mp camera is the best.Other best ones in camera are slow motion, hyperlapse, wide angle camera and lot more are there to explore here.Battery:No need to carry a powerbank if you have Samsung M31s. With one time charging you can do browsing, watching movies, playing music, clicking pictures etc. all these in a day and still battery will have another 25% charge.Fingerprint reader is very quick.After 1 month usage of this phone, my recommendation is just buy this phone.",0.984,positive

The Camera quality is simply amazing. User interface is also very user friendly. It's truly value for money phone. I would have given 5/5 stars but I reduced 1 star because of following problems.Fingerprint reader sometimes doesn't identify and we have to use PIN.Also, Battery life is excellent, but charging fully takes approximately 3 hours which is too long considering 6000 mah.I would also suggest Samsung to come up with brighter and flamboyant colours especially for India to beat the competition for longer time.",0.9537,positive
"  I have used it for 4 days and i feel for the price,  its a wonderful device . Even though you will get a mobile with better specs from Chinese manufacturers in the same price range  but thats the trade off you need to bare if u want a non Chinese phone keeping  in mind the privacy and data of users .Let us look into the pros of this device- 6.5 inch s amoled screen  is dope , colors are too vibrant . I think this is the selling point of this device.-battery is 6000 mah and coupled with 25 w fast charger its insane . It takes little more than 2 hours to fully charge and lasts more than a day .- samsung UI is refined and comes with many features  .- camera is too good ,you will get clear and vibrant pics .- side mounted finger print scanner is ergonomically  placed.Few cons which I have noticed are- processor is weak , they should have upgraded it for the hardware they are providing  .- its good for day to day usage , works pretty fine but not for heavy gaming- although phone is not slippery but they should  have included a cover with the device .",0.9754,positive

"  Not as expected. Don't go for fast charging which is one of the slowest. Big battery has not made any difference. I was using phone which was using low battery but still used to get same usage time as i am getting on 31s. Charging takes more than double the time my earlier phone used to take. Photos looked OK. Finger print reader is absolute waste. Nothing more to tell as of now. Not at all worth for money. I waited and bought this as wanted to buy non Chinese, but completely disappointed. Adding - ctakes lot of time if charged from car charger. Even 1% increase takes hell lot of time. Other phones get charged 10 - 15% by thr time this phone charging increases by 1%.Don't know what to do. Samsung this is not good.",-0.9712,negative

Apps loads at same speed as 3GB RAM.Overall quality is average.Disappointed this time with samsung purchase,Color contrast is not as a premium phone amoled.Speaker lacks.At speakerphone, mic does not capture audio properly.Battery life is good.

"  Relieved that going through those countless reviews paid off. Almost bought M31 but then did not like the low light pictures from M31. As soon as i read M31s had a primary 64MP sony IMX682 sensor, knew my search was over.Pros:1. Camera quality exceptional, very impressed with low light and night shots.2. 6000mah battery lasts almost 2 days with decent usage. Dont need to fret about plugging in every night.3. Clean UI, very limited bloatware4. 1 year complete protection at very nominal priceCons:1. Side fingerprint sensor is too narrow for my male fingers. Could never open lock in one attempt. Very frustrating. Samsung should have gone with traditional finger print sensor placements at back or front. I guess on screen sensor is too much to ask at this price.2. Screen freeze, after unlocking screen if you were browsing or reading, have frequently observed scroll to freeze. Unless i press return or minimize window, scroll dosent start to work. Very surprised to see such major software glitch, hope samsung solves this in future software updates.All in all its a good package. I could over come the cons as for me pros out weight cons.  M31s launch had perfect timing for me as i was looking for a under 20k phone with decent battery, scpecs and an awesome camera. Non-chinese brand was a cherry on top.",0.9799,positive

"  I have been using this phone for a month now (6gb ram, 64gb rom variant) and here is my review:1. Build: The build is entirely plastic but does not feel cheap in hand. The gradient design at the back makes it real cool.2. Screen: The screen is one of the brightest and vivid. The colors come out really well and don’t  make the phone appear as a budget phone anytime. The media viewing is actually awesome.3. Battery: I take around 50-60 calls in a day; watch media for 2-3 hours. The battery lasts me the entire day (8am-9pm) and then I have to put it on charge again with 20% battery still remaining. The charger provided is 25w which takes almost 1.5 hours to charge the phone completely.4. Camera: The cameras are really good, especially the output from the primary on the rear one. The pictures are bright with good details in daylight. I also find the night mode to be better than most other phones at this budget. The selfie snapper is 32 mp with good images in daylight; the images appear soft and grainy in low light however.5. Software and performance: This is where the lag comes into play. The device is powered by a age-old exynos processor. I have felt stutters while using apps like youtube and whatsapp. When I minimise the youtube window and again go back to reopen it, sometimes I get only the audio with no video playing. Similarly sometimes whatsapp freezes while I try to take a picture. However, I think these are minor issues and can be fixed through software updates. All other apps run well. I am not a heavy gamer but games like subway surfers, ninja warrior run without any lags.6. Network and call: I have noticed many call drops and voice issues. The 4g connectivity is also not very stable (I use airtel). These again can be addressed through software updates.Overall it is a great budget phone with few software issues. This is the phone for you if you are on a budget of less than 20,000 bucks and a light to moderate user.",0.9904,positive
"  The phone has gone dead in 15 days and when we took it to the Samsung store, we were told that the motherboard is defective and needs to be replaced. The part is not available at the store and we are severely inconvenienced without a phone and having to visit the store during these Covid times. The phone cannot be replaced because the 14 day deadline is over, according to Samsung policy. This defect in a brand new phone is not our fault and we are very unhappy to get a defective and repaired phone in just a few days of using it. This is not expected from a reputed company like Samsung. Very upset. Would like this problem to be addressed urgently.",-0.9548,negative

"  The Exynos 9611 processor in this phone doesn't affect its performance experience in-person. You'll barely notice any performance lags in day to day tasks. Don't stick to spec sheet comparisons, you'll barely notice the difference in performance while using it side by side with other phones. It is a very solid and beautiful phone. Full charge in 1 Hr 45 min which is quite fast considering 6000 mAh battery. The screen is beautiful and cameras are great.'About phone' section shows it has Knox security but I don't understand why it doesn't have a secure folder option and any other option. Knox is there but I am confused about its purpose.Also, UI is scaled down and doesn't have a 3 finger gesture screenshot, no screen recorder, no edge lighting, and no Gcam support. Other than that everything is superb especially no bloatware and ads, unlike Chinese counterparts. Also, it has very good privacy control options. Also no issues in call reception and signal.",-0.6665,negative
"  I like the phone for a lot of things considering the price point it falls in. I use samsung S10 as my second phone and despite a bit bulkier than that because of the battery size, I like the touch sensitivity, the screen quality and crispness of the display and the touch sensitivity despite applying a screen guard.The battery lasts almost 1.5 days and the phone does not tend to hang. I use it as my office phone and Light gaming, so the screen real estate makes it easier to use the phone. I also would say that samsung has done a commendable job with the software, UI and there are a host of useful features similar to the high end S Series.... I find the earpiece sound to be quite loud and the speaker to be 3.5 on 5.You can go ahead and buy this phone if you are looking for a budget device that satisfies most of your requirements.",0.91,positive

"  Not at all happy with this phone from a reputed company. On the 10th day after purchase, I had kept it for charging in night and in the morning saw the screen to be blank and unresponsive. Took it to the service centre and they said the screen has broken due to fall. I felt that it was on the bedside table and may have fallen due to my movement in my sleep so asked them to repair it. The service personnel said that it is a new launch so parts are not available and he doesn't know how long it will take. I have still left it at the service centre and it's been a week, haven't heard from them.Most surprising thing is that Samsung says it has Corning gorilla glass 3 and Corning claims it to be scratch and drop resistant. But if thephone fell in my sleep from the bedside table which is 22 inches high and screen broke then all claims are false. It even had a screen guard installed. My several other phones have fallen many times but never broke. I will never ever buy a samsung phone again.Others should also think before investing their hard earned money in these times.",-0.8538,negative

"  I was very happy with my purchase, because I found this phone after doing a lot of research on the Internet comapring a lot of mid range phones. The 'M' series provide very very promising specs at their price points and even Samsung's own 'A' series starts at a price point ₹10000 higher for a similar specs phone in the 'M' series.What went wrong is that my phone's touchscreen went unresponsive on it's own about 7-8 after the phone arrived and i couldn't get a replacement from Amazon because of their ''7days'' return poilcy. And surprisingly I couldn't even get a replacement from the official several Samsung service centres, because they prompted me that ""The M series phones are malfunctioning quite a lot and replacement parts for this series is not being supplied by Samsung "". So i decided to get a refund coupon that could sadly be applied at ""Samsung Brand Offline Stores"" only!. So I ended up purchasing a Samsung Galaxy S10 Lite as an upgrade, because the Samsung 'A' series line-up is just so stupid, having the same specs as 'M' series and being ₹10000 costlier.",-0.2249,negative
"  Using from 5 days, Satisfied with the phone so far! Here's a real user review from my end:********Pros********•Premium AMOLED Display! enhances your streaming experience.•6000 mAh marathon runner with Fast juicing capacity of 25W•Fingerprint accurate & Fast•Cameras give excellent output for a regular user. For Camera Geeks, you have a plethora of features out there!•On Performance, it's snappy in day to day usage. Though not 90Hz, its touch response is smooth and it adds to performance!********Cons********•Graphic intensive Games like PUBG might lag!I've played PUBG, it performs smoothly upto 1hrs or when you play in Solo/Duo/TDM, But when you play with Squad, phone heats up a bit after 30 mins, lags & shows stutters on prolonged gaming!In simple, its for those who chill out with friends & not serious gamers!•Other cons: No major issues noticed, Will edit when I see one!*******Verdict********Who should buy?•It's perfect for those who then owned a 2yr old Mid-range/Budget Device or 1yr old Budget device! Someone who've used flagship earlier will be disappointed!•For those who don't game everyday•For those who want Camera ready phone giving best pictures!•For those who watch a lot of content, it might be a Mid-range device but a Flagship in Display!",0.9822,positive
"  Writing this review after few weeks of usage:Pros:1) Display: Probably one of the best display in this price range. Outdoor visibility is good, display is bright and vivid.2) Battery life: It truely lives up the hype of its battery. It's monster battery easily gets you a day with heavy usage and continuous usage and few time on gaming.3)Performance: The overall performance is excellent for day to day usage. Handles routine multitasking with ease. So far I haven't tried any heavy end games but I'm preety sure it can handle it with ease. Samsung is giving regular updates to make UI work smoothly.4) Camera quality: It is it's strength as well as bit of weakness. Overall general photography is good. You get a good color reproducibility in day light with Standard camera. In wide angle mode, image quality decrease and image tends to be over saturated at times. Night mode is okiesh but not great in extreme low light conditions. Selfi camera does great job for selfies and also for group selfies. Samsung has added lots of features in camera app to overshadow the shortcomings of camera in this phone. 64MP is just a number, don't fall for it. Regular 16MP mode shoots photos mostly upto the mark of most of the people. Overall Camera is not the best but above average for this price range.5) Fingerprint reader: Well it's fun to use. It's very precise and haven't been able to fool it yet, so feeling relaxed 😜. But accidentally you tend to unlock the phone though you don't want to. But with routine usage, you'll learn how to avoid it.Cons:1) Weight: With this huge battery inside it, the phone weighs heavy. If someone has habit of putting it in upper pocket of shirt, it will be difficult for day to day handling.Overall, it's more than a value for money phone and a definate upgrade over M31. Go grab one for yourself.",0.9855,positive
"  It is only  non Chinese brand. Other than not value for money.Fingerprint reader works well.Battery life is good enough.Camera quality is not comparable with my very old phone Gionee Elife E8(2015) and Nokia N8(2010). It is laggy and not delivered sharp photos as my old Phone. So I have to wait for Google Pixel 4a. Samsung Galaxy M31s actually made for modern girls(slim design and beauty cam). I am not a gamer nor so much app user. But I've noticed this mobile is laggy. In every time when I open Google Photos in my high speed wifi, it takes much time than my 5 years old gione elife e8(3gb ram). Who have this mobile they will agree with me. Because my mobile (Samsung Galaxy M31s) is not defective, it is OK condition.  But it has limited capability and capacity which is not worthy for this price segment.",0.824,positive

With the ppi over 400 the quality of the display is absolutely fantastic. For media consumers this is a gift and the massive battery combined you can go on and on watching your favourite shows on this beautiful display.Coming to the charger it is 25 Watt and it comes IN-THE-BOX which is GREAT!The charger will take the massive 6000 mah battery from 0 to 100 in about 1 hour and 50 mins which is great and enough for most of the people and the back-up you get from it is good too.Overall:Great phone for daily use and content consumption with great display and great battery life.If you are looking for a phone for gaming I wouldn't recommend this.

Earphones , not included in the package is disappointing.  Fast charger is great. Biometric scanner on side home button is not convenient. NFC is also a miss. Cameras are excellent .Overall a  five star deal. Thanks Amazon.PS Please take care while buying covers for this model.

"  I purchased this phone going by the rave reviews but it turned out to be a huge disappointment. The selfie camera is just okay. Haven't been able to test the rear camera that much due to the pandemic situation. Phone is slow and hangs when using multiple apps and switching between them. It also hangs when you turn off the screen while using an app and then turn it back on. Sometimes one has to click several times on action items to get a response. Fingerprint scanner takes an entire second for thumbs. I ran all the benchmark tests and this phone fared very poorly for it's price bracket. I had Redmi Note 7 Pro before this and even that fared significantly better. All I can say is that it was more of a downgrade than an upgrade for me.

It has 64 mp camera, 6000 mah battery and it charges so fast with new C charger at 25 w. It is handy and not to much weight. It has wireless calling facility too. One thing which gave me tension was the low audio volume of incoming calls. Suddenly i started worrying about my hearing capability. Then went through the settings and found that the default volume was kept for under 30 years old. May be the mobile took me to be one below 30 years and I am happy about that too. But my  Ears were not happy. Then Eureka !  I found here is a facility to personalise the audio volume too. This I am posting because  in  many  elderly persons face  with this hearing problem.Cons-------The  inward audio is kept on top but sometimes give trouble particularly when you have mobile  back cover. Same way face recognition is not very successful.",-0.8328,negative

"  Decent for day to day use but with some irritating issues and some useful functionality miss.Phone has a powerful battery, no doubt about that. Where my earlier phones with 3200 mAh battery used to drain twice a day, this phn doesn't break a sweat it easily lasts for 1.5 day. Although 6000mAh battery increases the weight of the device significantly.Look, Display and design of the phone are amazing. Looks good at both front and back. Gradient bacl gives phone a premium lookMemory management : Samsung does not live up to expectations here. I was using a 6GB Realme 3 pro before this but never had  my phone freeze or hang, but this ""Monster"" by Samsung is not so good to handle applications, I have seen high RAM consumption and device do hang sometimes which is quite irritating given it being an 8 GB memory phoneFingerprint sensor : probably most impactful irritating thing with this phn is the side button fingerprint sensor. It is not very smooth, takes time, since surface area is small, finger misses it many a time, and sometimes if my finger touches it while picking up the phone it gets disabled for 30 seconds or so. Surely never going for side button sensor ever again.Camera: Ohh the biggest disappointment. From the setup which it boasts of quality of pictures is not up to the mark. Night mode is not the best in segmentMissing Utility apps: When some companies are offering many utility features that can be useful, this phone lacks such features . Team can research by looking at some other phones and introduce new features to increase utility.So by the overall review it is not a phone I would buy if I had any non-China product with decent reputation. But since we do not have any other option I think it is a phone I can live with. Hopefully we will have better Indian players in this segment and then we can have some improvements",0.9373,positive
"  The product is nice from its price prospective. Samsung has really gone ahead since last year pushing lot of features in its One UI which also looks great with its AMOLED display. In terms of display I think currently non of the other brands/neither its own predecessor are in competition with Samsung. The phone looks premium because of its glasstic appearance and a slight curve around the front pannel nevertheless the material is rightly said as plastic. Careful selection of tempered glass is essential as to protect the screen. The battery seems to be preety good. Started setting up the phone with allmost 50% took around 5 to 6 hours to complete setting up the phone and the battery was still at 46% and after allmost a day later it is at 38%...quiet impressive. But have to bear in mind even it's bunduled with a 25W fast charging adapter it will take atleast 60 to 120 minutes to fully charged. Let's move to sound, I think the speakers are ok ok type as you maynot feel the quality bit distorted, however with nice set of headphones along with Dolby Atmos plus UI sound settings the sound quality is nice. Moving to the next segment front camera, I felt it could have been improved with indoor shots you can easily she the selfies are whitewashed, there are ampule of options to edit but the major part is how the original image appears, so I am not quiet impressed with front camera. Primary camera is nice indoor shot was good. Need to try with night mode.",0.9832,positive
  I love the phone barring the below cons1. Due to processor the UI lags sometime2. No case or screen guard in the box3. Screen gets scratched easily without screen guard may be due to Gorrilla Glass 34. No samsung features like Alt Z available only core variant of One UI given5. Wifi speed are less not sure why.Pros1. Excellent Screen for media2. Good Battery life as due to processor getting only 7 hours screen on time. But the SD counter parts are getting same even with 5000mah battery3. Fast FP sensor4. 25w charger5. 3.5mm jack,0.1801,positive

"  1.Best budget phone under 20k throughout any brand..best thing is its non chinese unlike those fancy companies..Superb camera quality, superb Portrait shots2.Battery life doesn't seem like 6000mah..ita last 1 day easily with moderate to heavy usage3.Screen is that thing which anyone will fall for..feels like a RO water display so much detail so much crisp. Movies with a earphone or good quality sound box feels like theater at home4.selfie is not that great ok ok tye5. Always on display feels Premium6. Daily normal usage feels buttery smooth unlike the gaming in it.7. Main problem is Internet, i feel internet runs slower than other devices8. As my title Little compromise so the compromise is its processor..Too much outdated now..now 7nm processors are coming and samsung still using Exynos 9611 10nm architecture processer which is a little disappointing.. rest is good9. Back panel feels extremely premium if u don't use the back cover but a back cover is recommended for long term premium fit and finish.10. Fingerprint reader fails 6/10 times if u don't set ur finger properly  Don't overthink just buy this phone u will never ever regret this deal for upcoming 1-2 year.. Good luck",0.9319,positive
"  The moment I unboxed this amazing phone, I was in awe of how it was made. It's amazing at all the aspects Samsung boasts. First off, I'd like to tell you about the processor, the Exynos 9611 chip, it's one of the finest from Samsung and is also found in it's more premium and high range 'Galaxy A Series' like the Galaxy A50 and more. Secondly I'd like to tell you about the display, it's mesmerizing is all I could say. The Gorilla Glass 3 makes the screen all the more protective from scratches and also buttery smooth. It comes in 6GB and 8GB RAM models and either one of them would perform proactively and at it's best.The 6000 mAh battery is to look out for most in this smartphone. In simpler words. It just never quits! You just have to charge your phone once till 80-85% (in my case) and you're good to go for another whole day and still be left with enough juice to go on about the rest of the day without charging it halfway.The 25 watt super fast charging proves to be a champ in charging the phone at a blazing fast speed, leaving you worriless about the time consuming practice.The phone is a sleek looking one albiet it's also just a little bit heavy because of the insane 6000 mAh battery it consists of. Overall it looks amazing in your hand and it had that head-turning-vibe.Sony IMX68 sensor in the cameras prove to be a supreme highlight of the phone, it can take crystal clear pictures effortlessly. The night mode, the food mode, the slow-mo, the 4K mode, and even the normal 720 & 1080p modes are wonderfully constructed by the software. Like I said, this is a finely crafted smartphone. On top of that the side mounted finger print sensor does it's job simply and efficiently (which also means blazingly fast) for you to nothing but simply 'tap' and bam, you have your phone unlocked.Surprisingly, this phone, though being a mid-ranger model, is protected by Samsung's top notch security software 'Samsung Knox' which, if speaking in simple terms, if you have this phone, you can go about doing stuff on it like you usually do and leave the hard work to Samsung for protecting your device against brand new as well as age old malwares and viruses.",0.9861,positive
"  I bought this phone with some confusions as it's having Exynos 9611 processor and Glasstic back, but after buying it I'm fully satisfied. I know chinese companies are giving Snapdragon within this price range but Exynos is a good processor for non gamers and day to day usage. It performs smoothly and honestly I haven't seen any lags. And the most important thing is you are geeting the brand value of Samsung.Pros-1. Great Display- Super Amoled display with drop notch makes the viewing experience great 👍2. Big Battery- I'm a heavy user but still I get 1.5 day's battery backup. It comes with 25 watt fast charging which charges it's 6000 mah battery within 2 hrs.3. Brilliant Camera- There is no doubt one would get the bestest camera in this price range. The main 64 MP camera with Sony IMX makes it the best. Samsung's intellicam works great even the night mode and macro camera works fine. And the 32 MP front camera is superb.4. Weight Distribution- The weight of this phone is almost 203 gm. as it's having 6000 mah battery but Samsung managed the weight very good, and it doesn't feel heavy in hand.5. 3.5 mm headphone jack6. Good audio output with dolby atmosCons-1. Glasstic back- if you don't use cover there is a high chance of scratches.2. No TPU case- Samsung should have provided a tpu case within the box but they didn't so you have to buy it separately.3. Gorilla glass 3- It's time to give gorilla glass protection 5 as consumers are paying 19k-20k.Overall one can definitely go for this phone as it's non Chinese and a great deal within this price range. I'm very happy with this phone.",0.998,positive

"  The phone is actually nice. But nothing is perfect after all.1. The camera quality is amazing. But the screen starts to flicker when we try to use the slow motion video feature.2. Battery life is fine. If you keep the mobile data switched on all day till you sleep, the battery drains which should not happen easily as it is said be of 6000mah.3. The main problem is that the vibration feature doesn't turn off. It doesn't have any option to turn off vibration for messages.4. Operating system is good. Not faced any problem till now.5. The samsung keyboard should be upgraded a bit. It is easy to type on Google keyboard but not on this keyboard.So in my opinion, this cannot be a ""MUST"" buy but surely a good buy.",0.9551,positive

"  If you are reading this review it means you are interested to buy This New Beast from the house of Samsung. Trust me it's a beast. Firstly let me clear something, I am not a gamer and mostly played light weight games just to fill up vacant time. Now coming straight to the point. Before having this device I was using Samsung A50 which was also a pretty good device, and just before that I used to have one plus 6 which is also a good device comparing the other brand available in market but during that time I never felt that Samsung can improve such way, and the result is M31S. It's a champ if I talk about battery life, touch sensitivity, fingerprint scanner sensitivity, screen quality ( It's super amoled), sound quality, network reception, no call drop issue, crystal clear sound from earpiece as well as from loud speaker which has pretty decent loud but soothing sound considering the price. Now come to the main highlighted point by Samsung which Camera, I am very much impressed though I don't use this feature very frequently but it can capture sharp and clear images. But as you know no one is perfect in this world so this device has also some drawbacks but can be overlooked easily if you want to have a good smart phone where your personal data is at lower risk. Cons: Camera makes images little over saturated, Some applications need time to get open and close (It seems they got hanged but soon they will be operational) which can be fixed through a software update. And it has Knox security. Thanks for your valuable time. Keep supporting Samsung and allow them to do good work.",0.9973,positive

"  I was using Samsung Galaxy M30 - 6 GB-128 GB - 5000 mAH - Tri Camera - 13 MP for not more than a year. I replaced it with Samsung Galaxy M31s - 8 GB - 128 GB - 6000 mAH - Quad Camera - 64 MP AND I literary found no any difference in both.1. The 4th camera - Micro Lens - is totally useless. It is not at all a micro lens. It gives the same results as close shot by any other lens.2. The 5000mAH battery of  M30 was better than 6000 mAH battery of M31s. I was getting M30 backup till night 9 - 9.30 pm and now I can get backup till 7 pm with same usage.3. The ram again is not make much difference. I doubt Samsung really has using the given configuration and improved the design.Finally, it was my WRONG decision to go for M31s. It is useless.",-0.8139,negative

But it is way more secure than other android phones from different brands.Value for money - 9/10.Overall - 9/10, if you are not into gaming and would like a phone which does absolutely well in other aspects, then this is the phone for you.",0.9662,positive
"  The screen went black on 16th September, i.e. after about one month's use. Samsung Service Centre initially said that there is some software issue. Later on they said that the mother board needs to be replaced and they don't know how long it would take. The matter was taken up with Samsung and nothing has been done so far. After six days, the repair status on their website says that the service order is cancelled because warranty papers have not been received by them, which is absolutely rubbish because their Service Centre accepted the phone only after verifying the warranty details.

"  This is the BEST BUDGET PHONE samsung has ever made. i wanted to add a photo of the phone but after using the phone, I don't feel like taking pictures with other phones.To start with, when I did the unboxing, I felt like I was holding a premium device the minute I took it out of the box. To be honest, It feels more premium than ₹80k phone. Here's my take on the phone....Biggest Improvements -1. The camera (64MP) is flawless and capture details with amazing contrast. Intellicam feature is just AWESOME.2. The side mounted fingerprint sensor. It is the faster than many flagship phones I have ever used.3. The Punch-Hole camera (infinity-o) Display. It is just BEAUTIFUL.4. 4k video support. Just love it.5. The battery (6,000 mAh) get me going for 2 days without charging.6. 25 watt (type c to type c) charger is included in the box and fully charges my phone (0-100) in 1h15m. Perfect !!7. The AMOLED screen is the biggest highlight. Plus Samsung makes the perfect displays.8. Expandable Storage upto 1 TB plus dual sim slots. Highly user friendly.9. Selfie camera (32mp) is very very very sharp.10. Other amazing features like, latest software, scheduled dark mode, scheduled blue light filter, etc make it the best buy ever.Biggest Downside-NONEMy SuggestionSTOP THINKING AND BUY IT RIGHT AWAY.

  This is my review after 1st impression of Smasung M31. The phone looks cool a bit bulky but that's okay it has a humungous 6000mah battery. Screen is outstanding. Battery is marvelous.

"  Samsung Galaxy M31s, I ordered this phone in Amazon's first sale on 7th August. And this phone was delivered to me on the 13th of August.  So I am reviewing this phone today on September 9, after using it for 27 days.Design : This phone is very good in terms of look and design.Display : The screen is very good, no problem watching videos and browsing the internet.Camera: The camera of this phone is also very good. Captures high resolution in 64 megapixel.Front Camera: The front camera does not take clear pictures, it makes it slightly fed up.Touch Response : Touch response is also very good, no problem. No lag problems were seen yet.RAM Management : RAM remains in memory for a long time. RAM management is very well optimized.Sound : Speaker volume is very loud but not like stereo speaker.Internet Speed : Any website opens in seconds. Internet speed is also great.Battery : I noticed a battery drain issue in this phone. I don't know if the other user's phone has a battery problem or not, but the automatic battery in my phone keeps getting low. And while using the phone, 1% of the battery runs out in 3-5 minutes. Sometimes 7 to 9% of the battery in the phone ends up on its own in a few hours. It seems that a 6000 mAh battery is equivalent to 4000 mAh.Heating : This phone also has a heating issue, sometimes when charging the phone, the temperature reaches 48 degrees and 42 to 43 degrees in normal use. And in WhatsApp calling, the phone gets very hot and the call is cut automatically.PROS :Good Camera QualityBetter PerformanceFast ChargingAwesome Display QualityCons :Battery Drain issueHeating issueI hope Samsung resolves these issues in the next update.",0.8864,positive

Depth Camera works well with 64mp.12mp ultra wide angle is great. Macro Shot works well. 32mp front is clear den other selfie cams. Single take features is Awesome. The preloaded filters are great. AR Zone is Awesome. Feels Great in hand. Looks are awesome. Premium finish with protective design. Awesome battery I just charge it full in the morning n use it whole day n night to charge it in the morning again. 25W charger help charge faster. Side mounted fingerprint scanner is very very very very fast. This phone only have one drawback that is it's processor Exynos 9611, thats an old one. But I haven't faced any problem using the phone with this processor.

"  This smartphone is  awesome!! I have had it for about 18 days and it is great!!Here's  a detailed review:Build Quality- Although  the material  is glastic , the whole gradient look is quite awesome and almost seems to be metal . A little tip though, invest in a good clear back - cover if you don't want to  get your fingerprints  all over it.Camera - The 64 MP rear camera is great !! It captures every single detail beautifully.The ultra-wide lens is far better than several others in the same price range and has near to none curvature of field .Macro-camera is simply phenomenal!! You can 'see' the 5MP in all the details. It could even capture the pollen grains on the inside of a flower!!The night mode is works like magic !! It transforms photos at dusk to photos of a jovial afternoon. And the Single take ! It's  perfect for capturing one - time occasions like Birthdays.Display- It's Samsung people!! You know the display is going to be the best !! The punch hole camera really does make quite the difference from M31.Fingerprint Sensor- Instantaneous!! And the position is optimum. After a while, it almost becomes instinct.Battery- Monster!! Absolute monster !! It can power through 2 days of mild usage and 25 W fast charging..I don't  even have to plug it in for a hour to get it from 20% - 100 %!!Software and Performance - Neat. It's seamless. The One Ui 2.1 feels great. I have to say .. In the set-up it does try to install a great deal of apps but still other than that, I see no problem.  Some of Samsung's Own apps are great..I have run several games at once on this thing but still , not a lag.Verdict- Go for it !! If your looking for a phone under 20k , this is the best  you'll  find . The display, the battery, the camera everything feels perfect .",0.9911,positive
"  The camera quality simply superb and battery backup is better. The performance was comparably better with other models. My suggestion is good to buy.All aspects of the phone are on par or above the next segment.The display is gorgeous.Lookwise, it doesn't feel like an M series phone.FP sensor works well although it can store only 3 fingerprints.However, it has some good outputs6000mah battery with 25W fast charging is awesome. (Got reverse charging as well).The dimensions are also the same as A51. So you can use the same tempered glass but cant use the A51 back cover for M31s since it should have the cutout for side-mounted fp scanner.",0.8719,positive
"  Amazing phone with outstanding battery .  Really a monster phone as advertised by Samsung . I have been a iPhone user and just thought of trying something not very expensive from Samsung stable and bought this phone on Amazon and this has not disappointed me even a little bit .Using Samsung M31S for last 3 weeks and can vouch that its quite a decent phone for those who want a large display , long lasting battery , lot of internal storage , super fast & reverse charging .Just a small manufacturing defect - small rubber protruding from back cover but that was not related to performance so can say overall a very good phone at a decent price .",0.9156,positive
  I booked M31s on 6th August 01 AM but it's deliver to me on 15th August. I'm using 6/128 GB variant.Please don't buy exynos 9611. Except photography and display nothing is special to me. In photography also u will find a problem if u r going to capture a business card or like that you'll not get clear on edge to edge. This you'll find when you're going scan through any scanner app too. Not OTG compatible. Kirin 659 also better than Exynos 9611.In a single line i can say I'm very much disappointed.,-0.7704,negative

"  Nothing great in this mobile,lot of social media hype, I purchased this to avoid china mobiles, but a 100% disappointment from samsung I will never go for samsung mobile again in my life time , frankly it is like a China mobile with build quality ,plastic body, camera  Nokia 2mp is better than this ,worst camera experience, 30s is bad in camera what my wife is using, 31s is more worst camera than 30s, waste of money it is like 7k budget mobile, my earlier redmi 3s prime is 100%better,I ordered redmi note 7 pro for my father before lockdown for 8.5k, which is very nice in camera point of view. I strongly recommend don't go,weight of mobile also more",-0.8749,negative
"  1. I have disappointed with front camera, it is 32 mega pixels but the quality of photo's is not really good,  when you zoom the pic it's not looking clearly.2. Samsung is not providing ear phones, screen guard or cover case.3. Charger is having C3 connection, so charger cable is having C3 pin for both the sides. so you can use cable for reverse charging with other devices but we can't use same cable to connect with USB or power bank.4. Even it is 6GB RAM the mobile is not so quick to respond.5. 6000mah battery for new mobile  it is coming 1 day if we use data continuously.6. But good thing is single take photo option.",-0.1616,negative
"  Everything about the phone is just perfect.Camera is great, even in low light it captures light well. Even My OnePlus 6 does not capture that amount of light in night mode.Battery life is really good. Only thing is it takes time to get it 100% charged, but that's again because of 6k battery size.Looks are just awesome, the screen is dynamic and feels premium. Colors are vibrant as well.Sound quality is good, it does have Atmos. I still have to explore that option, but I hope it delivers good sound.The side finger scanner responds slightly slower if you have used some other high end mobiles. But I think it's is not something which will slow down the performance.Watching 4k videos is just amazing. You will love it.Overall I would say, it's much premium feel and does the job well. I am using OnePlus 6 as well, but really happy with this M31S phoneJust go for it",0.9949,positive
"  Its been around 2 weeks I am using this phone. Lets talk about the drawbacks first--It can store only 3 fingerprints.-If you leave the app open and open the phone after sometime, the app doesn't respond. I find it quite irritating. I thought its in my phone only so I ordered a replacement from Amazon, they did it without any issue. but new phone has same issue.-Weight is much more to hold it for long in hands. :(Things I like- - Monster shot - Amazing- Screen resolution and quality display is commendable.- In this price, there is everything that others 'good brands' are delivering almost at double.Lets see how it goes.... :)",0.9469,positive
  I got this phone less than one month ago. It does not have any protection from water.the phone was accidentally dropped in less than half feet of shallow water and was removed within seconds.But the display stopped working.The samsung service centre in hyderabad checked it and said that a charge chip which connects display is gone.But the irony is that part is not available at samsung service centres in Hyderabad. I am calling up all the samsung service centres in hyderabad but couldn't get the spare part. Waiting for the service centres to get the parts in a week or so.  This clearly shows how delicate the phone is and most importantly samsung has not made available the required spare parts to its service centres. Keeping my fingers crossed and hoping for an early miracle.,0.9479,positive
"  Device is just too good to view content in very aspect. A 6000mah battery haven't impressed a lot becoz of obsessed ONE UI running in the background, but it took me for a walk all over the day. No complaints on ram management and app response times with no lag. Though a glastic back, which can be covered by a premium back case, the screen seems to be flawless and perfect. I had some network issues with the device in my area. Network grasping of the device near villages where we usually feel very low network ranges is very poor. I tested this with my other two mobiles and came to know that data speeds are very low on m31s. But in towns and cities and places near to celltowers the network speeds are amazing.Camera is most attractive featute of the device. Thanks to its fantastic dynamic range.Overall, the device is a perfect all rounder at the price point with many pros and little cons. Not to say perfect, but stands out on its mark.Maynot be a value for money product but you can go for it blindly if you are day to day user.SATISFIED WITH THE PRODUCT.",0.979,positive
"  While i was searching for a non-chinese phone - Samsung came to my rescue, it was about to release M31s, a replica of M31 - with very few minor enhancements. Was eagerly waiting for it and at last ordered on the launch date.Ordered at midnight!! A class delivery - reached quickly on 10 Aug.The expectation was almost met with the phone - with the satisfaction of not using a Chinese phone.I am not a gamer, so did not notice a drop in performance so far.Display is crystal clear and camera is good. Yet to experience in depth camera features.Finger print scanner is descent enough and face recognition is also good - though disabled it.The battery life is good and stands for 1.5 days with complete basic usage - WA/Mails/Calls.I have to come back after a better usage in a month or two.I agree on the decision to stop earphones, as we have our own desires on the model - but I would recommend Samsung to add a basic silicon back case going forward in the box - so that we can use it from day-1 with ease. This phone was quite slippery, so had to handle with extra caution. I ordered the case, on the same launch day.Overall good, but the price could have been much more competitive - as almost the same price as M31.On a side note - i also saw some bad experience with few Users where the phone did not start-up and went dead in 2 days. I think those are very rare conditions and could happen with any electronic gadgets. Samsung/Amazon should definitely get back to these clients and serve them as quick as possible, to maintain the customer service.",0.948,positive
"  Samsung M31s - Good camera quality with high-resolution pictures. Perfect battery backup. I use this phone the whole day after a full charge and the phone has a good battery backup. I like the phone and pictures clicked from this phone is far better than the other phone in the same price range. I love the Samsung m31s quality and processor. Almost perfect in the given price range. Value for money.The sound quality is also good in videos, youtube, songs, and also in video recording.",0.9794,positive
  I received the phone which had it's screen damaged on the edge. And I have to return it. Not sure how they claim it to be gorilla glass..Camera is good.But disappointed that it's no more available in stock.,-0.8467,negative
  Battery life and camera quality is good but the Samsung chipset is still the old one and this can pass you off sometimes. Your phone will start handing as soon as you do multitasking . This happens even when you are not playing any games or even not using any heavy application.Also the camera quality is good but it is definitely not 64mega pixel.I am writing this review after 10 days of using this phone.,0.8157,positive
"  The product is undoubtedly a market mover I. Its range, keeping in mind the fact that this is a Non-Chinese, trustworthy brand that is made as well as assembled in India. Now talking about the phone, the UI is amazing. Previously, I owned a Samsung J series smartphone and then switching to this is such a lovely experience for me.I have done a full charge test, and believe me the fast charging is an icing on the cake which unexpectedly comes with this handset. My phone took a total, to charge its monster 6000 mAh battery, 107 minutes from 0-100%. The optimisation truly works. The battery backup is good, sound and video qualities are Uber awesome. Camera is well designed. Screen looks premium that you may find in samsung flagship models. All in all, I'll give you a big thumbs up if you have made up your mind to buy this phone.The only problem with me is the processor, it could have been better than this when we are paying more than 20k for this. Never mind, I am more than happy with the chipset and processor because I am not a very heavy user. I hardly play any high-graphic games on this. For me, it works good.If you want a phone that meets all your expectations in a range of 20k, blindly go for this. I have the 8 gb 128 gb variant, and I got a flat discount of INR 1500/- through my HDFC credit card on the prime day sale on 5th of this month. If the offer is still there, go and avail it if you've a HDFC credit card with you.",0.9901,positive
"  Review after 20 days usage:Highlights:1. A WOW display ! - A vivid display with stunning colours and sharpness, which makes an amazing viewing experience. Videos and photos are a pleasure to watch.2. Battery - 6000 mAh monster battery - easily lasts for more than 30 hours with average usage3. Design - A more premium looking smatphone at this price segment4. Camera - 64 MP quad camera surely lives upto its expectations. A plethora of options to exploreWhat could have been better:1. Fingerprint sensor - the side mounted finger print sensor could be annoying at times. Not so fast2. Taking screenshot is not so easy - a simple button in the top navigation panel could have been awesome.The overall performance in my last 20 days of moderate usage has been excellent. The touchscreen works smoothly. So far, I dint encounter hanging while using any of the apps. A very satisfying and pleasant experience so far with the mobile.",0.9795,positive
"  This phone makes me saying this, you can't judge Samsung by just its specs. Using this phone from last 5 days, and believe me, it worth every single penny, I spent, At least for me.Upgraded from OnePlus 3T, and reason behind loving this phone is, it's epic display and buttery one UI. And, this are the only thing I care for, because I am not a gamer, so 9611 is more than required for me. As far as there is no lags in UI, it's fine for me, and there is no lags at all.In hand feel is also good, while holding this no one can agree that it is having 6000mah battery, Thumb up for this. I was able to pull out ~9 hr of screen on time. And speakers are also enough loud and clear.If you are not a HARD-CORE gamer then go for it. (Reason behind highlighting hard-core, many people play 2-3 rounds of pubg and refer themselves hard-core gamer, No you are not. And who plays games like COC, you don't even need to think)Let me tell you again, It's UI and Display is insanely great. After this, I really really think, OnePlus's Oxygen Os is totally over-rated.One more thing, Samsung do not provide case and screen protector out of the box, this is not a big thing, still annoying.",0.9701,positive
  Facing issue into network connectivity. I've 2 Airtel number and on calling to the number using in samsung galaxy m31s most of the time I've says the number you have dialed is out of network coverage area while on second or third try the call is successfuly connected and again after some time same thing repeating again. On other number using in different device has no issue.Trying to test one or two more days if the issue persist then I'll try to replace it,0,positive
  Super quality smart phone by Samsung.It is a best phone under 20k.Pros:-1. Best camera ever. It captures real quality images. If u compare the photos with one+ Nord then Samsung wins.2.

There is no data speed indicator. You can't know your data speed and data usage in your top bar. If u scroll down the screen then also it is not available.4.

"  Must Buy in the mid range . Best Display , Best Camera , Smooth Performance.1. PERFORMANCEThe performance of this phone is perfect. BUT NOT FOR HEAVY GAMERS . Normally 1-2 hours of PUBG is OK but not for several hours. Its processor is bit Older but its optimization is so much good . You will not face any single issue regarding its performance.Fingerprint Sensor is working smoothly. But face unlocking takes few seconds as i think it is for security purpose only. You can change the face recognition settings to fast mode.2. CAMERAIts Camera is the main highlight in this phone.it shots pretty impressive pictures . If you are selfie lover then GO for it. It wont disappoint you. In low light also it takes quite good pictures.3.BATTERYUhh!! It has a huge monster battery of 6000mAh. You can understand the backup of this phone. I cant say anything about its battery. Don't bother about its battery backup.4.DISPLAYThe samsung AMOLED displays are in TOP in the market. Awesome display I can say...........................................................................................................................................................................................And Yeah Samsung gives variety of features in this phone. You will find interesting about it.Till now i haven't got any issue regarding this phone.NOTE  :  NOT FOR HEAVY GAMING.Overall a Best Phone .I hope this finds you HelpfulThank You..",0.9974,positive

"  I mostly like the camera which has a lot of great features, the main part is the awesome battery lasts up to 12 hours of continuous usage of apps and games. Usually, I start using my phone morning 7 and it lasts till evening 7 and the 25 W superfast charger charges my phone within 1hr 40min, and it uses Exynos 9 octa 9611 it uses a 10 nm semiconductor which is a little bit old processor even it is old it performs great because it has multiple core support(4x2.39Hz with 9 octa-core) and Mali G72 mp3 GPU so in gaming pubg mobile can be played in HD High without lag and it gives seamless multitasking you can switch between games and other apps easily with a single Slide Navigation bar gestures). I have not used mobiles with Samsung's Exynos processor, I just brought this as a try but this amazed me. The fingerprint scanner and face unlock is very fast and the display is great, it comes with an infinite-o-super Amoled display and I can watch my favorite series and movies on Netflix and Prime video in 1080p and I can experience the Dolby atmos in wired and Bluetooth headphones or earphones The gradient color and design is elegant I love it so I've brought a transparent case and it is also secured by Knox you can see in settings and also when the phone gets booted up. I heard that this was the competition for one plus Nord, by my experience, it does with the camera and battery and other things are the same. This is the best phone at this budget.",0.9935,positive

Quality of photos it churns out is unbelievable, comparable to oneplus in my opinionBattery life is definitely not a problemA few pointers so you make the best lf the phoneThe processor is good but a bit aged. For best performance, switch to a static wallpaper and Remove the unnecessary apps that can be removed and disable the rest. I use the nova launcher as it's faster than Samsung's home screen.All in all, it's a phone that's amazing to use and really I'm impressed with the camera",0.9821,positive
"  See.. I'm being a tech enthusiast, writing this review!!! I've used this phone for almost 2 weeks!! See first of all I'll tell u that if u r a gamer don't prefer this phone..if u are a normal user u can choose it!!I'm being a student I faced no problems or any bugs using this phone!! The One UI which is the latest one is very user friendly and gives u a Very premium experience while using this phone..See, in a phone the hardware is important but the software should be optimised too otherwise there's no use of being a high level hardware..see it's battery is the best.. display is very amazing..6.5"" sAmoled display is a decent size but it's colors and saturation is very Greattttt guys!! Trust me, if u want a non Chinese phone under 20k it's the best thing u can get for a normal user like me!! I use the phone from 9am to 11pm continuosly nearly I keep my phone for 2 or 3hrs aside,It gives me a full day battery experience..I charge 1time in morning bas! So battery is the best!! Thumb's up 👍🏻 Now coming to camera it comes with sony imx 682 sensor which clicks very accurate photos in day and night too!! See for this price the night shots are also good not that bad!! If u will use night mode for low light shots it can click the best...but if there's very less light then better use flash😉 So conclusion is u can buy this phone and it justifies it's price so u can go for it!!🤟🏻",0.9929,positive

"  The overall product is good but the camera is pathetic. Being the 64 MP it has very poor image resolution. The picture quality gets deteriorated on just zooming it. The front camera being 32 MP is giving by default 5 MP image and with two person in it gives 8 MP, but has the same image deterioration on zooming it. What is purpose being 32 MP on when your getting 5 & 8 MP picture.  The Samsung needs to seriously look on such issue of camera image quality. As they push this model based on the 64 MP sony camera with better resolution which was lacking immensely. Even the Amazon technician did not resolved the issue and has to finally return the product.",-0.5448,negative
"  Over all this phone is amazing basically my brother bought this for him but i exchanged it with his old samsung note 8...and i instantly became a huge fan of it...Good things about the phone is you cannot empty the battery even after long hours of gaming(PUBG*before ban*, COD, Modern warfare.etc.) also the finger print reader is way too snappy. I'm a bit of a techie guy and choose phones after reading lot of reviews. This phone is worth all the money you've spent. Plus it looks cool, back cover is necessary its delicate backa nd camera bump. Rest phone is perfect and camera is quite good at this price with some major feature and some useless feature which i dont use at all.I recommend this phone for daily as well as gaming purpose, it serves you well with more then 6 hrs battery remaining once you decide to go sleep after a day usage.

"  Fingerprint sensor:-Fingerprint sensor is good but not so fast. And once in everyday to unlock the mobile, it asks the security password.Battery life:-Battery life is awesome.I saw one or two movies daily.And I use camera for video recording for youtube channel. Sometimes for 2 hours continuously but the battery percentage drop is just 20 to 30%.And I play games in Mx player daily.And I use phone for normal use like calls, internet browsing, reading books, and watching youtube videos.But I used to I charge only once a day even.And for charging it takes nearly 2 hours.Camera quality:-And comes to camera quality I upload some images taken by samsung m31s. You can see it. And for video recording for youtube videos i use open camera app because in camera app given by samsung i didn't find exposure lock. So thats why I use open camera app.And if you want to see the video quality, check this link https://youtu.be/W0encosL-gUAnd while video recording morethan 1.5 to 2 hours. Phone gets heat lightly at the backside. But after stop video recording within few minutes the heat lasts away.Overall performance:-And coming to overall performance, this mobile is good. Good sound, good battery life, good display.Problems that I face:-1. While reading pdf or using samsung notes app and some other apps, I leave the mobile aside, its locked. After when i unlock the mobile, the app didn't interact for my touches like swiping, or tap to write something. At that time when go to recent apps menu and again click on app from the recent app menu. Again the app works.2. Just today, I have a notification from google play about tez shot game. And while I playing that game I face some frame drops but I don't know thats the mobile problem or app problem.3. And comes to sound quality. It was good but almost sound comes in between the volume levels of 4 to 10. When I place at level 4. The sound was too low and cant able to hear.

"  Using  Samsung M31s-6gb 128 gb Mirage  Blue from. Last 15 days, There are 5 things which are pretty Osama:1. Battery life is very good even with heavy Mobile use it goes upto 2 days and take only 1.45 hr to fully charged.2. Mirage Blue color looks great3. Display is Osama s-amoled infinite no comparison with other phones in this range4. Selfi camera is great even you can use it from some distance by just showing your palm towards the camera it captures Selfi so no click needed5.  Quard camera gives a boost with great features like single shot mode for those who are good in clicking pictures and for those who are not good at clicking pictures like me6. I did not find any slowness even when I m playing any games but I am not a hard-core gamer so won't play games like public I am outdoor games lover.Overall a great experience with Samsung M31s. The best part is its a non Chinese product and have better features.",0.9699,positive
  Worst phone ever from day 2 it's been malfunctioning Amazon has the worst return policy they will send the technician and the problem solution he will provide is just factory reset and problem will be solved but the problem will occur again and then the 7 days period is gone and you can not do anything but to go to the samsung service center and stull your problem won't solve there they will update the phone and tell you the problem is solved sir and if will never occur again and then after one day you will face the same problem. This is how the samsung m31s works for me. Highly disappointed in samsung but highly appreciated the Amazon help mr. Ajmal and Vaishali ji they helped  me getting a replacement after 27 days they restore my faith in Amazon and stated that Amazon will not decieve their customer.,-0.42,negative
"  I posted this review after 2 days usages. Actually, I order this phone for my friend. According to him phone is so smooth and also the screen quality is amazing. Yaahh!!! You cannot get this type of amoled screen from any other brand in this prize segment only samsung providing it!! Both Cameras are very good and screen with infinity-O display looks bigger and brighter!!The battery is massive, the charging time with 25Watt charger (including in box) is around 90-100min but battery back you get with normal social media usages and YouTube usages is around 30-36hrs which is incredible!!Note:- this phone comes with Exynos 9611 octacore professor which is quite disappointing. This processor is 1½ years old. Their is no problem with this processor for normal usages but if you r heavy gamer and want to play PUBG, Asphalt like games in high or Ultra-High graphics then this phone might not for you!!So, at last my recommendation is that , if you r a normal user who not played game alot and only usage is social media and multimedia then must go for this phone!!Bcoz you cannot get this type feature from any other smartphone brand and major highlight is that this phone is made in India and samsung is not a Chinese brand also samsung Knox security is very good!! So must buy!!!But if you're heavy gamer then you can ignore this phone, final decision is yours!!👍",0.9507,positive
"  This phone is best non Chinese option under 20k with best battery and Camera performance. If I would rate it under 5 here are my ratings following after usage for 10 days.1. Battery performance - 5/5It would last for nearly 1.5-2 days for normal usage. Very well optimised under One UI 2.1, 6000mah2. Camera performance - 4/5Sony IMX 682 sensor in Samsung really does good job but after image processing it stays on the cooler side. Single shot option is good for fancy photography.3. Side fingerprint - 4.5/5Its faster than In display fingerprints of Samsung A series.4. Speaker performance - 4/5Its not stereo speaker but its very loud and good single speaker.6. Processor - 3/5Exynos 9611 is one generation old and its good for normal users but not as good as Snapdragon 720g or 730g for heavy usages and gaming. And Samsung should improve it as soon as possible because its of one generation back and Chinese company provide Snapdragons in this budget range.Samsung should also provide Corning Gorilla glass 5 and + as other Chinese phones comes with.Knox security is here in this phone but not its full version.And major missing is NFC support which Samsung doesn't provide in M series but it should as phones range is 20k which is higher.",0.9554,positive
"  I bought this phone for below reason1. Samsung brand value2. sAmoled screen, best display, amazin color reproduction, supports Always on Display3. Best in class camera with sony imx 682 sensor, better than many other high range phones as well.4. Single take camera feature works superb5. Amazing low light photography6. 25W superfast samsung charger in this price range and monster battery 6000 mah which easily works of minimum 1.5 to 2 days7. Knox security8. Cool body finishing9. Side mounted finger print sensor, better than back and indisplay finger print sensor10. Small punch hole display in front for camera which makes screen even better. Thats great as compared to pill shaped 2 camera or U camera.11. Sapphire camera glass. Checked this in one of the m31s durability test. It does not get scratched even with level 7 scratches.12. We can use this phone as power bank( phone to phone charging)13. Dolby audio in headphonesand bluetooth speaker14. Loud loudspeake15.hyperlapse,slow motion,super slow motion video can be taken16.u can switch from back camera to front camera while recordingThis is best phone under 21k range and also easily beats many phones under 30k as well.",0.9897,positive
"  From my personal view, this is the best phone under 20000. Ya, like every phone this phone also have some pros and cons.Pros:1. Amazing display. I Just felt in love with this display.2. Amazing battery life. I am a heavy user and in one cycle of charge, my whole day is easily covered. And charging speed is also high. No heating issue during charging.3. Amazing camera quality. Both front and back are awesome.4. Awesome design. When u will take it in hand it's feels like premium phones. Back panel is plastic but trust me u will not feel it. It's feels like glass.And that Punch hole is like extra cashew in your milkshake.5. One UI is very smooth and easy to use. Dark mode and always on display are one ofmy favorite feature.6. U can control ur notification panel with ur fingerprint sensor. This is my favorite feature of one UI. It's very helpfull. No device will give u this feature.7. No heating issue.8. Knox security is there.Cons:1. Processor is exynos 9611, but if u r not a gamer, then this phone is best for u in this price range.2. Fingerprint positioning should be in display. It's not justifying with amaloed display.3. No secure folder.Conclusion: If u r not a heavy gamer, then this phone is best for you under 20000.",0.9934,positive

"  Pros:+ The display is the standout feature here, just brilliant.+ Battery life is very good & fulfills its promise, lasting more than a day & a half.+ Nice sound too from a single speaker, it can get rather loud.Middling/undecided:= Camera seems good enough but I haven't tested it much beyond some nice indoor selfies in artificial light.= Responsive enough for daily use by a senior person, not intending to use this for heavy gaming at all.= The 128GB storage & Dedicated SD card support is good enough at the Rs.19.5k price range (as of September 2020) & should keep things comfortable without needing to continuously make space available for the long run.Cons:- Samsung's software, had to tinker around & change or remove some apps like Phone to Google defaults because the alternatives weren't as customizable or familiar. Tries to install a lot of bloat during setup. If you like Samsung's ecosystem features then this shouldn't stop you.- The fingerprint sensor isn't as sharp as it could have been & is hit & miss. Being on the edge gives it a learning curve as your finger needs to be positioned correctly to cover the sensor.",0.9901,positive
  Worth for money but except few things...1) battery runs too fast for 1hr continuous use it runs about 15-20%2) camera clarity is not upto 64mp as 25mp can easily beat the clarity of this mobile3) finger print sensor doesn't match all time4) face recognition is only applicable in very bright area5) internet connectivity is too slowAs a reviewer A series is better than M series as there is difference of sky and earth between A and M series.As I use both  A and M series I got the difference between them.Except this it's the best,0.979,positive

First time I have been informed about display problem but couldn't be resolved. Further I came to know from service center about its mother board problem. Still awaiting for its repair.

So I request samsung to please take a look on this because it is would be a better for Samsung brand to make a better profit and sales.

  It's a review after two weeks of usage. Battery life is damn good. Even after my hectic day when my old phone needed a charge this shows 50% remaining. Camera is super awesome. 64 MP  camera is true to its name. Single mode is another feather in the cap. The display is awesome and can be read in bright daylight with auto adjustable brightness. It has Knox security and samsung Max which is a VPN to protect your phone from hackers and anything wrong through the internet. The phone is zippy fast. The front camera is also capable of 4k recording . The side key touch is a bit nagging thing though because the way I hold it. The notification alsways comes up as with the slide on the lock button the notification panel opens up. Ignoring this minor glitch the phone is highly recommended for the price range it is available at and biggest of all is it is MADE IN INDIA.,0.9674,positive
"  The Samsung Galaxy M31 managed to make a good impact in the budget segment thanks to its crisp AMOLED display and a big battery, which helped distinguish it from the competition. Samsung has now launched its successor, called the Galaxy M31s. The new Galaxy M31s sports an Infinity-O display and the Single Take camera feature, both firsts for the Galaxy M series. Starting at Rs. 19,499, do these new features justify the higher price? I review the Galaxy M31s to find out.spent the last five days with the Galaxy M31s, and here is my take on the phone.Samsung Galaxy M31s specifications: 6.5-inch FHD+ Super AMOLED display| Samsung Exynos 9611|6GB RAM/8GB RAM, 128GB storage, microSD support included|6000mAh battery, 25W fast charging support|32MP front camera, 64MP main camera+12MP ultra wide camera+5MP depth camera+5MP macro camera||Android 10, OneUIThe Galaxy M31s reminds me of the Galaxy A51 in terms of design language. The front of the phone has an edge-to-edge 6.5-inch AMOLED display and a small hole for the front-facing camera. Flip the phone, and you will notice the rectangular camera bump on the top left – the setup is similar to that of the Galaxy S20 series. On the left side there’s the SIM tray, while on the right, there’s a power button that doubles as a fingerprint scanner and volume rocker. On the bottom, there’s a USB-C port, a speaker and a headphone jack.I buyed for youtube channel review but it's a average good performance  experience give to me",0.9032,positive
"  First usage reviews....Awesome power packed phone.Pros1. The usp of the phone is the finger print reader. Perhaps, I say it is more convenient and faster then face unlock.2. The display is excellent. You really enjoy watching videos on it.3. Battery backup is good and fast charge is brilliant.4. The OS works smoothly.Cons1. Weighs a little more.2. Samsung has given a mono speaker, which I think at this price is not fair. Stereo speakers were expected.Detailed review will be posted after few days of usage.",0.8454,positive

  Battery drainage issue is there in ideal condition in 1 hour battery drainage is about 5 to 6%. Processor is not heating but lags most of the time .This was the first and last time I brought samsung device. I brought only because of non-chinese device and I believe that they fooled Indian so good. Go for Nokia or any other brand non-chinese  device but believe me. Don't waste money in this crisis time. The internet speed is really slow as it does not support 4g+ it only support 4g volte which is also minus point. All in all totally unsatisfied with the device .

"  At the beginning i felt the battery is weak which was getting emptied at the soonest time. Later i found the inner settings of the mobile and it is running good and for me 100% charge is getting consumed for around 25-30 hours. Camera quality is really awesome and have wonderful clarity with high pixels for both rear and selfie cameras. In-built features also good when compared to other similar ranged smartphones. As per my experience and requirement, 6 GB is more than enough. So suggest to purchase 6GB rather than investing extra 2k just for 2GB more. The main reason for me to buy this is not manufactured in China and i was supposed to change the bloody China phone Redmi. But the only fault i found is network issues. Even after checked with service center guys, i am getting network issues. Even though there will be 75% coverage of network, internet doesnt work properly. Checked area network capacity tbru telecom company and it was good.Overall this phone is worthy for the 20k compared to other brands for the price. You can purchase this confidentally if you are looking for a good smartphone with best camera and battery smartphone in 20-22 k.",0.9477,positive

"  Using for 3 months now. Keeping everything short:-Performance: it's a smooth experience! Though I don't play games.Camera: I am in love with it.Though,The macro camera is of no use.The single take feature is of no use for meBut the HDR and AI are well optimised in this device.Vid quality is decent.Has electronic image stabilization.Display: I would have given 10 stars out of 5 if it was possible. Brilliant display with great quality! Even in direct sunlight.Supports always on display.The hole punch is quite small. And after few days it's nearly unnoticeable.Battery: if you are buying it because of 6000 mah battery, you might not be pleased.I am just getting a day out of it!Charging: just after 3 months it's taking 2.5 hrs (approx) to charge fully.I am disappointed with the charger.22 W charger is just a mental peace thing!Design: looks beautiful in hand. But a fingerprint magnet. And please use case. My one got a scratch from my finger ring.Touch screen: works even with wet fingers.Fingerprint: wet hands will not work.Even with light sweat, the fingerprint stops working.UI: I felt the UI is lot better than redmi and realmi.Add free and smooth experience.Special: it has a grip sensor which detects how you are holding the phone and adjusts it's antennas according to get the best signal.If you have this device you can check your grip sensor.Dial *#0*# and then select grip sensor.It's amazing!Conclusion:If you want brilliant camera and the best display in this price range, go for it.You will love it.But if you just want battery, I will suggest not to go with this device.",0.9941,positive
"  Samsung has released M31s with updated design. Here are the pros and cons after a week of using the phone.Pro:1) The display is best in class and comparable to premium smartphones. If you use the phone in dark mode, you will love the deep black and vivid colours. It's definitely a treat to the eyes. I personally prefer AMOLEDs to high refresh LCDs. Hence Samsung has done a wonderful job here.2) The fingerprint reader is mounted on to power button. Its reachable to the thumb and extremely fast. The buttons are tactile and provide good feedback.3) I get close to two days of battery life with regular use. My usages include social media, YouTube and calls. I use two SIMs with internet always active. Even with continuous usage, it will last more than 9 hours.4) Camera quality is good during day light. Both from Regular and Ultra wide angle camera. During night, the regular camera did decent job. Photos are attached for the same. The selfie is awesome in this phone.5) I was sceptical about the performance considering the processor. But I couldn't find any lag or heating in my day to day use. I am not an avid gamer, hence I can't vouch for this processor to gamers.6) The weight distribution has been good and you won't find the phone to be bulky. It's usable by one hand too.7) Single take, reverse charging, fast charging, triple slot are all the extra features which makes the phone good.Con:The price. Even though I have no complaints about the processor for my day to day use, as they have increased the price of the phone by around 2.5k in comparison to M31 they could have gone for a more powerful processor.Conclusion:If you are a casual user who wants phone for media consumption (Good display+Battery) and don't mind the 19.5k price, you can wholeheartedly go for this. You won't regret.",0.9912,positive
"  Well, I am not much of big user of phones for Games / Photos.I basically wanted to avoid Chinese phone (for reasons best known to all) and actually my earlier phone display got damaged during lockdown time (due to sanitizing).This phone as such when used for last one week, I was initially concerned on battery life as per few of earlier reviews. but to my surprise it give me proper timeline of 2 days with almost 10-12 hrs of mobile hotspot usage for my office work & calls (both audio & video). It still has some 10% battery left after almost 40 hrs of last charging. Also as mentioned it gets almost charged within 2 hrs.Rest honestly have not much tried taking any of monster shots / camera usage hence wont able to comment on that. But yes rest all usage was nice upto expectations. Finger sensor had been really good with my first thumb sensor but other hand finger sensor is not working that properly, may be i will activate it again.Yes, some of samsung pre-installed apps is bit of headache to get rid off it not used.One more thing, if as everyone says yes bit disappointed as there has been no backcover given.Samsung how much it would have taken to give one proper backcover and one earphones too. (is that too much to ask for - no earphones !! really surprised )Finally, yes it's slightly overpriced.. anything around 18K would have been better but 22k is bit 4k on higher side (would not have still not been minding it if proper backcover and earphones if had been given).Overall for me it's a good phone as for now.... hope to review further after an month usage.",0.9891,positive
  I have used this for 5 days and i these are my observations -1. If you are willing to play heavy games then go with Snapdragon smartphones.2. If you are a business user or using it with normal apps then this is a great option for you.3. The OneUI is very good i can say because it has lot of customisation and very decent to look at.4. Transparent cover is not included so you have to go for other brand cases.5. Phone is handy as it's not that big in size.6. Type C fast charger is there with two sided type C which will help you with reverse charging and can use with laptop having type c port.,0.908,positive
"  if you are looking for a Smartphone in a medium price range. Then this is the best deal. Samsung has created a very beautiful phone. It's got everything. Got my phone on Saturday, since then I just can't stop using it.It's camera is very clear and takes sharp pictures. Now me being a person who loves taking pictures,I enjoyed capturing beautiful mesmerizing shots with the camera. 64mp gives pictures a clarity like dslr. Ultra wide shot of 12 mp captures every detail and is perfect for capturing a wide shot.The best point about this phone I only had to charge it in the morning,and then I use it for the entire day- taking pictures,capturing moments, playing games like call of duty and while doing all this, I use my Boat Bluetooth Headsets connected with my handset.The battery of this phone is amazing. It really lasts long.The touch and feel of this phone is very premium like Samsung note 10 or iPhone 11.And I really like the color Mirage Blue- it's the mixture of silver and blue.Just one downtown which I found that Samsung hasn't provided any headphones with the handset.Samsung people you should add headphones as well as a good cover for the phone would also be appreciated.All in all I really am enjoying my new phone and exploring it. Just in love with it's camera. It's so amazing.One more thing with this camera you don't need any other camera apps. Samsung has included everything in the camera.",0.9963,positive

Didn't expected this from Samsung.The phone also comes with lot of bloatware softwares, these get install automatically at the time of setup.

"  Amazing processing speed, camera quality is too good. With its clear display and sleek design, it becomes an absolute sassy buy! The color combination used at the back of this phone is perfectly balanced to give it a look, a class apart. A must buy phone in this range.Ordered my phone on 6th August, got it well before the supposed time and in a good packaging. Good work amazon team on the delivery side.Potential buyers, go for this phone without any second opinion!! You won't regret it.",0.9759,positive
  I have been using the Samsung M31s for a week now. The phone is worth the money you pay. The display is phenomenal. Storage and RAM is good. Camera is decent. Only thing that you will not like is processor if you play games. Or else you will really love this phone. Its not too heavy east yo hold even with case. Battery will last around 1.5 days. This phone can be used as a powerbank also. Speaker sound quality is decent. Fingerprint reader is fast and placed well (Atleast for me).When I unboxed the phone I found that the travel adapter had big scratches and looked like used one. And the Type C cable also had a slight damage. Apart from that Phone was well packed.,0.8996,positive
"   Superb camera and battery life with 25 watt super fast charger.Disappointed with processor  which can be better to replace with Qualcomm snapdragon 765.Body of handset is well designed with color in curved shape.All over awasome experience, after 10 years I choose samsung after improvement.Hope samsung will continues move ahead for next generation demand.",0.91,positive
"  I m not that satisfied with camera quality as much I was expecting looking at the description of the product. Especially for night mode. Battery life is also running like 4500-5000mh battery. Well there is no lag or performance issues I have noticed so far. I was expecting more features in camera to get better quality image as compared to redmi phones. If you are looking for Samsung or okay to compromise bit with camera quality then go for it. In the end, camera is not too bad, only it is not up to expectations of the advertisement.",0.8736,positive
"  Overall phone is good.Pros: New features and gestures added to the phone are very good.Cons:1. The processor could have been better.2. The main rear camera is a little disappointing. I tried comparing camera with old mi A3 and OnePlus 5t, I get superior photo quality in these 2 older phones and even in old mi A3 budget smartphone. The photos in Samsung m31s captured by rear camera are more whitish and not clear and detailed.Maybe Samsung could fix these camera problems with a new software update. But below 20k mid-range smartphones, the expectations are higher than budget smartphones. And these problems should overcome.",-0.6903,negative
  After mob dispatch i was so happy to get it but after configuration i suffer with mob overheating.

"  I bought samsung M31s for my wife..used for two weeks. C is using mobile for story reading and ludo king only. Earlier c used Redmi note 7 pro.1. Camera: 64MP camera is not like 64MP. It's Sony camera. But redmi note 7 pro camera is better. Front camera is good. Then video quality is good.2. Battery: 6000mah!  It's doubt.. it sucks charge very fast. Within 24 hours more than 90% charge is dried. Charging time also around 2 hours it takes. Redmi note 7 pro is better than this.3. Connectivity: it is very poor. While sending text through what's app, After 30 second only it sends text. C s using Jio sim. No signal issues also. Downloading also very slow. ( I am using moto G5 s plus, it performs better than M31s. I am also using Jio sim.)4. Performance: There is lag in performance of mobile.. it's being very slow. It uses extra storage of 6 GB RAM. Already installed apps occupies 2.5 GB. If we install other app means it occupies 4GB out of 6GB.Redmi note 7 pro performed well than this.5. Display : Very good display. No cons about display.. it has good display..6. Finger print: side finger print option is good.  But it is used only for display on, it does not switch of the display. If we put flip cover, we couldn't register thumb impression on finger print scanner.",0.8622,positive
"  The phone is really good. But that doesn't mean it doesn't have its fair share of issues. The major issue i face is with the software. Rest everything works fine. Samsung keeps releasing new bugs in each of their updates. Major software issued I faced are unstable network, app freeze and  data speed issues. Sometimes even if I'm sitting right next to the wifi it shows 1 bar less. And the speed drops considerably. Speed tests indicate really fast speeds but while using the apps it doesn't work at an efficient speed. Especially apps such as YouTube,  whatsapp etc. This im guessing is a software issue. The app freeze is also a software issue.",0.6911,positive
"  While writing this reviews I have already used this mobile more than 20 days .Phone is excellent specially ONEUI 2.1 is fabulous,No ads and no bloatwares.But the processor is little bit old processor, otherwise everything is fine .Go for it without any second thought .One more major point ..Now privacy is one of the biggest fundamental human rights ,which you can't get in Chinese smartphones.They are stealing our data .So nowadays for privacy you have to worry bcoz in smartphone you are carrying a lots of information regarding card information,your heartbit after a run ,your photos ,images ,banking information etc etc..",-0.5106,negative

"  Good mobile. Btw all samsung mobiles are same, no difference at all .its the same what I was expecting. I just wanted new mobile as my old phone was 1 year old , so i purchased this on exchange offer.  Dont expect much from any mobile phone.. phone is for calling, messaging and for little time paas when we r alone and not at home. At home I have PC , TV etc that i use for gaming or watching movies.. I use mobile for its main purpose only, so I am not disappointed but price is little bit higher. And same old design. Poor samsung cant make better looking mobiles. Always they make cheap plastic body. And then claminng 64 mp camera, 6 gb ram and bla bla. For taking pictures i use my nikon camera. . I just want phone simple good looking and only for normal use. They cant make 2 stereo loud speaker phone? Then cant make its look better? But they r focused on 256mp camera.

Finger print: quickly responds.6. Charger: Complete charge in around 1 1/2hr from zero percent.7. Speaker: Nice and loud. clear music.Cons:1. My eyes gets red after usage and getting little headache, not sure if due to mobile vivid display. because when i changed this to natural i am not facing such issue.Overall: Happy with the product.",0.9704,positive
  Too much of shutter lag in camera. Few lags seen in few application as well. All other things are great. At this price point a good device. They could have given a more Snapdragon chipset.Update: While playing audio with Android auto there is audio drop(kind of skip). Not sure is this is problem with Android auto or phone Bluetooth while playing music. Was using apple before and music was smooth.,0.4833,positive
"  M31s is an expectation met smartphone. If I define in one word it is ""Superfluous midranger with High speed performance"". Used Samsung, Micromax, vivo phones. But the Camera I have never seen this depth, clarity and saturated color photos in any product so far. SPEAKER has a bass touch in it equaling a Stereo speaker. Its Knox protected mobile. Built quality is super premium. Mirage Blue is defines a Class Flagship premium look. Thanks for the rapid Delivery and Amazon packing was secure. A well justified price for the M31s. So what are you waiting for, order it & u will love M31s liquid LPDDR4x RAM speed & a massive 6000mAh with a INTELLI CAMERA, Samsung has really improved the camera segment in M31s. ",0.9912,positive
"  Best budget phone.1. Exynos haters, try to keep your data safe with SD processors. Also big brands like Samsung work on optimization which chinese brands can never. So performance is smooth.2.

  First of all Delivery from Amazon was pathetic. It was delivered with water on packaging n bit on phone too. When I called customer care they said can't replace it However they will pay back the amount where I have spent time n money n bought it with some coupon.Coming to phone performance its ok and can't say best.  One good thing is its very good camera featured phone with multiple n good option.,0.7667,positive

The phone has a great primary camera, fantastic battery life, a crisp and vivid display, capable performance, and good build quality. The dedicated microSD card slot and 3.5mm headphone jack only add to the smartphone's appeal.The macro lens and ultra-wide camera are also quite average.

There are lot of customisation option unlike Chinese phones (I don't like those push and force advertisement in MI and other Chinese phones).

"  I extensively researched for a month before purchasing this mobile. I run a company and I was looking for a mobile which can be with me without any maintenance and slowing down for at least 3 years. I cannot afford to change mobile phones every year and I'm already using an iPhone 6s Plus.I was confused with this mobile, Oneplus Nord and realme 6 pro and finally purchased this mobile.Pros:1) The screen quality is Awesome. it is super AMOLED and no less than the flagship series of Samsung.2) The battery life is the second-best point of this phone. The battery lasts at least 1.5 days even with heavy usage.3) Samsun One UI is also great. There are no ads, unlike MI, Oppo and Vivo phones. It offers a lot of customizations and one the easiest to use.4) The camera is not that bad, the camera is not that good as OnePlus Nord but it is not that bad. It has an average camera.5) No Heating issues.6) It can run games easily. I won't say it is the best at handling games but if you are not a gamer, you can run any game on this mobile easily.7) The speaker is big enough.8) Audio quality is simply unmatched, it has Dolby Atmos and with earphones it is awesome.Cons:1)The biggest Con that no will tell you is - it has no Haptik feedback and also Vibration sucks.2) Fingerprint reader and face unlock is not worth it. It is really bad.2) Plastic back is very bad and you need to cover it to save it from damages.3) No earphones, Screen guard and the back cover comes with the phone. Please get the cover on the same day as there can be micro scratches on the phone.4)The phone is heavy and a bit thick.",0.8392,positive
"  A pretty decent mobile on its performance,maynot be a choice for gamers but for normal use this works perfectly well.Camera with outdoor lighting is brilliant with natural color production and you can make wonders using PRO mode,need improvements in artificial lightings. Video stabalization is not that great as even minor shake cause a blurry output.Bixby vision and AR zone are too cool.Super Amoled display is a treat to watch,call quality is good,excellent battery,smart view option to mirror mobile screen is good. To conclude, M31s definately stands tall from samsung segment but if it would have been within 17k price range it would surely be one of the competative one in market.",0.9798,positive
"  You won't get such an awesome phone at this price. I pray the company not to withdraw or increase price of  this phone from the market as this more than worth a flagship phonePROSSee the quality of the image of the food that's captured using M31s. There is nothing more to explain about its camera quality than this.The keyboard has built in audio to type the messages according to our voice. And this works in all apps.As far finger print is concerned its very fast. I had been using vivo z1x, IPhone 11, OPPO, etc. But the finger print speed is lightening.Also face unlock. In this phone it has an extra feature to add alternate face. Its similar to adding 2 faces or with mask or make up and without the same. Also it has an option for open eye to unlock.Among this range phones of Samsung,  it has always on display, which was lacking in samsung mid range bands. I like it too much.The look of the phone is quite like a flagship phone. We feel the built is with metal or glass and it is fantastic.The super amoled display is like liquid display. Finger flows freely.About the speaker, even the ring tone itself has a rich tone. We long for hearing music again and again.The full screen view of videos is awesome. We not even notice the camera hole in it.CONSonly three fingers can be added. If there is an option to add attract 10 fingers,  it would be even better.",0.9917,positive
"  See in this price one cannot get everything right, so Samsung has offering for best camera, display, and battery in this price.I must say camera is one factor which is hard to master in low price, even one plus struggle to give best cam in 30k.So camera is top highlight, then the quality of display it has. Is surely amazing to this price.The ui experience is surely amazing, if you have never used one ui then it's hard for you to understand but this is best ui, with high level in customisation and top level security.Performance is also good if not awesome.

Camera is also good (especially the features like pro,  slow motion and time laps ). but sometimes I felt camera application is slow. Phone is good enough for daily usage when battery is less. I'm using more than 55 applications other than the preinstalled applications haven't noticed any difficulties in multi tasking. I have played PUBG too, but it was not that great experience because of heating issue after continuous usage.The side mount fingerprint scanner is a excellent feature especially easy when using bigger phones.

"  NOT A TECHNICAL BUT AN HONEST USER EXPERIENCE AS YOU HAVE TO TAKE A BOW ITS LONG LASTING BATTERY LIFE, BEST PERFORMANCE & VIVID CAMERA QUALITY RESULTSBATTERY LIFE:The previous generation samsung phone had only 1 problem i.e., of battery. This has now completely resolved. I use my personal phone same as I use my laptop. Every transaction, business work, personal stuffs name it. Still, due to heavy usage of phone, battery lasted for as much as 48 hours!!!! Can't get any better deal than this at this price.CAMERA:With a quad camera setup of 64 MP, you can snap some of the great memories with your phone. I am more into scanning the documents from a phone than taking snaps of nature and this phone has not discouraged me any way.PROCESSOR:Heavy usage of phone has not discouraged me either in processor. I am not a techno savvy guy still I can write that this phone has got nuts in performing multi-tasking.BUILD QUALITY:Corning gorilla glass and sturdy body frame of phone has not upset me either. Yes phone was drop by me mistakenly on day 1 still no crack or break.What else do you need in a 20-22k price range? Samsung Galaxy M31s is a complete all in one package!!!",0.9638,positive

"  Let's start with pros:Battery - My battery runs for around 48 hours with normal call flow & messages/ WhatsApp, around 1 hour of gaming, 1 hour of Amazon Prime, etc.Camera - Camera output is awesome. Single take feature is superb. It shares 1 best shot, 1 small video, 1 super fast video and 1 reverse video. Front camera is equally good.RAM & ROM - I'm using 8GB & 128GB phone & its performance is up to mark.Sound - Sound is not very extra ordinary for music lovers but when you use speaker for normal calls - it works fine. This phone also has FM radio which most of the companies are not offering now a days.The best feature is placement of finger print sensor. It's at the side of handset - right under the volume control. The placement of this sensor make its use quite handy.Let's go for cons:The only con I could find out is non-availability of a good back/ flip cover. In my view Samsung should start manufacturing the cover along with the handset and bundle it with handset for ease of it's customers.",0.9806,positive
"  This is one of the best Android phones under budget.Camera quality with 64 megapixel covers wide angle photographs with really good quality. Also capability of recording 4k videos with no delays adds to the fun of making awesome videos.It has fingerprint reader and face recognition to unlock. Fingerprint gets dusty sometimes with usage, but works pretty well.The battery life is amazing. Full charge easily carries the normal phone usage to 30 hours.Overall its a very good phone under 20000.",0.9769,positive
  It is a phone which is jack of all trades master of none.Battery is goodCharging speed is goodHardware performs well for day to day tasks.Camera ain't that good.No heating issues.Just phone takes time to boot up.Net speed is slow when the phones restarts after switching off.So give two minutes after switching on and then try internet .,0.2732,positive
"  Pros -1.Display is awesome one would love this.2. Camera quality is very good.3. Side Fingerprint scanner work very well but it takes 2-3 days to get used to that.4. Have some super cool features such as Blue Light Filter, Music share (Can be used only other phone has similar feature)Cons -1.Processor is very slow. Even one plus 3, 4 years old phone processor was super fast as compared to this one. Probably Ram management is not that good in this phone.2. You cannot remove some preloaded apps in this one even if you want to.3. A bit bulky and thick and after adding cover you may find it as ok ok phone.4. Had to add Nova launcher for customisation. One UI v 2.1 is not that cool if you have gone through using one plus Oxygen or Motorola stock android. One cannot change the opening of apps page from Horizontal to Vertical. Finding the app becomes a bit issues.5. Selfie images are not real and seems one has done some makeup to make them better.",0.9811,positive
  *Detailed Review *Ohkay so in am gonna start with saying in regards with people who want to buy this phone for gaming purpose.So i would recommend  that please look another phone for that because  exynoss is not made for you .Then i am gonna talk about camera.As per a phone worth 20k camera is not worth it in terms of low light images.Talking about Security so i havent received any knox along with it not sure how other people said that they got one. But this phone do have a huge amount of unwanted applications  and UI is not as great as expected  but decent.I am huge huge disappointed with battery life because its draining really fast.Like when i started writing this with usual speed i have seen 2 percent reduction in battery  and my phone doesnt even have many apps its just whatsap and insta nothing much. Still not sure why is it draining.So maybe a scam with 6000 mah branding.Design is decent but indisplay finger print scanner would be appreciated.Because side mounted is slow and dont even talk about  the face unlock.Display is massive and amazing. Sharp colors and pretty amazing display but not sure if i drop it someday then whts gonna happen because its just corning gorilla glass 3.Looks like Samsung is living in 2015.No headphones  no tempered no protection .This is wierd. I mean  customers can atleast expect something out of box insted of charger and sim ejecter tool. Like common. Atlest give us temprory sim protection  .Because it can get scratched so easily .Please Samsung think about customer a bit....Final verdict.Phone is good enough for people like me who are just gonna use social media and netflix on phone and a decent camera use.Please dont expected something else from this.,0.9751,positive
  Battery seems to be draining too fast.Not at all 6000mah feature.Camera is okOverall not very satisfied from samsung.Expectations were very high from brand Samsung.,-0.3713,negative
"  * Display (4.5/5) : Super AmOLED. Rating : 4.5/5 for not having higher refresh rate.* Battery and charging (5/5) : 6000mah massive battery charges at 25w in-box charger, takes around 80-90 minutes for 0-100% at phone switched off. Provides around 8 hrs of SoT.* Processors (3.5/5): Exynos 9611 (10nm, 8 cores, 4 at 2.3 GHz, 4 at 1.7 GHz). Not suitable for heavy gaming. Good for average user.Built (3/5): Plastic frame, plastic back, Corning Gorilla Glass 3 at front. Back is glossy, feels oily, and fingerprint magnet and gets scratched easily with coins, key chains in pocket. Samsung should provide backcover in box.Camera (4/5) : Sony's IMX682 noticed to be improved that from M31's Samsung sensor. Lacks details at low light and cropping.Overall good phone at this budget.",0.9001,positive
"  I received my Samsung Galaxy M31s (Mirage Black / 8GB / 128 GB) on 18-Aug-20 and writing this review after 1 month of usage.Pros:1. Look wise and colour excellent 5/52. Camera 4/53. Speaker and Sound 5/54. Battery 5/55. Performance 4/5. A common man can not trace out any negative point easily as this phone fulfils all his/her need that is needed by 80-90% of people. Remaining 10-20% would fall under techie category and they would not be satisfied by having sky in their hands too.6. OS Experience 5/5Cons:1. Little bit bulky compare to other phones. But, if your look at other pros then this tiny issue gets nullify.Verdict : Overall phone is very good and value for money. Whatever we paid we got it. No regret at all. Guys if you are a Samsung fan and want to go with 20K budget around, then trust me you would not be disappointed. So, no more thinking and worry ness anymore. Go for it, order and grab it😊",0.9776,positive

"  This is the first phone I've bought online and I am extremely happy with the service by Amazon and Samsung.BEST THINGS ABOUT THIS PHONE:> At this price range, the features that Samsung Galaxy M31s offers are top-notch.> The camera quality is quite awesome.> The battery is getting fully charged after 40-45 mins of charging.> The feel of this phone is pretty good too. It is sleek, lightweight and easy to carry.This is the best phone in this price range and I would surely recommend it.",0.979,positive
  For smart phones in the 10 to 12k categories there is notification light...which is missing in this 20k phone...The unlock with finger on the side near the vol up and down key is a total mess...90 percent of the time it doesn't read...Even the screen touch sometimes drags i.e. it stops or doesn't capture the movement..this is a big glitch.So ...If anyone is looking for a smart phone this one is definitely not value for money...except ram and memory.,0.3744,positive
  Good quality product from Samsung camera is good  after usage it is working fine for multiple apps and gaming is decent I loved the figure print scanner and face unlock facility as it is quick as compared to 6000 mah  battery it drains faster as my expecting a more time can use normal battery for 2 days but if your using videos and gaming then don't expect  that overall a good productBetter to stand by against Chinese products,0.8625,positive

If content viewing is your priority ,then go for it!Battery life is awesome!Camera performance is top notch! Both front and rear cameras are brilliant. Single take feature is very helpful.Side fingerprint sensor is very practical.Processor is the only -ve aspect of this phone. Snapdragon processor would have been a killer ,but for day to day activities the Exynos 9611 is good and capable enough. U might see some lag in heavy games thats y this phone is not for gamers at all.Overall a brilliant all round phone from Samsung!",0.9563,positive
"  Honest review for a Honest Samsung phone. I am writing this review after using it for a week And my verdict based on truly improved Samsung M series with my experience & tested after usage only.BUILD QUALITY.Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. My hand is small but still I found 6.5 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT.With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M31s feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.BATTERY.Main benefit of this midrange M series is it's maasive 6000mAh battery which gave me enough juice for nearly 3 days continuously. Tested.CAMERA.This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 mwgapixel with Single Take feature. Samsung gives what it advertises. Which made me to stick to Samsung brand. My usage of Camera is high & I found no complaints at all in focusing a shoot. Good color saturated. Well bright night shots. Macro shots r OSM. The depth & clarity of 64 megapixel is more developed in this M31s model. So no complaints.PROCESSOR.After using for more than half month I must say, Exynos 9611 works wonderful liquid speed when it is combined with LPDDR4X RAM technology. I have not faced any lag in PUBG or ASPHALT-9 hight end games, in medium setting which is good for battery saving. So 2.3Ghz speed accomplished. No complaints for the budget spent.SOUND QUALITY.After using for hours I found the Speaker this time Samsung made is much improved with Bass Stereo which was missing earlier. The in-ear delivers your ear the pure Dolby Atmos with clear precision and crystal clear bass effect.Fingerprint Sensor:Having integrated fingerprint sensor with power button it feels awesome and works always!!Bang for the bucks go for it. Thanks Amazon for Safe delivery.",0.9989,positive
"  This phone gives a very premium feel while holding. Fingerprint reader is quick which was expected at this price point. I use this phone whole day and still can't drain the battery before sleeping, camera quality is simply awesome 😎, i didn't think it's camera will work this good in indoor lighting conditions and as you can see dynamic range is also very good, i should have taken more outdoor photos to show you the dynamic range but i don't go out much😐, but if you are making long videos phone might heatup a little if you are using any kind of cover, but don't worry, it will cool down if you put it on rest for minute or two.Phone is little on heavier side but considering massive battery it's negligible, you can get used to it😁. This phone suits my needs so, i am giving it five stars🤩.",0.9705,positive
"  I have used this Mega Monstar for over a month now and if you are confused and reading this comment you will get all your answers, answered.Camera Performance:I will not get into the number but this phone camera is best in 20,000 price bracket in comparison to any other phone in this competitions. The HDR, Dynamic Range all things are captured very good. Sometimes struggle in low night but will do the job other wise.Performance:Exynos 9611 before the launch i hoped Samsung would have upgraded this processor beacuse we have seen this processor in other phones as well but they didn't.But now after using it i don't have any problem with it's performance. I only notice a lag in switching from camera to any other app and will tell you that this processor is good enough for a medium user but if you play games for more than 2hrs. you will see a few lags and then phone performance declines and other than that performance is good.Battery life:(I should tell you that charge this phone at night and then use it for the rest of the day worry free!)This phones gives me screen on time over 11hrs. a day and i use my phone for entertainment purposes like Netflix, YouTube, Prime Video's, Hotstar etc. And it's great at night i usually go to bed with 20-30% battery left.Display:I would have said the best display in 20,000 but now Realme 7 Pro also have Samoled display and Finger Frint sensor in the display which look's cool but is not as fast a Samsung Galaxy M31s. So for display there you have one phone competing with it.Phone does have HDR10 as i haved checked it.If you love to watch your content on you phone M31s should be your pick.Knox Security/Security:Phone does show Knox Security but you will not get all the features of Knox in it there are one or two features that you can use of Knox Security otherwise other features are not visible to you but knox make phone secure very much in comparison to other Chinese phones.Design:I have Mirage Black colour and phone looks very cool. Handling is also good. And other than any other M series phone this phone have a frame ( Plastic one) and glastic back basically a polycarbonate back.Final verdict:I will definitely recommend you this phone for it's Camera, Display, Battery and overall user experience. Once you start using Samsung phones and there OneUi there's no going back for sure.",0.9967,positive
"  Battery life is average as it has 6000 mah but not worth it because i have already use 5000 mah max pro m2 from Asus .Battery optimisation require.Camera quality is best but it has complicated software experience.Fingerprint reader position should be under the display but side finger is also good but lack of authentication sometime.I don't want to talk about the exynos 9611 because it is a old chipset from 2018 ,processd sometimes laggy .Phone has everything all we need, but need proper update to control all the process.Showing knox security in start but there is no secure folder.Overall I can say it is a worthy smartphone to buy................4/5 ratings as per my opinion.",0.9345,positive
"  I am writing this review after use of 10 days. Finger print reader response is very quick and operating is hassle free as it is fixed with power/lock key. Battery life is much better but phone consumes battery too much and hence u can expect a power of maximum for 2 days even though it has monster battery of 6000 Mah. Camera quality is just best, may it be rear camera or front one. You won't be disappointed. Its touch is smooth and having quick response. Overall the phone in this range is best but not for heavy gamers.",0.964,positive

"  After 10 days of use I find no fault in this phone. Camera is of top class, battery lasts almost for 2 days in one full charge; it doesn't take  too long to get fully charged. It gives good feeling in hand. Initially I was hesitating to buy it after going through a few negative reviews. But I didn't  want to buy a Chinese phone so I  went for it. My advice, go for it if you want to spend Rs. 19,000. Although I bought it for Rs 17900 under a sale on Amazon.",0.4403,positive

Its my first time i am using samsung and i have no regrets. Its classy phone. Yes little heavier side but you get awesome battery backup and feels like you actually holding something. You will need to buy cover for it as it can easily get scratches at the back panel.",0.9916,positive
"  A huge upgrade for me, especially when you are replacing old Chinese Redmi 4. The quality of the display is just awesome.  And so is the overall build quality. And you get super fast charger bundled with it. The wide angle camera is also good. The only con which I noticed is that there is no back cover bundled with this package. And since it is a newly launched product, there are not much options available as of now as far as the back cover and tempered glass is concerned. The back of the phone is a fingerprint magnet.The phone delivers an everlasting experience. And I love the dedicated memory card slot.",0.9623,positive

  I had searched budgetd phone (20-30 k ) for around 2 months and then decided to go with this...decisions was influenced with Indian - China movement too and canceled Nord and ordered this.I am working professional and Mideocare gamer too..1. Screen or Display - 4/52. Typing or keypad- 3/53  Camera - 3.5 / 5 ( 64 Mega is a myth )4. Gaming - Above Avergae5. Speed - Mideocare as expected from samsung processersMy biggest trouble is that it's not property supporting LTE or 4G network. Before this my 4G was working well with previous device on this it's not stable. Surprisingly it doesn't have 4G only mode under network setting hence it's  always picks up or switch to 3G only....attaching picture of network settingIf you are not bothered about cheenese products go for Snapdragon processers only..,-0.5886,negative
  The best smartphone at this price range bundeled with 6000 mAh with 25 watt fast charger ( Using samsung for the first time and loving it).Fingerprint reader is fast. For me battery lives upto 24 hr. If i do my normal tasking and with heavy usage it lives long 8_10 hr. Finding Samsung's one UI core version very user freindly and addictive. Camera quality is very cool. Shoots quality of pictures with proper details and single shot feature is pretty cool. Loving superamoled display,0.9643,positive

Then I cannot understand why the hell they delivered it to me.

I was used Samsung A 50 before I bought this, in display finger lock Samsung not working as expected but this side monitoring sensor working excellent and battery life is good cause its 6000mah battery you already knows and its light weight in our hands like freely carries, videos and picture clarity is good as expected and I'm uploading video to show you... totally you will be satisfied to buy it... if any cons I will upload after usage... use the tempered glass witch has i shown you in pics, it will perfectly fit to your mbl m31s, if you want to buy 3d, 6d glass you will regret after usage cause we want pocket friendly tempered glass right?",0.9922,positive
"  I shifted from MiUi to Samsung's One Ui after 5 years and I can see the difference. The Ui is quite Bulky and feels heavy with all the animations (you can reduce them altho). So the fast refresh rate while scrolling through the apps is quite visible. This is the only change I felt that I would rate among the Cons.Would Definitely recommend to anyone looking for a mobile with great camera and more importantly great On screen experience. The screen is just WOW you can't compare this with any other mobile in this price segment. So Non gamers with high battery demand here you go, this is made for you.",0.9652,positive

So after the call , I tried to switch off the phone, But no response other than vibrations. Then I received another call, since screen got blackout , Couldn't pick up the call. Tried to reboot the phone, nothing happened. I waited overnight. Next day morning , I tried again to do something. But nothing was happening. Thenafter by evening I took the phone to service center , They told the software trashed. They repaired and gave back in another 3 hrs.But I really can't believe that it's a 8 GB RAM and still getting hanged a lot. Soo depressed .Really don't know Is this a 8 GB processor itself.

I think for a normal user (like me) it is okey but for gamers it isn't good.

"  I'm using this phone for almost last 2 months so I would say I do know a lot about its performance.IN THE BOX: You will get Your Main smartphone and Charger(with c to c cable) NO BACK Cover so I had to buy a back cover and a screen protection. They should have provided a back cover for a Rs 19500 phone.In short: Build quality (3.5/5) is good but can be better in this price Range.It's weight is less than 200gms so works for me.Screen (5/5) sAmodled of samsung is best.Camera (4/5) is pretty good.Fingerprint(3.5 or 4) sensor is good but slow and its position sometimes makes things complicated.Battery: Excellent (15 to 100 in about 60-70 min don't know the real count but should be really close)Processor: (1.5/5) worst you can get for a 19k+ smartphone.Build quality ⭐⭐⭐ / 5 Smartphone design looks premium with glastic material but in the end its a polycarbonate back you will see fingerprints marks and have to clear it regularly to make sure it won't get scratches (I do use transparent a back cover bcz I love the phone's look)Screen ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐/5 You can't compare other phone's screen with Samsung its sAmoled screen is best in the segment.Fingerprint sensor: ⭐⭐⭐/5 Its good but not as fast as other phones in the same segment. Also, being it a side fingerprint sensor and also a power key you will have some problem but it also acts as a key features of the phone also you can do some interesting things from the key so overall its very good but i would have preferred on screen fingerprint sensor.Camera: ⭐⭐⭐⭐/5 camera is also pretty good. I have uploaded camera click in 64MP and a macro shot. Same for selfie, So overall camera is good and comparable to other same segment phone.Battery: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ : If I didn't play any game the battery will go for a whole day. In fast charging it goes from 15 to 100 in about 60-75 min I think. I usually charge it before I go to sleep after switching off fast charging mode (fast charging made battery life smaller, go to youtube for more info)Processor: ⭐/5  No good. My friends SD710 and SD712 works better than this. Even my sd660 sometimes play things better than this.I don't play much games(around 1-2 hr/ week) So after 2 weeks I installed 2 games, forget about rpg I sometimes play, this phone started to stuck in a game similar to candy crush (when all bubbles burst after completion) and i do close all apps from recent before playing and it's a 19k+ smartphone- _-So overall i will give 3. 5 or ⭐⭐⭐ to this smartphone as phone is not as good as it should be in this price range.",0.9955,positive
"  This phone is extremely good. I solely bought it because of its excellent Ram management and of course for its amoled screen. I'm not a huge gamer, so for everyday usage the phone performs upto the mark. Below I'll list some of its best and not so good specifications.Battery life is really good. It last a whole day with back to back usage from some light games to videos, music, heavy browsing and hours of calls. So battery is 5/5Camera quality is also quite good. Although it struggles a bit in low light but the overall output is really good. You need to use the ""Pro"" mode (if you're familiar with DSLR) to get the best out of the phone camera. Selfie camera isn't the best out there given the fact that it's 32mp. It's decent enough and intellicam is quite useful. So for camera I'd give 4/5.Ram management is the best out of the lot. Although it takes up a lot of power and ram, the switch from one app to another and back and forth is smooth and consistent. I'd rate full 5/5 for RAM.The display although amoled is a bit yellowish. You'll see the yellowish tint clearly on a full white background. And no it's not the settings. I've tried every settings out there possible but it's not the settings. It has more to do with the phone than the settings. Compare it with some other phones and you'll definitely notice the difference. But other than that, the display is very immersive. Display I'd rate 4/5.Now coming to the downside:Phone is quite heavy. I know, it has a big battery and as a result it tends to be heavy. So to each their own.The screen to body ratio is not the best out there. I'd say M31 screen to body ratio is better than M31s. It has an aspect ration of 20:9. In simple terms, it's taller but not wide enough. So some apps might not work well with that ratio.And yes, if you're ordering this phone, then bundle it with a back cover. It's a must with phones like this.Overall I'm quite happy with the phone. The pros outweighs the cons. And all phones will have its cons. So if you want to buy this phone for its pros then I'd say go for it. It's a solid phone compared to other brands. You'll really feel the difference if you compare with other phones. It's worth buying.",0.9917,positive
"  The main reason for me to buy a Samsung phone is its reliability. Have been using for 3 weeks and didn't run into any issue and the performance is good. The fast charger does it job well though I didn't do any measurement. The battery is long lasting. With my low-to-moderate use, it easily lasts for 3 days I think.- I find the phone quite good looking and Inifinity-O display makes it better. It is easy to handle. The back is slippery, so a back-cover is a must.- Fingerprint sensor on the power button makes unlocking phone natural, although one wishes it was a bit smarter (e.g. turn on the screen when *pressing* the power button, instead of unlocking which can be a bit annoying).- I didn't use camera much yet, and am not a pro. So, it's hard for me to say if the quad-camera setup elevates the photography experience to the next level. Tried the single-take and liked it somewhat.- Speaker is good enough for listening to music. Didn't try the dolby experience using earphones yet.- Some of the Samsung Apps have useful features, not found in the stock Android apps I used earlier. I especially like the ability in messages app to select and delete multiple messages. Also, the useful cards and category features are good.- The Galaxy Store auto-installs some apps like MX Taka Tak, Snap Chat (not everyone wants these apps!) and tries to trick you into installing it on different occasions. But, it's not difficult to choose not to.- The phone app is integrated with an opt-in spam-protection service, Hiya, providing a (limited) alternative to TrueCaller.- In terms of connectivity, the only feature I found missing is NFC, although I have never really used it on other phones too.Overall, I am satisfied with this phone and will recommend it. My reason for buying this model (over previous M model) were: bigger battery, fingerprint sensor on the side, and better camera.",0.9664,positive
"  Let's make review simpler.Pros:1. Of course, It's a beautiful Amoled display. I loved its punch hole display. Colors are vibrant and brightness is superb.2. As Compared to its predecessor Samsung improved OneUi 2.0 a lot. Its actually a good looking custom skin now with very few bloatwares. It got some very handy gestures and a beautiful Always on Display.3.  Its Battery life is great, I don't see any reason to turn off my data or to turn on battery saver mode.4. Charging speed is not as fast as oneplus or Realme but still Its charging speed is okay. I charged it from 0 to 100 percent in 93 minutes. Fully charging a 6000mah battery in 1.5 hrs is not that bad,5. Fingerprint reader is great, It works well even on  wet fingers.Cons:1. Front camera is a total disaster, back camera is just average.2. Mono speaker is loud enough for call alerts but not for media.3. Like front camera, Face id is useless, It works 2/5 times.4. No Gcam api support.5. A little pricey.Conclusion:Its a little pricey but still I'm giving it 4/5 stars because i was actually impressed with its beautiful AMOLED display, Colors are sharp and Vibrant. There are a few cons mainly related to its camera but like me you want a phone with good display, Full day battery life then go for it. I'm no gamer still PUBG and COD works well on medium settings, Camera performance is great in daylight conditions but as the sun sets its camera set down too.You can gt many better phones under 20k if you want a phone for gamiing but if your primary focus is not gaming, go for it.",0.9933,positive
"  1. Monster battery was what I thought honestly thinking that I'll get a backup of 4-5 days with this 6000 mah battery but still it's decent with 1.5 days backup on regular use.2. Camera quality is good but not ""one plus"" good especially in low light settings. However, is a decent pass off3. Very handy mobile. Easy to use.4. Loved the fingerprint scanner. Amazing sensitivity.Overall a 4/5 from my side. Enjoy the mobile.It's a good bit in the budgeted mobile category for 6/8GB smartphones",0.9767,positive
"  Where do I begin.....the phone has so many good things that the few major faults that it has can nearly be overlooked. The fingerprint sensor works extremely well even through a case, as for the camera,the camera is not built into the phone, the phone is built onto the camera with extremely good night mode,hyperlapse,super slow motion and extra stable video recording, what else could one want, it has some helpful features for my wellbeing like wind down(greyscales the screen),blue light filter etc. It ensures my usage does not affect my health. Overall a very good buy the only problem I have faced so far is its unusually short battery life for 6000mah out of the box, but it can be rectified but putting apps in sleep or deep sleep categories,to top it off it comes with McAfee anti-virus.",0.8167,positive
"  After using this phone for 5 days and exploring its every side, firstly I'd like to talk about the design, it feels super premium to hold like any flagship device of Samsung.2. Talking about the display, It just outstands, The blacks are deep blacks because of the super amoled display, play any youtube video in Full HD and you'll witness an immersive experience.3. Fingerprint is super fast, no doubts there.4. The glance on samsung feature on lockscreen makes this phone interesting in a way (Not sure everybody will relate to this)5. Talking about the rear camera quality. It is just amazing, I've attached samples(Normal & Wide angle, night mode) and you can see the quality of the pictures. I'll give 5/5 for it.6. Front Camera performs really good too but in good lighting conditions only. In low lighting it struggles a bit but not too much. It will do a decent job there.7. Battery of this phone is massive. I'm a heavy user and before going to bed at night, I manage to have atleast 30 percent of battery after full day of usage which is quite good.8. Charging time is also very less. It takes around 105 minutes to full charge from 0 to 100. It takes only 20 minutes to charge it 30%. For example : If you plug in the charger at 50% battery level, it will give you 80% battery in just only 20 mins which is quite good especially if you want to leave for somewhere and you have to charge your phone in a hurry.9. Dolby atmos (earphones only), Sliding notification from fingerprint sensor, The speaker sound quality and loudness are some underrated features of this phone.10. I ordered mirage blue because black variant wasn't available but I'm in love with this colour. It is better and more attractive than the black variant. So if anyone was having a doubt regarding this or waiting for the black variant, go for the mirage blue. You won't regret.11. I can actually say for this phone that this is a 'Value for money' product.",0.9852,positive
  I have bought two phone at exactly 12Am at Amazon prime day sale on 6th August 2020 am got the phone the next day itself.

"  Pros :Finger print is awesome.Display is good .Its really weightless in hands , even though it's 203g ,it feels like 185.Camera is good.Earphone effect is also good .Cons:This is not really the one UI , its one UI core which is a lite version , so inbuilt applock is not there , the applock provided by Samsung in their store really sucks.Its is really a stock android feel but could have included some gestures , which is a big missing in this.",0.2144,positive

"  This one is my another one smartphone from samsung. Guys i want to give a honest review about Samsung Galaxy M31s with 8 GB RAM and 128 GB of internal memory:1) Battery - Massive 6000 mAH battery with 25 W Fast charging and amazing backup.2) Display - Full HD SuperAmoled infinite o display is looks amazing. And display is crispy and viewing angles are also great. Watching Movie clearity on this display feels so much good.3) Performance - Exynos works great in this device and RAM management is also nice.4) Camera - camera give best results in indoor and outdoor conditions. Captured images and video quality is best than other brands phones.5) UI - Samsung ui is best among all other brands smartphone. It's quite simple and easy to use.6) Others - Audio ouput, fingerprint sensor, face recognition works very well.CONCLUSION - I'm extremely happy with this Samsung Galaxy M31s.Guys i suggested that don't read just specification of phones. yes samsung is some costlier than chinese brands with high specs.But Samsung's phones worth the prices becuase of it's features quality.First try it after reviewed it because good things are not cheaper, it's always costly. Thank you.",0.9938,positive
"  I am writing this review after using M31s for more than half month. And my verdict based on truly improved Samsung M series with my experience & tested after usage only.BUILD QUALITY.Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. My hand is small but still I found 6.5 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT.With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M31s feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.BATTERY.Main benefit of this midrange M series is it's maasive 6000mAh battery which gave me enough juice for nearly 3 days continuously. Tested.CAMERA.This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 megapixel with Single Take feature. Samsung gives what it advertises. Which made me to stick to Samsung brand. My usage of Camera is high & I found no complaints at all in focusing a shoot. Good color saturation. Well bright night shots. Macro shots r OSM. The depth & clarity of 64 megapixel is more developed in this M31s model. So no complaints.PROCESSOR.After using for more than half month I must say, Exynos 9611 works wonderful liquid speed when it is combined with LPDDR4X RAM technology. I have not faced any lag in PUBG or ASPHALT-9 hight end games, in medium setting which is good for battery saving. So 2.3Ghz speed accomplished. No complaints for the budget spent.SOUND QUALITY.After using for hours I found the Speaker this time Samsung made is much improved with Bass Stereo which was missing earlier. The in-ear delivers your ear the pure Dolby Atmos with clear precision and crystal clear bass effect.Bang for the bucks go for it, u will not regret,  I promise.",0.9984,positive
"  I have been using this phone for a few months now and this is surely a great phone by Samsung. I had bought the Mirage blue variant which I should say give this phone a premium touch. The fingerprint reader just unlocks the phone with no problem at all and the reader being on the power button just makes it more easy it use and doesn't miss the finger anytime. The battery life of this phone is too good as it easily runs a day even if I keep continuously using it ( and I do rough use). The 6000mah battery has got the power surely and the 25w charger chargers the phone in just 97 minutes which is amazing. The smartphone has a Super Amoled display which no question is superb to use. The smartphone has four rear cameras: a 64MP Intelli-Cam primary camera, a 12MP ultra-wide lens, a 5MP macro lens, and a 5MP depth sensor. The front camera stands at 32MP. The cameras have a lot of functions like Live focus, AR doodle, slow motion and many more. The camera demands a praise as the photos produced are of great quality and clarity. The Single Shot function is something innovative Samsung has come up with. I had heard by some Tech reviewers that the processor should have been upgraded at this price point but I didn't seem to have any problem while using the phone. I am having fun using this phone and for sure this is a great buy for me. If you are looking for a good phone under 20k with a premium touch, great battery life and great camera quality this is the one and thumbs up(Not a chinese brand).",0.9938,positive
"  Simply put, If you have an M30 /something in that or lower segments and want an upgrade under 20k, this phone is your best bet if you are not interested in buying phones from China Based Brands.* The camera is pretty decent but not the best.* Battery Backup is good* Functions Smoothly* It heated up after an hour of file transfers* Its heavy and therefore causes a lil discomfort.* Unlocks smoothly* The display is impressive",0.3958,positive
"  Was very excited to purchase this model during launch time. Bought 1 for my daughter and 1 for my mother. The one for my daughter has issues. Videos are not playing properly, and the phone is hanging a lot. Visited Samsung showroom and they formatted the phone but still the performance is very poor. It was my daughters first mobile and this is very disappointing",-0.8683,negative
"  Pros:Super Amoled DisplayGood Enough BatterySamsung Brand Value4+1 Camera UnitCons:Exynos 9611 processorGlastic Back PanelNot so super fast chargerVery poor signal receptionSo samsung and some tech reviewers hyped this device somuch. But it doest not live upto the expectations. It has the Sony IMX sensor, but it doest not produce true colors. If i take a pic of a red color, it shows you light orange tint. I was so excited with the marketing hype and bought it. The processor utterly disappointed me. At this price range(below this in fact) other brandings are coming up with Qualcomm Snapdragon Chipset, i still dont understand why samsung imposing their own Shitset to the user. People say, it is good for daily usage, i din even ay high graphical games, u can even notice the lag while switching apps. The processor is a complete garbage.And coming to the back panel, i know they cant provide glass to maintain the weight balance, but atleast it cud have been improved. It is very prone to scratches. It feels as if ur own fingers could damage the back.The Super Amoled Display is still protected with Gorilla Glass 3 while other are using GG5. The main plus point is the display itself. Buttery smoothy(only when processor is that smoother of course).Another main problem is the signal reception, its very poor.Dont expect battery to last for 2 days as Tech People are hyping it. Its just one day battery.And it feels as if its over priced. 16k wud have been a great deal.I bought this with somuch of excitement and simply it ruined me. Ive used it for one month and sold. If you still want samsung and can afford a lil more, go for m51.",0.9087,positive
"  PROS:-1. Great camera2. Good headphone output (basically the presence of Dolby Atmos , makes it a great entertainment device.)3. Humangus 6000mAH battery4.

Great Super Amoled display, great contrust, great viewing angle.CONS:-1. Bad build quality, after using 15 days back cover got scratches easily, though it looks looks batter , but I think at this price range Samsung have to gone with glass back2. Poor WIFI / CELLULAR connectivity ( LOW SAR VALUE)3. THOUGH IT RUNS SMOOTHLY WITH EXYNOS 9611 , but it is now 1 year old processor.",0.8952,positive

"   I am updating the review after using the phone for the past 1 months Pls reconsider if you are buying this phone. I have observed 2 major problem1.Freezing apps like whats up, Google, Chrome or any other app even the built in app. Suppose we opened one page while seeing that page lock the phone and wait for 2 minutes then unlock the phone the same app/page  doesn't move or going backwards just freezes.2. The slow mo video is not at all smooth, it slightly stops intermittently...it is not a perfect smooth slowmo..there is a frame drop in the video, pls check the attached sampleRest there is nothing special in this phone...overpriced for this type of quality....i have bought Samsung phone after 12 years..still they have not learnt to produce good phones.Over all there is nothing to get amazed about this phone...poor quality.Whats the use of buying.",-0.4638,negative

The image quality of the camera is good, its depth sensor and ultra-wide are amazing. I love the single take option of this phone. I am really sad that they don't give tempered glass and mobile case, in this price range all smartphone company gives this item. Samsung should give this item. If I talk about price then it should be 1000 or 1500 less than the present price. 🙂🙂",0.9747,positive

"  The Samsung Galaxy M31s is by far the best smartphone that Samsung has to offer. It is a marriage between the affordability and practicality of the M series with the style and flagship features of the A series. The phone comes with an exceptional Camera, monster battery which has been giving me minimum 10 hours backup with heavy usage in video calls and multitasking.  While most reviewers and gurus are condemning the use of the Exynos 9611, as a verified buyer and a multitasker with heavy productive use, I didn't  find any lag or inconsistency  in the processor.  It has excellent RAM and battery management  . The 9611 shouldn't  stop you from buying this phone as it is a complete package.  Moreover, in light of data breaches and the push for data localisation, the phone comes with KNOX hardware which is unheard of at this price.  KNOX along with the trusted name of Samsung makes this phone the must buy at this price point. It has an exceptional battery, camera,  interface  and security. I really  recommend  this phone to you.  Everything from the charger to the phone is made in India which is important  in itself.",0.971,positive
"  Its' around 15days of using phone. everything looks fine but Samsung has integrated some bloatware in its UI which will show full screen ads every time you unlock your phone, even ads are appearing during you using your phone. And worst part you can't get rid of them. Samsung must have clarified before selling that they have installed these bloatwares. I have read on internet that even Samsung's flagship phones are having these bloatware installed. VERY DISAPPOINTING MOVE FROM SAMSUNG. IT WII GIVE ADVANTAGE TO 'ONPLUS AND OPPO' OVER SAMSUNG. Till date ONEPLUS and Flagship phones of OPPO doesn't have these types of apps.",-0.8686,negative
"  The phone feels amazing on the hand and could visually compete with any higher end phones on the market. Everything is great but a couple of things to note:1. There is only one speaker and it is placed at the worst place possible. Right below at the right hand side corner. You will tend to cover the speaker with your thumb when you are holding it normally, which will completely block the sound.2. The indoor photos didn't produce great results. Some of the photos were shaky and focus was slightly off even with the firm hands.",-0.8116,negative
